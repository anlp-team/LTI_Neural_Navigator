The Eliminate Module uses a QA model to mask irrelevant objects in observation, while the Track Module uses a QA model to track the completion of sub-tasks. The PET framework combines a zero-shot subtask-level LLM planner and a zero-shot LLM progress tracker with a low-level conditional sub-task policy, allowing the agent to plan, eliminate, and track sub-tasks with progress tracking. The framework requires no fine-tuning and is designed to be compatible with any goal-conditional embodied agents. On the
The term for the discrepancies between increases in computational throughput and reductions in floating point operations, and improvements in wall-clock inference latency is called the "framework tax." This phenomenon has been observed to grow as hardware speed increases over time. The discrepancies are primarily due to bottlenecks introduced by deep learning frameworks, rather than compute bounded by kernel execution or memory-bound by data movement. Previous works have focused on convolutional neural networks in computer vision, but this study extends these analyses to transformer-based neural networks for NLP.

The proposed learning objective to improve the perceptual quality of speech is to use fundamental speech features, referred to as acoustic parameters, which are optimized at each time step in the utterance. This approach is different from prior work, which used summary statistics of acoustic parameters per utterance, and allows for more accurate and efficient improvement of speech quality. Additionally, the use of phoneme-dependent acoustic improvement (PAAP Loss) produces speech with more improvement in acoustic parameters for specific phonemes that are relevant for that particular parameter.

According to the study, ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for low-resource languages (LRLs) and African languages. The authors find that the number of Wikipedia pages a language has is a strong predictor of ChatGPT's effectiveness in translating it. They also suggest that few-shot learning offers marginal improvements for English-to-X machine translation, but may not justify the additional cost. The study provides scores and cost estimates for four LLM and traditional MT systems to help users determine which to use for a particular language. Overall, the study suggests that ChatGPT is less effective for languages with limited resources and fewer demonstrations, which may impact its utility for speakers

The study concluded that query rewriting techniques using large language models, such as ChatGPT, are not effective for improving the performance of multilingual, document-grounded question-answering systems. The experiments conducted demonstrated that query rewriting does not enhance performance compared to the original queries, likely due to topic switching in final dialogue turns and irrelevant topics being considered for query rewriting. The study found that a language-agnostic approach is superior for multilingual pre-trained transformer models in a bi-encoder-based dense passage retriever (DPR) system. Additionally, the study investigated the impact of query rewriting techniques using large language models and found that an LLM-assisted

TASTE uses longer user-item interactions to better characterize user behaviors. Instead of relying solely on item IDs to model user behavior, TASTE verbalizes items in user-item interactions, making the text utterance longer. This challenges the long-term text processing ability of pre-trained language models due to the increased max text-matching signals from longer user-item interactions. TASTE shows less effectiveness on the Yelp dataset, indicating that restaurant visiting behaviors are difficult to characterize with only interacted items and require specific modeling for each person. The phenomenon of hard negatives illustrates that these items are also high-potentially interacted with users and are

Using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs can improve answer passage ranking in conversational search. This is shown through experiments that demonstrate an improvement of up to 8.1% in nDCG@3 and 3.6% in P@3 on the CAsT 2019 dataset. The proposed Entity Centrality method involves building a conversation turn-specific graph using entities from both queries and passages given by any neural ranker, and then using random walks to estimate entity centralities over the conversation graph and rerank the passages. The results suggest that incorporating entity centrality information into the ranking process can lead to better retrieval of answer passages for the current question.

The proposed solution in the BASS paper to address the issue of training end-to-end speech summarization models on very large inputs is the Block-wise Adaptive for Speech Sequences (BASS) algorithm. BASS consumes the input in blocks and passes semantic context across blocks to encourage better learning. The algorithm can be used to adapt pre-trained truncated input models to longer sequences or train models over long sequences from scratch. The proposed model outperforms truncated baselines and enables the training of speech summarization models with very long inputs.
The mechanism that is critical to language learning in young children is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack & Woodruff (1978). This mechanism allows young children to understand that others have their own thoughts, beliefs, and intentions, which is essential for language acquisition. Unlike current state-of-the-art language models, young children actively acquire language through interactions with their surrounding environment and caretakers, and ToM plays a crucial role in this process.

One limitation of lexical exact-match systems is the mismatch between the lexical surface form of the terms and their implicit term semantics. This limitation can lead to inaccurate relevance judgments, as the system may match terms based solely on their surface form, rather than their semantic meaning. To address this limitation, the authors propose a new approach that combines the advantages of lexical exact-match systems with the strengths of lexical all-to-all soft match systems, resulting in an efficient and accurate text retrieval system.

The issue with reciprocal rank is that it can be brittle when it comes to discriminating between ranking systems, particularly when evaluating multiple highly-performing systems. This is because the low number of unique values of reciprocal rank means that there are likely to be ties in the rankings, which can make it difficult for reciprocal rank to detect significant differences between the rankings. This issue is demonstrated in many modern deep learning benchmarks, where the correlation between reciprocal rank and lexiprecision is often much higher than the correlation between reciprocal rank and the ground truth preference. To address this issue, the authors propose defining reciprocal rank as RR1 (𝜋
The proposed method for grounding pre-trained text-only language models to the visual domain involves integrating a language model and a visual model while keeping their parameters frozen.

Reciprocal rank is used to measure the effectiveness of a ranking system in retrieving the most relevant item for a user who is interested in exactly one relevant item. Despite its widespread use, recent evidence suggests that reciprocal rank may be brittle when discriminating between ranking systems, particularly when evaluating multiple highly-performing systems. To address this issue, the authors introduce a new metric called "lexiprecision" that takes into account the number of unique values of reciprocal rank. They show that lexiprecision is highly correlated with reciprocal rank and can be used to predict the ground truth preference between rankings based on 𝛿RR1.
