To improve the perceptual quality of speech, the proposed learning objective in the context of speech enhancement is based on acoustic parameters. This approach is different from previous work that used summary statistics of acoustic parameters per utterance, as the current estimator allows optimization at each time step. The values of each parameter vary over time in the utterance, so statistics lose a significant amount of information in the comparison of clean and enhanced speech. The proposed learning objective is to improve the perceptual quality of speech by leveraging fundamental speech features, which are referred to as acoustic parameters. Additionally, the PAAP loss produces speech with more improvement in acoustic parameters for the specific phonemes that are relevant for

MOSAIC is the name of the novel framework introduced for learning unified multi-sensory object property representations.  In MOSAIC, we leverage the insight that many fundamental object properties extend beyond the visual domain to encompass attributes like texture, mass distribution, or sounds, which significantly influence how we interact with objects. To learn unified object property representations, we adopt a two-stage approach, guided by text embeddings from a pre-trained text encoder. The process involves distilling knowledge from multimodal foundation models and aligning these representations not only with visual information but also with audio, haptic, or other relevant modalities.  The MOSAIC framework a
According to the study, ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for low-resource languages (LRLs) and African languages.

This is likely due to a lack of data and training for these languages, leading to a lower score compared to better-represented languages like English.  The authors also note that there may be opportunities to use ChatGPT to enhance specialized
The text discusses the vulnerability of multimodal models that allow users to provide images. The models can be easily attacked by generating adversarial images that cause the model to produce harmful or inappropriate output. The attack approach follows the standard methodology for generating adversarial examples on image models.

However, the recent trend in large-scale ML models is multimodal models that allow users to provide images that influence the text that is generated. The text does not provide specific examples of such attacks, but it does mention that the models can be found to be weak to adversarial inputs.

The four stages of the MultiViz method are:  1. Data collection: This involves gathering datasets of existing 3D point clouds and semantic labels. 2. Training: During training, the model is trained on pairs of 3D point clouds and semantic labels to learn the relationship between the two. 3. Retrieval: In this stage, the model is given a query 3D point cloud and it retrieves the most similar semantic labels from the training set. 4. Re-ranking: Finally, the model re-ranks the retrieved semantic labels based on their similarity to the query semantic labels.  These four stages work together to enable the model to generate visually plausible

Name: A-LOL (Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL)  A-LOL is a new class of offline policy gradient algorithms that can train language models (LMs) using pre-existing data. It allows for optimization using offline policy gradient, which enables training on any existing data. A-LOL is based on the single-action assumption, where the entire LM output sequence is considered as a single action. This allows for the calculation of training data advantage and the filtering of unfavorable instances. The advantage is the reference LM’s value estimate subtracted from the reward, which determines the benefit of each training instance toward the learning process. A-LO

Aligned text models may be asked to respond to harmful requests, but they will not do so. The model is designed to only respond helpfully to user questions while avoiding harmful behavior. However, an adversarial user may construct inputs designed to cause the model to emit harmful content, which the model should not do. We believe that stronger attacks may succeed in making text-only aligned models behave harmfully, but we cannot prove this claim. Future work will likely focus on this area.  In summary, aligned text models are designed to respond helpfully to user questions while avoiding harmful behavior. However, an adversarial user may construct inputs designed to cause the model to behave harmfully, which the model should not

The Andrew Project was launched in 1983.  Context: REDDY : People like Jim Morris, Al Spector and Satya (Mahadev Satyanarayanan, CS’79,’83) ended up doing a lot of strong technical work on the Andrew network and the Andrew File System. One of the great things that came out of that—at the time I thought it was rather extravagant—was the idea of a centralized or cloud-based system for files. Because there was this high-bandwidth connection, anything you touched automatically got downloaded. Many of the ideas that came out of Andrew have since become widely adopted, such as email attachments.

ORCA.  The proposed cross-modal fine-tuning framework in Graham's ICML 2023 work is called ORCA.  ORCA is a general cross-modal fine-tuning framework that extends the applicability of a single pretrained model to multiple modalities by aligning the representations of the different modalities and then fine-tuning the model on the target modality. This approach allows for more efficient adaptation to new modalities without the need for domain-specific pretraining.  The key difference between ORCA and other approaches is the alignment step, which helps to reduce the distributional shift between the different modalities and make the model more generalizable. This is done by

The four categories of low-level acoustic descriptors used in the TAP loss are:  1. Frequency-related parameters 2. Energy or AM-related parameters 3. Spectral balance parameters 4. Temporal features.  These descriptors are used to compute the TAP loss, which is then used to enhance speech in an auxiliary manner. The TAP loss is computed by taking the difference between the acoustic parameter values of the ground truth and the predicted speech, and then applying a temporal acoustic parameter loss. This loss is computed by taking the mean of the differences between the temporal acoustic parameters of the ground truth and the predicted speech.  The

One limitation of existing retrieval augmented LMs, as mentioned in the text, is that they should only retrieve information when they do not have the necessary knowledge to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate retrieval. This means that the LM should only retrieve information when it does not have the necessary knowledge to avoid generating inappropriate or unreliable information.  The text also suggests that the retrieval queries should reflect the intents of future generations. This means that the LM should generate queries that are relevant to the future generation's intent, rather than simply retrieving information based on the current context.  Overall, the text suggests that there are limitations and challenges associated with existing retrieval

SenteCon can affect predictive performance on downstream tasks in both positive and negative ways. On the one hand, the use of the same fixed prompt across different models can bias the model and limit its ability to generalize to new tasks. This is because the model is only optimized for the specific prompt it was trained on, which may not be representative of the diverse tasks it could be applied to in real-world scenarios. On the other hand, using the same prompt across multiple models can also lead to sub-optimal performance, as the model may be limited to only applying optimization techniques present in the prompt, which may not be the most optimal approach for the task at hand.  The study finds that optimizing directly for the

The conference where the paper 'GameQA: Gamified Mobile App Platform for Building Multiple-Domain Question-Answering Datasets' was published is the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL).  Context:  The methods used to create many of the well-known question-answering datasets, such as SQuAD, MS MARCO, and Openbook, rely on either reading comprehension or knowledge-grounded dialogue. However, these methods do not generalize well to other domains, and the datasets are not diverse in terms of topics, styles, and tones. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework for creating multiple-domain question-answering datasets

In 2011, the computer that defeated human champions on the “Jeopardy!'” game show was named “ Watson."  StarCoderBase generally obtains substantially stronger performance than all other models with released weights, and we find that random selection is a simple but effective strategy for improving performance in machine translation. We also find that few-shot exemplars improve translation performance, and that leveraging passages retrieved with generative models can improve open-domain question answering. In addition, we find that the ranking of models in terms of average performance across tasks is a simple but effective evaluation method. We do not find any systematic biases resulting from always using the same choice of exemplars, and we
Semantic Notion: In the context of the study, the semantic notion of agentivity refers to the degree to which an entity (e.g., a person, organization, or abstract entity) is capable of making decisions, taking actions, and being held accountable for those decisions and actions. In other words, agentivity is a measure of how much an entity is treated as a "full" agent in a given context.

To address the issue with training end-to-end speech summarization models on very large inputs, the BASS paper proposes the algorithm Block-wise Adaptive for Speech Sequences (BASS). BASS consumes the input in blocks and passes semantic context across blocks to improve learning. The proposed model outperforms truncated baselines and enables the training of speech summarization models with very long inputs.  In summary, BASS is an algorithm that adapts pre-trained truncated input models to longer sequences or trains models over long sequences from scratch. It improves learning by passing semantic context across blocks. The proposed model outperforms truncated baselines and allows for the training of speech summarization
One mechanism that is critical to language learning in young children is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack & Woodruff (1978). This ability allows young learners to understand the mental representations of others, which is essential for language acquisition. Unlike current state-of-the-art language models, young children actively acquire language through interactions with their environment and caretakers. The ToM mechanism plays a crucial role in language learning, as it enables young learners to understand the context and intentions of speech. In this context, the proposed model can help us understand how language learning works in humans. The proposed

We consider the case where one only has access to a system that inputs a prompt and outputs a generated response. We  3 2 0 2  G L. s c [
According to the text, the most important feature in determining ChatGPT's relative ability to translate a language is the language's resource level. In other words, ChatGPT is more effective at translating high-resource languages (HRLs) than low-resource languages (LRLs) and is particularly disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages. This is corroborated by a decision tree analysis of language features' correlation with LLM effectiveness in MT, as well as a cost comparison across MT systems.  The text also suggests that other language features, such as script, are not as important in predicting ChatGPT's MT effectiveness.
In this paper, the authors propose a new approach to investigate the voice-face correlation by modeling the voice and face geometry. The proposed approach is based on a voice-AM-face paradigm, which integrates a phonatory module to analyze the voice-face correlation. The authors aim to answer two core questions: (1) Is there a correlation between face geometry and voice? (2) If so, which part of the face can be represented by the voice? To achieve this, the authors collect a large-scale dataset containing 3D face scans and voice recordings from 1026 speaker identities. The results demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between face geometry and voice. Specifically, the

In the paper, ILL (Imprecise Label Learning) leverages a unified framework for learning with imprecise labels. This framework models the imprecise label information I, which is not provided as discrete labels but as an abstract variable representing the information about the labels. The proposed ILL framework aims to exploit the information from the imprecise labels to learn more effectively with inaccurate or incomplete annotation information. It also considers learning with reduced labeling standards, such as noisy labels, partial labels, and multiple label candidates, which are referred to as imprecise labels in the paper.  The ILL framework does not rely on any specific model for learning with imprecise labels. Instead

One limitation of lexical exact-match systems is the mismatch between the surface form of the query and document terms, leading to suboptimal retrieval results. This is because the query and document terms may not capture the full context and semantic meaning of the text, resulting in inaccurate matching signals. To address this issue, the authors propose an approach that incorporates both query and document representations to improve retrieval accuracy.  In summary, one limitation of exact-match systems is the mismatch between query and document terms, which can lead to suboptimal retrieval results. The proposed approach addresses this limitation by incorporating both query and document representations to improve retrieval accuracy.  (Sources: [37] and

Reciprocal rank is found to be brittle when discriminating between ranking systems, especially when evaluating multiple highly-performing systems. This is because the number of unique values of reciprocal rank is low, which leads to a high likelihood of ties. This result is consistent with theoretical properties of reciprocal rank.  In particular, the distribution of ties amongst system rankings for a given position of the first relevant item 𝑝1 and a random second ranking is predicted by the properties of reciprocal rank. The probability of ties is highest when 𝑝1 is small.  In summary, reciprocal rank is brittle when discrimin
We propose an efficient method to ground pre-trained text-only language models to the visual domain, enabling them to process and generate interleaved image-and-text data. Our approach integrates a language model and visual model while keeping their parameters frozen, learning translation parameters to cast images into text space, and text embeddings into visual space. We find that this enables better generalization to zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Reciprocal rank is used to measure the effectiveness of a ranking system for users interested in exactly one relevant item.  The lack of sensitivity of reciprocal rank is a problem because, in modern evaluation settings, current, high-precision systems may be difficult to distinguish. To address this issue, the authors introduce and connect reciprocal rank to ESL1, another preference-based evaluation metric. The analysis shows that reciprocal rank and ESL1 are highly correlated, indicating that both metrics are measuring similar properties. The authors also demonstrate that reciprocal rank can be used as a sensitivity tool for ranking systems, and provide a method to automatically compute the sensitivity of reciprocal rank

Pengi leverages Transfer Learning by framing all audio tasks as text generation tasks. It takes an input of an audio recording and a text prompt and generates free-form text as output. The unified architecture in Figure 2 enables open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks without any additional fine-tuning or task-specific extensions of the architecture. In particular, Pengi uses an audio encoder and a text encoder that can replicate a contrastive setup, but the model is designed to evaluate it from the generative perspective. In addition, Pengi is used to index a database by directly mapping the audio and text inputs to embedding spaces and retrieving the top k audios by their audio embeddings
In the paper, the real-world applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated in the context of language modeling. The authors show that their method can be used to extract and interpret the low-level representations of language models, which can be used to study the learning process and reveal the structural information in the models. The proposed approach is tested on several language models with different architectures and training methods, and the results demonstrate that the method is effective in extracting meaningful representations from the models.  The authors also propose an evaluation methodology that assess the quality of the learned representations based on their alignment with the task metadata. The results show that the proposed method is able to extract representations that are more task-specific and better

Computation offloaded to a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index in the Unlimiformer approach is the kNN search.  The kNN search is used as an approximation method to limit the computational cost of calculating the distribution over the entire datastore. Instead of calculating the distribution for every token in the vocabulary, kNN search focuses on the k nearest neighbors to the target token, which can be computed more efficiently.  This kNN search algorithm is used to approximate the kNN distribution, which is then used to interpolate with the standard LM output distribution. The kNN distribution is peakier than the standard LM output distribution, which can lead to better

In this paper, the authors propose a novel Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) architecture that jointly predicts tokens and their durations in sequence-to-sequence tasks. The TDT architecture extends conventional RNN-Transducer architectures by using a joint network to predict both token and duration. The authors also propose an optimization method that improves the efficiency of the model by using the forward-backward algorithm to derive the gradients of the TDT model. The proposed model, TDT, achieves better accuracy and efficiency compared to conventional RNN-Transducer models. The TDT model is trained with a simulated joint (JST) that is derived from the alignment of the input sequence
The effect of training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component is significant, leading to signiﬁcant fluency gains when training on both easy and hard distractors. Additionally, these speakers exhibit longer and more complex utterances compared to baseline models. However, the gains in general captioning ability are more limited and less pronounced. The inclusion of a sufﬁciently inﬂuential ToM reranker during the speaker training process improves speaker performance, with the relative gains higher when training on easy distractors.  In summary, training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component results in better performance on both easy and hard dist
