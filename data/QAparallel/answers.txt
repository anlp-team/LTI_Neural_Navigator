 Unlimiformer is fully non-parametric and can improve performance without fine-tuning, while Memorizing Transformers added additional weights and cannot easily leverage pretrained LMs.
 While Wu et al. (2022) applies retrieval attention to only a single layer due to computational constraints, Unlimiformer enables the use of retrieval attention in every decoder layer with individualized retrieval per-head.
 Unlimiformer is the only model that can provide benefits without further training, as it can improve base models without any additional training.
 Unlimiformer applied at early stop provides significant gains without any special training, improving the base model by, for example, 3.3 ROUGE-1 points on the GovReport dataset.
 Injecting Unlimiformer at test time results in the most significant gains, with improvements of 7.2 ROUGE-1 and 3 BERTScore points, while the training remains as computationally cheap as standard finetuning.
 The Book Summarization experiments with Unlimiformer include Standard finetuning, +test Unlimiformer, +early stop w/ Unlimiformer, Unlimiformer (retrieval training), Unlimiformer (random-encoded training), and Unlimiformer (alternating training).
 Unlimiformer outperforms both base models, BARTbase and PRIMERA, in BookSum. Additionally, the base model BARTbase, even with Standard finetuning, shows competitive ROUGE and BERTScore metrics.
 Table 4 shows that in almost all metrics and datasets, Unlimiformer outperforms the SLED and Memorizing Transformers baselines when using the same base model.
 PRIMERA experiments highlight that Unlimiformer combined with BARTbase performs better than the base PRIMERA across all metrics and datasets. Unlimiformer can also be applied on top of existing long-range transformers and further improve them.
 Unlimiformer can improve the performance of existing long-range transformers like PRIMERA and BARTbase, even when they were pretrained on much more data. Unlimiformer can provide additional improvements over these models across all metrics and datasets.
 The quality degradation of the reconstructed structure due to the misalignment of the rotation axis is more difficult to compensate by reconstruction algorithms.
 Post-acquisition sample alignment schemes include image processing techniques and iterative reconstruction-reprojection methods.

 CUTTLEFISH switches from full-rank training to low-rank training when the estimated ranks for all NN layers stabilize.
 CUTTLEFISH tracks the sequences of stable ranks for each layer at each epoch and measures the derivative of the estimated rank sequences for all layers using a rank stabilization threshold.
 Parameter K in hybrid architectures balances the final accuracy and model compression rate.
 It is challenging because it is impractical to achieve faster training speeds without fully training the model to convergence.
 CUTTLEFISH proceeds with factorization if the full-rank time is more than 1.5 times factorized time for a given threshold when proﬁling rank ratio candidates.
 Arithmetic intensity is the ratio of FLOPS to the bytes of data accessed. It affects factorization as layers with low arithmetic intensity may not yield a significant speedup even if FLOPs are reduced.
 Initial layers have small mn but large HW values, resulting in higher arithmetic intensity, while later layers have small H, W values but large mnk2 values.
 Factorizing the initial layers does not yield a significant speedup due to their high arithmetic intensity, which affects the overall performance even if FLOPs are reduced.

 The model discussed in Figure 13 is WavLM, which consists of a CNN encoder followed by transformer encoder layers.
 The audio inputs in the WavLM model are simulated as 2-second sequences sampled at 16 kHz to create 32,000-dimensional floating-point inputs.
 In Figure 13, it is observed that WavLM exhibits framework-bound behavior but quickly transitions to being compute-bound due to the large audio sequence lengths.
 Figure 11 discusses the latency of vision models that scale model depth and number of hidden dimensions.
 The batch sizes mentioned are 100 for WavLM (fp16) and WavLM (fp32).
 It is highlighted that transformer-based speech models exhibit framework boundedness but transition to compute-bound at small batch sizes due to long sequence lengths.
 The transition to compute-bound behavior for WavLM in Figure 13 is attributed to the large audio sequence lengths.
 The discussion in Figure 13 includes the behavior of WavLM, framework boundedness, compute-bound transition, and batch sizes.

 The focus is on determining whether a claim can be supported by evidence.
 The FEVER dataset is used to determine whether fine-grained claims based on Wikipedia articles are correct.
 FactCC and QAGS-based models detect factual consistency by checking if generated summaries or summary sentences are factually consistent with the given evidence text.
 RARR proposes a method that prompts LLMs to generate queries, retrieve evidence, and determine factuality directly.
 The paper introduces the challenge of factuality detection without explicit claims or evidence.
 Language models use various tools to overcome their limited knowledge and expand their capabilities.
 The unified framework extends the definition of factuality to include claims made in generated signals that can be supported by evidence under specific rules.
 Fine-grained factuality detection allows users to pinpoint inaccuracies and serves as a reward model for developers to refine generative systems.
 The paper suggests using instruction-following ability and natural language interface of LLMs for defining and extracting fine-grained claims.
 The concepts involved are prompt, response, claim, and evidence.
 To significantly compress the size of speech data and reduce training time while retaining performance.
 They are often used as input for the subsequent model, but can still be redundant.
 Methods such as de-duplication and subword modeling.
 Discrete units achieve reasonably good results in almost all the settings.
 The information of speech signals in a short window is represented by a single token or a few levels from restricted vocabulary.
 Discrete units substantially reduce data storage and transmission size while maintaining performance comparable to conventional features.
 Input sequence lengths can be drastically reduced via de-duplication and subword modeling on discrete units.
 Conventionally, spectral speech features are extracted from a fixed-length temporal window.
 Frameworks mentioned include connectionist temporal classification (CTC), attention-based encoder-decoder (AED), and RNN-Transducer.
 Tips include selecting SSL features based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and exploring other possible choices of discrete units.
 To analyze words that occur more often with one type of trigger word compared to other trigger words.
 2 words.
 To plot sentence embeddings in a two-dimensional space and visualize the similarity between data points.
 It measures the similarity between output embeddings of prompts with sexual identity trigger words and control prompts.
 It measures how society perceives an individual based on the words used to describe them.
 Outputs with queer trigger words had lower regard scores than those with straight counterparts.
 A post-hoc approach using a text-to-text neural style transfer task to preserve semantic meaning and increase regard.
 It is used with a trained classifier to detect words that influence the output towards a particular label more than others.
 Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT).
 Control and straight men outputs were similar, while gay men and lesbian women were closer to each other but afar from control outputs.
 The main focus has been on English.
 Arabic is considered underrepresented because most LLMs are primarily trained and instruction-tuned for English and are not able to extend their capabilities to languages other than English.
 Jais
 72 billion Arabic tokens were pretraining data for Jais.
 To address the limited availability of high-quality Arabic data, the authors trained bilingual models by augmenting the Arabic pretraining data with abundant English pretraining data.
 Arabic data constituted 33% of the pretraining data for the model Jais.
 The authors adopted ALiBi positional encodings, SwiGLU activation function, maximal update parametrization, and a custom-built tokenizer to enhance the performance of the model.
 Safety measures implemented include safety prompts, keyword-based filtering, and external classifiers.
 They were evaluated across Arabic and English NLP benchmarks, addressing reasoning, knowledge, misinformation, and bias.
 By making the models publicly available, the authors hope to enable further research and development, stimulating innovation and practical applications for the Arabic and global communities.
 The main focus of the OpenMatch-v2 toolkit is on Information Retrieval models powered by Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs).
 The code of OpenMatch is publicly available at https://github.com/OpenMatch/OpenMatch.
 Some key features of OpenMatch-v2 compared to the previous version include further improvements in dense text retrieval, re-ranking, query synthesis, unsupervised pre-training, and efficient data accessing, among others.
 PLMs have emerged as the foundation of advanced IR models, enabling novel models, domain adaptation algorithms, and larger datasets in IR research.
 Recent IR research has become almost exclusively PLM-centric and is conducted under larger, more diverse, and cross-modality datasets.
 OpenMatch-v2 was developed as an upgrade to OpenMatch to catch up with the latest trends in IR research, enhance flexibility, scalability, and support new-generation PLM-based IR models with improved domain adaptation techniques.
 OpenMatch-v2 introduces T5 as a new backbone for IR models in addition to traditional BERT-series models.
 OpenMatch-v2 supports CLIP-based text-to-image retrieval, structured data retrieval including code and product search, in addition to traditional dense text retrieval and re-ranking.
 Template-based data processing in OpenMatch-v2 helps researchers extract data from different datasets in a general way and provides an efficient method for data accessing and searching to handle large corpora with limited resources.
 OpenMatch-v2 supports algorithms such as query synthesis, unsupervised pre-training, and re-ranker score distillation for domain adaptation to enhance model performance in few-shot scenarios.

 They focus on LLM and its potential in MMT
 Even GPT-4 faces challenges on low-resource languages
 Instruction semantics can be ignored during in-context learning and cross-lingual exemplars can provide better task instruction for low-resource translation
 LLMs can acquire translation ability in a resource-efficient way, promising a bright future in MMT

 Community-specific investigations are an important future step towards developing effective counter-statements.
 The selection of specific individuals for direct exceptions is challenging due to the high number of marked incorrect instances and biases encoded in language models.
 Language models often encode biases and stereotypes derived from training corpora, making it difficult to produce relevant individuals who do not fit a particular stereotype.
 Producing accurate and relevant direct exceptions to stereotypes is important for understanding the role of counterexamples in countering essentialist beliefs.
 The text highlights the potential harms to workers who are subjected to offensive statements.
 The risks associated with automatic generation of counterstatements include potential misuse in distributed-denial-of-service attacks, perpetuating essentialist beliefs, and producing false and harmful generalizations.
 It is important to develop regulations alongside AI technology to limit harms and misuse in deployment of automated counterstatement generation.
 Annotators are encouraged to reach out to the authors with concerns and questions or to the Crisis Text Line to mitigate potential harms to workers.
 The text proposes working at the intersection of NLP and psychology as crucial for further investigations in countering essentialist beliefs.
 The text mentions the importance of considering ethical risks and the potential for misuse when generating counterstatements.

 A 2-neuron and 1-neuron classification/regression head is applied to the final embeddings of xt for discrete and continuous diffusion models, respectively.
 For all TSP and MIS benchmarks, a 12-layer Anisotropic GNN with a width of 256 is used.
 Specialized decoding strategies are designed for the two CO problems studied in the paper to ensure feasible solutions.
 The diffusion models are adapted to generate heatmaps by making appropriate modifications.
 Greedy decoding and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are used to evaluate the heatmap scores for TSP decoding.
 A greedy decoding strategy is used for the MIS problem.
 A common practice for probabilistic CO solvers is to sample multiple solutions and report the best one.
 TSP-50 instances are used as the main benchmark to compare different model configurations.
 The three evaluation metrics presented are average tour length, average relative performance gap, and total run time.

 The main focus of the text is on pretraining data design for language models.
 The text explores the effects of pretraining data age, domain coverage, quality, and toxicity filters.
 28 1.5B parameter decoder-only models were pretrained in the study.
 A temporal shift between evaluation data and pretraining data leads to performance degradation, which is not overcome by finetuning.
 The study shows a trade-off between performance on standard benchmarks and the risk of toxic generations when implementing quality and toxicity filters.
 The study concludes that there is not a one-size-fits-all solution to filtering training data.
 The text mentions that the inclusion of heterogeneous data sources like books and web is broadly beneficial and warrants greater prioritization.
 The experimental pretraining curation pipeline includes sub-selecting data from C4 or the Pile, pretraining a language model, and evaluating its change in performance over several benchmarks.
 MIT and Cornell University are mentioned as contributors to the study.
 The hope is that the findings will help support more informed data-centric decisions in language model development.

 GPT-4 and ChatGPT
 In-context learning enables language models to learn target tasks based on prompts without updating parameters. It is important as it helps models generate better outputs in NLP tasks.
 The final prompt is constructed by wrapping exemplars with a template and concatenating them together.
 A large language model generates output Y of the test sample X by maximizing the conditional probability p(P ⊕ T (X , Y)).
 For label prediction tasks, the prediction can be obtained in one-step generation.
 For sequence generation tasks, predictions can be obtained through sampling strategies like greedy search and beam search.
 Exemplars, which are supervised data pairs, and a human-written template are used to construct prompts for in-context learning.
 The symbol ⊕ denotes the concatenation symbol, such as whitespace or line-break.
 The language family direction table compares translation performance metrics across different language pairs.
 Performance metrics like BLEU and COMET are used to quantify the quality of translations for different language pairs.

Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct possible.
The purpose of the Carnegie Mellon Code is to outline the expected behavior for students at Carnegie Mellon, as they are members of an academic community dedicated to achieving excellence.
The phrase 'highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct' refers to the expectation that students at Carnegie Mellon should behave in a manner consistent with the principles of honesty, integrity, respect for others, responsibility, and fairness.
Being part of an academic community dedicated to achieving excellence means that students at Carnegie Mellon are expected to strive for and maintain a high level of intellectual, personal, and ethical development.
Members of the Carnegie Mellon community are expected to uphold a commitment to personal integrity, honesty without compromise, truth without equivocation and placing the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, and commitments kept.
It's crucial because the life of a student can affect the community as a whole. The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge.
Personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise and truth without equivocation, contributes significantly to the functioning of an academic community. It allows for trust among members which is essential in advancing knowledge.
When obligations once undertaken are not met, it can lead to a breakdown of the community's standards and trust. This is why commitments must be kept.
Creativity plays a crucial role in advancing knowledge within an academic community. It allows for new ideas and perspectives to emerge, leading to the discovery of new information.
Acknowledging prior knowledge is crucial because it gives credit where it's due. It also allows for a more accurate understanding and development of new ideas, as all information should be built upon existing knowledge.
The commitment to personal integrity, honesty without compromise, truth without equivocation and placing the good of the community above the self contributes significantly to the functioning of an academic community. It allows for trust among members which is essential in advancing knowledge.
When individuals do not respect these standards, it can lead to a breakdown of the community's integrity and trust. This can negatively impact the functioning of an academic community.
Acknowledging creativity in others allows for a sense of respect and appreciation within the academic community. It also encourages further development of ideas, as individuals are more likely to build upon existing knowledge when they know their work will be recognized.
Maintaining high standards for students contributes to the respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students who cannot meet these standards should voluntarily withdraw from the university.

This section describes the various programs available for students who are seeking a degree completion and certification in Master of Science in Data Science (MCDS) at Carnegie Mellon University.
The provision of community space and resources on campus aims to foster collaboration, interaction, and support among students, faculty, and staff.
Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook. Standard program lengths vary significantly, ranging from two semesters for some full-time master’s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs.
Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what conditions.
Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.
Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what conditions.
Standard program lengths for graduate students vary significantly – ranging from two semesters for some full-time master’s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs.
It is not specified in the text what happens if a student fails to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study.
The text does not provide any information about potential benefits of completing a graduate program early.
Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-granting program or department.
The text does not provide information about the statute of limitations for a Carnegie Mellon graduate student's degree.
Longer-than-standard completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.
Master’s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements
The purpose of Longer-than-standard completion is for Master's students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements.
A student may have an extended or longer-than-standard completion due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.
Master’s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are certified at the end
Master’s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program.
The significance of Longer-than-standard completion for Master's students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements is that they are certified at the end.
When a student has an extended or longer-than-standard completion, it means that they require more time than the standard period to complete their degree requirements due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.
The role of a graduate program in Longer-than-standard completion for Master's students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements is to remain in close contact with these students and certify them at the end.
 The main focus of lexiprecision is to improve the sensitivity of reciprocal rank in measuring the quality of rankings for users interested in exactly one relevant item.
 Cooper proposed ESL1 in 1968.
 RL1 stands for recall level 1.
 The text addresses the issue of reciprocal rank being brittle when discriminating between ranking systems, especially in modern evaluation settings with high-precision systems.
 Lexiprecision preserves differences detected by reciprocal rank while empirically improving sensitivity and robustness in a broad set of retrieval and recommendation tasks.
 Lexiprecision provides a theoretically-justified ordering when RL1 is tied, preserving all strict orders and avoiding numerous ties observed with reciprocal rank.
 Hasse diagrams are used to compare the total order of lexiprecision with the partial order of reciprocal rank, showing how lexiprecision scales with the number of relevant items and reduces tied performance.
 The paper contributes by providing a detailed study of RL1 metrics, best-case retrieval evaluation, and lexiprecision, demonstrating how lexiprecision improves discriminative power while being strongly correlated with RL1 metrics.
 The observation is that ceiling effects are inherent in RL1 evaluation due to standard ranking problems and the symmetric group over n elements in predicting relevance.
 Reciprocal rank is defined as RR1(𝜋) = 1/p1, where p1 is the position of the first highest-ranked relevant item in a ranking 𝜋.

 WebArena provides the environment as dockers and provides scripts to reset the environment to a deterministic initial state.
 The observation space in WebArena is designed to roughly mimic the web browser experience, including a web page URL, the opened tabs, and the web page content of the focused tab.
 The multi-tab functionality in WebArena aims to offer a more authentic replication of human web browsing habits compared to maintaining everything in a single tab.
 The three modes in which the page content can be rendered in WebArena are the raw web page HTML, a screenshot, and the accessibility tree of the web page.
 WebArena ensures that the observation can be input into a text-based model with limited context length or an image-based model with image size or resolution requirements by providing an option to limit the content to the contents within a viewport for all modes.
 The available actions in WebArena are categorized into three distinct groups: element operations, tab-related actions, and URL navigation actions.
 WebArena supports agents designed in various ways by allowing element selection either by on-screen coordinates or by a unique element ID that is generated when traversing the Document Object Model (DOM) or accessibility tree.
 WebArena generates unique user profiles on each platform to emulate the scenario where users of the same website often have disparate experiences due to their distinct roles, permissions, and interaction histories.
 There are 812 test examples provided in the benchmark suite of web-based tasks in WebArena.
 Annotators were guided to formulate abstract and high-level intents, ensure creativity in the intents, and formulate the intent as a template with replaceable elements as variables.

 The EMPATHICSTORIES dataset is a corpus of personal stories containing 3,568 total annotations, including empathic similarity annotations of 2,000 story pairs and annotations for main events, emotions, morals, and empathy reasons for 1,568 individual stories.
 The EMPATHICSTORIES dataset includes empathic similarity annotations for 2,000 story pairs.
 The data annotation pipeline involves annotating individual story events, emotions, and morals, then using these annotations to sample balanced story pairs and rate empathic similarity scores.
 Some themes across the main events of the stories include romantic relationships, positive life events, depression, family, substance use, encouragement, college and school, loneliness, youth, life changes, work, and trauma.
 The stories in the dataset are collected from sources like social media sites, spoken narratives, and crowdsourced stories, including online personal stories, crowdsourced personal stories, and spoken personal narratives.
 The story pairs for empathic similarity annotation are created using a sampling method that aims to select balanced empathically similar and dissimilar story pairs based on composite similarity scores computed using SBERT.
 ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) is used to summarize all the stories before presenting the pairs to annotators to simplify the task.
 Workers provide four similarity ratings on a 4-point Likert scale for each story pair, rating overall empathic similarity, similarity in the main events, emotions, and morals of the stories.
 The agreement scores for empathic, event, emotion, and moral similarity among annotators are shown in Table 3, with most common disagreements being at most 1 Likert point away.
 To handle the cognitive load and simplify the annotation task for story pairs, ChatGPT is used to summarize all the stories before presenting them to annotators.

 The quality of an automatic evaluation metric is estimated by comparing the agreement between the metric scores and ground-truth quality scores on a large number of translations from different MT systems.
 System-level accuracy calculates the percent of system pairs that are ranked the same by the metric and ground-truth scores, averaged over a set of language pairs.
 Kendall’s τ
 Different variants of τ are inconsistent with respect to ties and even biased against metrics that predict ties.
 A pairwise accuracy score, denoted acc∗, which ranges between 0 and 1, and a random metric would achieve 33% accuracy.

 The derivative of the Lagrangian w.r.t. the model parameter alpha yields: Lα = ∫2 ˜cdR(∂αξl + ∂αξr) + λ ∂ ∂t ξr + 2β ˙ξrξr∂αξr + β ∂ ∂t ξr + ∂αξr - ∆ 2 ∂αξr - α ∂ ∂t ˙ξr + ∂ ∂t ˙ξl - ˙ξr + ˙ξl + η ∂ ∂t ξl + 2β ˙ξlξl∂αξl + β ∂ ∂t ξl + ∂αξl + ∆ 2 ∂αξl - α ∂ ∂t ˙ξr + ∂ ∂t ˙ξl - ˙ξr + ˙ξl dt + µl∂αξl(0) + µr∂αξr(0) + νl∂α ˙ξl(0) + νr∂α ˙ξr(0) where lambda, eta, mu, and nu are Lagrangian multipliers.
 The expression obtained is: ∫λ∂α ¨ξr dt = ∫∂αξr ¨λdt - ∂αξr ˙λ dt + ∂α ˙ξrλ dt
 The final expression obtained is: Lα = + ∂ ∂t (cid:90) T ∆ 2βξr ˙ξr + 1 - ¨λ + λ + 2 ˜cdR ∂ ∂t (cid:90) T ∆ 2βξl ˙ξl + 1 + ¨η + λ + 2 ˜cdR ∂αξl 2 ∂αξr + + β 1 + ξ2 r lambda - alpha (lambda + eta) eta - alpha (lambda + eta) ∂ ∂t ˙ξr ∂ ∂t ˙ξl -  ˙ξr + ˙ξl (cid:0)mu + ˙λ ∂αξr(0) - ˙λ∂αξr(T) + (nu - lambda)∂α ˙ξr(0) + lambda∂α ˙ξr(T) + (mu + ˙η)∂αξl(0) - ˙η∂αξl(T) + (nu - eta)∂α ˙ξl(0) + eta∂α ˙ξl(T) (lambda + eta) dt
 The conditions set for the model output xi w.r.t. the model parameter alpha are: λ + 2 ˜cdR delta beta 1 + xi2 r lambda - alpha(lambda + eta) = 0 beta 1 + xi2 l eta - alpha(lambda + eta) = 0 with initial conditions at t = T: lambda(T) = 0 lambda ˙(T) = 0 eta(T) = 0 eta ˙(T) = 0
 The derivative of F with respect to alpha is given as: Fα = (cid:90) T -(cid:0) ˙ξr + ˙ξl  lambda + eta dt
 The derivatives of F with respect to beta and delta are obtained as: Fβ = (cid:90) T (beta 1 + xi2 r  ˙ξrλ + beta 1 + xi2 l  ˙ξlη) dt F∆ = (cid:90) T 1 2 (ξlη - ξrλ) dt
 The gradient-descent rule for optimizing objective A26 involves updating alpha, beta, and delta as follows: alpha_k+1 = alpha_k - tau_alpha F_alpha beta_k+1 = beta_k - tau_beta F_beta delta_k+1 = delta_k - tau_F_delta
 The summary of the overall algorithm mentioned in the text includes: 1. Integrate (A27) and (A28) with initial conditions (A29)-(A32) from 0 to T, obtaining ξr, ξl, ˙ξr, and ˙ξl. 2. Integrate (A40)-(A43) with the initial conditions (A44)-(A47) from T to 0, obtaining λ, ˙λ, η, and ˙η. 3. Update alpha, beta, and delta with (A51).

 The objective was to provide equitable exposure to documents of comparable relevance and work-needed, aggregated by protected attribute.
 The corpus and query data set is distributed via Globus and can be obtained via Globus from the repository link provided.
 The corpus consisted of articles from English Wikipedia with wikitext intact, provided as a JSON file, and compressed with gzip.
 Each of the track’s training topics was based on a single Wikiproject.
 Annotations were incomplete due to the large number of datasets resulting from the sequence of rankings required for the system.
 For training data, participants were provided with a geographical fairness ground truth.
 An undisclosed personal demographic attribute (gender) was used for evaluating the system’s fairness in rankings.
 The Wikimedia quality score ranged between 0 and 1, where 0 indicated no content on the page and 1 indicated high quality.
 For Task 1, participants outputted results in rank order in a tab-separated file with two columns: query ID and recommended article ID.
 Each task was evaluated with its own metric designed for that specific task setting to measure the exposure of relevant documents.
 The ACL60/60 evaluation sets are designed for multilingual translation of ACL2022 technical presentations into 10 target languages to enable further research in the field of multilingual speech translation.
 The dataset provides unsegmented audio, domain-specific terminology, and diverse speaker demographics to evaluate and improve model robustness under realistic recording conditions.
 Translating technical presentations is challenging due to domain-specific terminology, recordings with background noise, diverse speaker demographics, and unsegmented speech typically lasting 10-60 minutes.
 The evaluation sets were curated from professionally transcribed and translated presentations at ACL2022 to balance speaker demographics, accents, and talk content while considering recording conditions.
 Resegmentation involves dynamically segmenting the output using a given tokenization to minimize word error rate to a reference segmentation for downstream evaluation.
 Common evaluation metrics include chrF, BLEU, COMET for translation quality, and WER for transcription quality, with TER also used for translation evaluation.
 Post-editing can bias data towards the initial MT systems used for translations and influence metrics towards similar systems.
 Segmentation is critical to ensure consistent translation across languages and provide necessary context for effective translation to the desired target languages.
 Limitations include potential bias towards MT systems used for initial translations, moderate size compared to other datasets, and the risk of overfitting to specific speakers or content.
 The dataset provides a valuable resource for studying language processing in the technical domain and aims to offer a more realistic and representative measure for generalization in this area.

 The text suggests that LLM evaluators are much more robust to the choice of in-context examples when prompted for AUTOMQM rather than for score prediction.
 The text states that the behavior of in-context learning is quite similar for both reference-based and reference-less evaluation tasks.
 The meta-evaluation results in Table 5 show that using AUTOMQM leads to significant improvements in evaluating machine translation quality, especially for larger models like UNICORN.
 The text suggests that the benefits of AUTOMQM are less clear for smaller models like BISON, with both techniques (AUTOMQM and score prediction) performing comparably.
 The text mentions that the distribution of scores produced by LLMs prompted with AUTOMQM is much closer to the gold MQM distribution.
 SR represents span precision and MR represents major recall in the evaluation of error spans produced by LLMs.
 The text indicates that errors predicted by UNICORN have on average approximately 5 words per span, compared to approximately 2 words in the ground truth.
 The conclusion drawn from the study is that large language models can be further improved for machine translation evaluation by fine-tuning these models on fine-grained human judgment data like Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM).
 The text proposes AUTOMQM as a novel prompting technique that leverages the MQM framework for interpretable machine translation evaluation using LLMs.

 The main focus is on using a decoder-only architecture for speech recognition with CTC prompts and text data augmentation.
 The study aims to address the challenge of obtaining a large amount of audio-text pair data for ASR by proposing a new training scheme using text-only data.
 The encoder features compressed by CTC prediction are used as prompts for the decoder to refine CTC prediction using the decoder-only model.
 The decoder-only architecture simplifies enhancing the model by leveraging external text data for training, as the decoder architecture is the same as an autoregressive LM.
 The proposed model with text augmentation training reduced word error rates by 0.3% and 1.4% on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets, and by 2.9% and 5.0% on Switchboard and CallHome.
 The proposed decoder-only architecture outperformed conventional encoder-decoder models with a similar parameter setup and had an advantage in computational efficiency.
 The main contributions include proposing a new training scheme to build a decoder-only model for ASR tasks simultaneously augmented by text-only data and achieving lower word error rates with reduced computational cost.
 Audio information is provided as prompts directly in the embedding space of the decoder.
 The proposed model uses CTC prediction to efficiently generate prompts, known as CTC prompts.
 The proposed decoder-only architecture does not have source-target attention layers like an autoregressive LM, making it more suitable for ASR tasks.

 DeBERTA-v3-435M model
 To create a figurative language inference dataset for seven diverse languages associated with various cultures.
 Seven languages: Hindi, Indonesian, Javanese, Kannada, Sundanese, Swahili, and Yoruba.
 Figurative language is a reflection of cultural and societal experiences, making phrases difficult to be universally applicable.
 The study finds that each language relies on cultural and regional concepts for figurative expressions, with the highest overlap between languages from the same region.
 They influence the differences by shaping what concepts or objects are considered culturally significant and the sentiment attached to them in each culture.
 Understanding figurative language is important because linguistic communication often involves non-literal language, which can convey deeper meanings and emotions.
 Monolingual English speakers associate warmth with happiness, while native Hindi speakers may associate coldness with happiness.
 Tasks such as hate speech detection and sentiment classification would benefit from a better understanding of figurative language.
 It is important because cultural relevance helps language models understand how people in a specific culture view concepts and entities, improving their interpretation of figurative language.
 Concept shift across languages, particularly due to culturally specific examples.
 To ensure that translation quality of unrelated sentences is not impacted by modifications meant to improve translation of idioms.
 To evaluate model generalization since topics and vocabulary in Ted Talks may differ from movies or TV shows.
 Sentences were length-matched on the target side with corresponding sentences in the idiomatic set.
 To understand how much data is required to memorize non-compositional patterns.
 By generating corpora of different sizes containing occurrences of the non-compositional rule.
 Two informativity conditions: one where the context provides no information, and one where the context is perfectly informative.
 The number of encoder and decoder layers varied, while the hidden dimension and embedding size remained constant.
 There was a trend of translating non-compositional phrases literally, especially for smaller models.
 Clear context clues reduce the amount of data required for translating idioms effectively.
 There were drops in translation quality on idiomatic sentences in all languages, with lower automatic metrics overall.
 The three types of data are All, RGB-PL, and Depth-PL with corresponding values of 93.2, 94.1, and 93.3.
 PL stands for Pseudo-Labels.
 The value of RGB-PL (ks = 25) is 95.1 and the value of RGB-PL (ks = 100) is 94.4.
 GTlab stands for target-domain ground-truth labels.
 At τp = 0.80, the mIoU is 92.9 and at τp = 0.95, the mIoU is 93.4.
 Lt+ obj(p) leads to worse mIoU than Lt because it allows greater region-label influence, leading to more noise in region-labels affecting less-common classes adversely.
 The decision to adopt Lt obj(p) is guided by the observation that Lt+ obj(p) leads to worse mIoU than Lt, primarily affecting less-common classes adversely.
 The blue dashed boxes in Figure 5 highlight the semantic classes that the regularized version (DACS+PAC) is able to predict.
 DACS+PAC refers to the regularized version shown in Figure 5.
 Higher values of the region-label threshold τp lead to better mIoU performance.
 Generative adversarial networks (GAN), reinforcement learning, and convex approximations of metrics.
 Current methods were found to fail in capturing the acoustic parameters, and explicit supervision of retaining them improved model outputs.
 Previous methods attempted to use phonetic information in enhancing perceptual quality by implicitly capturing phonetic information in wav2vec embeddings.
 The techniques were evaluated on the Valentini dataset, which is much smaller and less varied than the dataset used in the experiments discussed.
 The method proposed in this text aimed to use a phonetic-aligned acoustic parameter loss to fine-tune speech enhancement models.
 The proposed method allows interpretability through both acoustic parameters and phonemes in the experiments section.
 Subsection 3.1 describes temporal acoustic parameter estimation, Subsection 3.2 describes phonetic-alignment and weighting, and Subsection 3.3 describes the overall fine-tuning process with the proposed PAAP Loss.
 The acoustic-phonetic weights in the PAAP Loss weigh the acoustic parameters differently based on their importance in predicting phoneme logits.
 The fine-tuning process involves predicting the phoneme index for each frame, using the argmax of predicted phoneme logits from clean audio, and performing calculations with the acoustic-phonetic weights.
 The evaluation results in Table 1 show improvements in various metrics such as PESQ, STOI, and WER when using the PAAP Loss compared with noisy audios.
 0.90
 The number of valid regions will increase at the expense of region-label consistency with ground-truth.
 The performance deteriorates.
 The mIoU increases with an increase in threshold up to a certain point (τp = 0.90), beyond which the performance deteriorates.
 DACS refers to a base method, while PAC is a visual comparison between DACS and the ground-truth under GTA→Cityscapes settings.
 The algorithm aims to adapt target-domain parameters using a pseudo-label and target training dataset, along with specific parameters and objectives.
 The Peak prominence threshold is denoted as δpeak.
 The weight αobj is used to control the effect of the objectness-constraint on the target-domain performance.
 The inputs include a pseudo-label, target training dataset with depth, initial model parameters, histogram bins, peak prominence threshold, RGB-segments, spatial dimensions of the depth map, region-label threshold, objectness constraint loss weight, and number of training iterations.
 The algorithm computes valid regions and region labels based on a threshold on majority-voting based region-label and region-wise frequency of pseudo-label classes.

The project was funded by three Pittsburgh foundations.
According to CMU President Jared L. Cohon, the reductions in vehicle wait time, travel time and projected vehicle emissions are remarkable.
Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl cheered the success of the pilot as a breakthrough in making their city's traffic system work more efficiently.
Stephen Smith, director of the Intelligent Coordination and Logistics Laboratory in CMU's Robotics Institute, tackled this challenge.
Their first step was to combine concepts from artificial intelligence and traffic theory to allow traffic signals to communicate with each other in real time.
After the successful pilot, the next step will be to expand it on a bigger scale.

 The three main components are input processing, stability detection and output processing.
 The voice activity detection generates speech segments based on audio packets which are then processed for speech recognition.
 In revision mode, both stable and unstable outputs are allowed to be sent, while in fixed mode only stable output is allowed.
 Stability detection is implemented using the local agreement two (LA2) method which checks for common prefixes in the output.
 The backend model in the text processing component is used for machine translation.
 Unstable text messages are processed by the backend model and the output is sent as unstable text.
 The evaluation framework involves sending input audio to the system and evaluating the final returned transcript and translation in an end-to-end fashion.
 The framework can be extended by deploying additional backend models for different languages, adding new streaming algorithms, or including custom components in the session graph.
 Prefix decoding allows sending a prefix which is then forced in the output, aiding in stability detection and output processing.
 The moving average calculation is used to determine if a speech segment should start or end based on audio input exceeding certain thresholds.
 PV stands for photovoltaic.
 PVPOT = PR x I x ISTC
 PR represents the performance ratio, which accounts for temperature influence on PV efficiency.
 ISTC is defined as a constant of 1,000 W m−2.
 The cell temperature (Tcell) is approximated by a mathematical formula involving coefficients a1, a2, a3, and a4 multiplied by T, I, and W.
 WPD is defined as the generation of wind energy over all locations and is calculated using a specific formula involving wind speed (W) and air density (ρ).
 NMAD quantifies the day-to-day, month-to-month, and year-to-year variability of renewable energy.
 The scaling factor α represents how quickly the wind speed decreases towards the ground and is used to estimate wind speed at different heights based on the wind power law.
 The simulated solar PVPOT is evaluated by comparing it to the observations using the MBCn technique to correct for temperature, irradiance, and wind speed.
 The spatial pattern of solar PVPOT differences between regions is mainly attributed to variations in cloud cover and vegetation density.

 The main focus of the text is on leveraging human feedback for improving language generation.
 In §2, the text formalizes the notion of human feedback and creates a taxonomy of different types of feedback in the literature.
 Feedback can be described by its format and objective, in terms of the desired model behavior.
 One approach mentioned in §4 is directly optimizing models against human feedback on their outputs, for example, using reinforcement learning with human reward functions.
 In §6, the text discusses existing datasets for human-feedback data, how these datasets are typically collected, and the impact that the collection process might have on the behaviour of the models.
 Dialog Generation is mentioned as an NLG task, where X is the space of possible dialog histories, and Y is the space of possible responses.
 NLG models are generally realized as a parameterized, conditional probability distribution.
 Evaluating the quality of generated text can be challenging due to the complexity and subjectivity of natural language.
 Various automatic metrics have been proposed, traditionally relying on n-gram matching or other simple heuristics.
 In the text, human feedback is considered the gold standard for assessing the quality of generated text.

 The Transformer architecture.
 There is a predictable relationship between language modeling loss and factors like model size, number of training tokens, and compute budget.
 Multimodal language models can process image and text inputs to generate text outputs.
 The Frozen model showed that it is possible to finetune a visual encoder to map images into the hidden space of a text-only language model.
 GILL is capable of both image retrieval and image generation, while FROMAGe can only retrieve images in their outputs.
 Large language models exhibit compelling properties such as the ability to learn from few-shot in-context examples and generate and process long text inputs.
 The GILL model architecture is trained with a captioning loss to learn to process images on the left side, and losses for image retrieval and image generation to learn to produce images on the right side.
 Text-to-image generation is the task of synthesizing a realistic image conditioned on natural language descriptions.
 GILL adapts a pretrained autoregressive language model of text, keeping most model weights frozen, and finetuning a small number of parameters on image caption data.
 The model needs to learn to process image-and-text content, learn to produce images, and determine whether to produce text or images at each step.
 The model learns translation parameters that map from image features to text embedding space, using a pretrained visual backbone and a linear mapping.
 The linear mapping in the GILL model is trained using the negative log-likelihood loss of the token sequence.

 LoRA
 LoRA does not add any additional inference parameters or latency due to structural re-parameterization design
 To enhance the fine-tuning and transfer learning ability for large-scale pre-trained models
 The main focus of the proposed model architecture is to jointly model intent classification, dialogue act prediction, speaker role identification, and emotion recognition with full integration of dialog history in spoken conversations.
 The joint model achieves comparable performance to task-specific models with the additional benefits of low latency and lightweight inference.
 The joint model successfully captures dialog context to improve the prediction performance of all SLU tasks significantly.
 The study recommends incorporating order agnostic training in the framework of future studies on jointly modeling different SLU tasks.
 The joint model learns to automatically predict in the optimal tag order during inference using order agnostic training.
 The work used the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), which is supported by NSF grant number ACI-1548562.
 The results show that order agnostic training can further enhance performance.
 The focus of the work is on spoken language understanding.
 The joint model takes a context-based approach for dialogue act prediction.
 The study experimentally confirms that order agnostic training can further enhance performance.
 The vertical distribution of aerosols over Beijing based on long-term LiDAR observations.
 From 8 to 15 February 2020.
 The aerosol extinction coefficient was highest in summer, lower in winter, and lowest in spring and autumn.
 The daily mean PM2.5/CO values showed a fluctuating increasing trend.
 The daily mean PM2.5/CO values increased about 1.3 times.
 It indicates that secondary transformation intensified as the pollution accumulated.
 The PM2.5/CO ratio increased from about 40.0 × 10−3 to about 120.0 × 10−3, indicating a gradual increase in secondary transformation.
 CO, NO2, and O3 increased along with the PM2.5/CO ratio.
 The PM2.5/CO ratio showed a decreasing trend.
 Scattered spherical fine particles dominated the heavy haze pollution event.
 The strength of the concrete has a great influence on the prestress loss.
 The effective prestress in S3 decreases by 86.6 kN, showing a loss ratio of 19.2%.
 With the increase in the length of the component, the sphere of influence of the secondary transfer on the concrete at the non-corrosion side decreases, resulting in a smaller prestress loss.
 The stirrup reinforcement ratio has no obvious influence on prestress loss because the concrete generally does not develop splitting failure due to the large cross-section size of the specimens in the experiment.
 The effective prestress decreases after the secondary transfer of residual prestress due to the fracture of the steel wire strand.
 The secondary transfer length is defined as the distance at which the steel wire strand stress increases from 0 to effective prestress after fracture.
 The relationship is that the maximum bond stress in the transfer length is 1.25 times the average bond stress.
 lt = 0.17 σp f (cid:48) t d, where f (cid:48) t = 0.26 f 2/3 cu and d is the nominal diameter of a single-wire strand.
 The equilibrium equation determines the transfer length where the bond force in the transfer length equals the actual prestress at the beginning of corrosion of the steel wire strand.
 The secondary transfer lengths of prestress of S1-S6 were calculated using Equations (4) and (5).
 It is generally not possible to map the meaning of text exactly into another language.
 Most NMT systems factorize the probability of generating a translation in a left-to-right fashion.
 The two common algorithms are greedy decoding and beam search.
 Some alternative input units include characters, byte pair encoding (BPE), morphological representations, and syllables.
 The two most common options are word embeddings and contextualized word representations.
 The two most frequent architectures are recurrent neural networks (RNN) and transformers.
 One major advantage is their ability to learn representations from raw data.
 One challenge is overfitting, which can occur when not enough data is provided for effective learning.
 The most widely used metric is BLEU, which relies on token-level n-gram matches between translations and gold-standard references.
 A shortcoming is that the evaluation is very dependent on surface forms and not on the ultimate goal of semantic similarity and fluency.
 The presence of exhausted CD8+TILs in AITL, characterized by IC overexpression.
 Investigating the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL based on the expression of IC and exhaustion biology-related genes.
 IC overexpression can induce exhaustion in CD8+TILs, impairing their effector function and leading to tumor progression.
 There were two clusters of CD8+TILs from AITL, with one cluster showing markedly increased expression of multiple IC genes compared to the other cluster.
 High levels of CD8+TILs and CTL may lead to exhaustion-related biological changes, immune suppression, and poor prognosis in AITL patients.
 CD8+TILs in the high CTL group show dysregulated expression of genes related to metabolism, mitochondria, and effector function, suggesting disturbance in normal metabolic processes.
 The DEGs in the high CTL group were 20 and all were related to biological aspects, while the low CTL group had 11 DEGs, with only 1 related to biological aspects.
 The enriched chemokines in the high CTL group could recruit M2 macrophages and Tregs.
 The result showed the gene expression differences in the high- and low-CTL groups related to exhaustion biology.
 In the high CD8+TILs group, there were more males (83.3%) compared to females (16.7%), while in the low CD8+TILs group, the gender distribution was closer, with 50% males and 50% females.

 IPI stands for International Prognostic Index.
 LDH>220 IU/L is a measurement that holds importance in the context of extranodal involvement.
 The response to treatment is categorized as CR+PR (Complete Response + Partial Response) or SD+PD (Stable Disease + Progressive Disease).
 The Kaplan-Meier estimates in Figure 8 represent the overall survival rate for different groups based on CD8+TILs and CTL levels.
 The text suggests using immunotherapy targeting IC and immunosuppressive cytokines in combination with routine chemotherapy to enhance patient prognosis.
 The model in Figure 9 illustrates the characteristics of CD8+TILs exhaustion status in AITL and its impact on patient prognosis.
 The main finding is that the higher the number of CD8+TILs, the greater is the proportion of severely exhausted CD8+TILs, leading to poor prognosis.
 The research findings can help predict the survival risk of patients with AITL and facilitate further mechanistic studies to develop personalized immunotherapy approaches.

 A prediction model of the effective stress transfer length.
 Residual prestress can have a secondary transfer, but some effective prestress may be lost.
 The loss of prestress is inversely proportional to concrete compressive strength.
 When the specimens are relatively short, the prestress loss increases significantly.
 Concrete strength has significant influences on the length of secondary transfer.
 Average error of 2.9%.

 The purpose of Prompt2Model is to generate deployable models from natural language instructions.
 Prompt2Model is a step forward from traditional special-purpose NLP models as it is designed to create models that are conducive to deployment using a multi-step process.
 Prompt2Model is based on a multi-step process of dataset retrieval, dataset generation using LLMs, and supervised fine-tuning on these retrieved and generated datasets.
 Prompt2Model can produce models that outperform LLMs like GPT-3 by an average of 20% while being significantly smaller in size, up to 700 times.
 Prompt2Model provides a way to obtain reliable performance estimates of model performance, enabling model developers to assess model reliability before deployment.
 The three main tasks demonstrated to show the effectiveness of Prompt2Model are dataset retrieval, dataset generation, and supervised fine-tuning.
 Dataset retrieval in Prompt2Model involves collecting training data by retrieving task-relevant annotated data to train the model.
 Prompt2Model automatically collects and synthesizes task-specific knowledge through three channels: dataset retrieval, dataset generation, and model retrieval.
 Using a pre-trained language model in Prompt2Model serves as the student model which is further fine-tuned and evaluated using the generated and retrieved data.
 Prompt2Model can serve as a tool for quickly building small and competent NLP systems, enabling the community to produce task-specific models efficiently.

 Due in part to span-based models not supporting categorical slots directly, which make up a significant number of slots.
 In-domain pretraining method outperforms models pretrained on SQuAD. Both strategies show strong improvements when compared to the vanilla backbone models.
 It indicates that pretraining in the QA task is useful for zero-shot slot-filling because it shows strong improvements when compared to the vanilla backbone models.
 More pretraining can be done by combining other QA datasets besides SQuAD, and even using other DST data when applying the pretraining step.
 Table 3 displays the impact of different question generation strategies: Generative LLM, Pronouns, Template-based What-is, Simple, and Manual.
 It highlights how small differences in questions can make a difference, showing that using third person pronouns whenever possible contrasts with the questions present in both pretraining strategies.
 The impact is that LLM-based strategies outperform manual question generation, while template-based approaches perform comparably to question generation without requiring access to a LLM or prompt.
 Due to the LLM misrepresenting the slots train-arriveby and train-leaveat, and the semantic differences in the train-leave day question compared to pretraining questions.
 It concludes that the zero-shot DST method presented requires no human input or domain knowledge through QA. The questions are posed by a generative LLM, allowing for easy addition of new slots and domains without extra manual workload.

 Saeki et al., 2022b built a massively multilingual TTS model.
 The work achieves zero-shot TTS from ASR data.
 The model freezes the language embedding layer.
 Fully zero-shot TTS performs zero-shot TTS without pretraining, while Text-seen zero-shot TTS performs zero-shot TTS with pretraining.
 The bottleneck layer is based on a residual network.
 The model was trained for 1.2M iterations using the Noam optimizer with specific learning rate and warm-up steps.
 The model architecture was based on Transformer TTS.
 The Noam optimizer was used for training the TTS model.
 X-vectors are used for the speaker embedding and added to the encoder output through a projection layer.
 Seven European languages were selected as seen languages for evaluation.
 The traditional solution has been to take actual physical measurements of the vocal fold oscillations or of the glottal flow.
 It is not always feasible due to the difficulty of solving the inverse problem of parameter estimation of phonation models through purely computational means.
 The inverse problem of parameter estimation of vocal tract models is described as difficult to solve through purely computational means without serious approximations.
 The paper proposes a methodology for solving the inverse problem of phonation models through purely computational means using the ADLES-VFT algorithm.
 The driving force equation in the one-mass model of the vocal folds is M ¨x + B ˙x + Kx = f (x, ˙x, t), where x is lateral displacement, M is mass, B is damping coefficient, K is stiffness coefficient, f is driving force, and t is time.
 The key assumptions include independence of asymmetry degree from oscillation frequency, stationary and frictionless glottal flow, neglect of subglottal and supraglottal loads, absence of glottal closure, and applicability of the small-amplitude body-cover assumption.
 The mucosal wave is represented as a one-dimensional surface wave on the mucosal surface (the cover) while treating the remainder of the vocal folds (the body) as a single mass or neglecting it.
 The body-cover assumption allows for the linearization of the oscillation model and simplifies the oscillatory conditions while maintaining accuracy.
 The center-line of the glottis is denoted as the z-axis in the one-mass asymmetric model of vocal folds.
 At the midpoint of the vocal folds, the left and right vocal folds oscillate with lateral displacements ξl and ξr which result in a pair of coupled Van der Pol oscillators.
 Weights are used to incorporate phonetic information in the acoustic parameter differences.
 The PAAP Loss calculates the weighted difference between acoustic parameters for each time step.
 STFT with a hop length of 160 and window length of 512 is used in the implementation.
 The PAAP Loss is used as an auxiliary loss alongside the original loss of the SE model to fine-tune the network.
 Data from the Deep Noise Suppression Challenge from InterSpeech 2020 was used to synthesize audio pairs for training and validation sets.
 The baseline models pre-process their input data slightly before training.
 The DNS 2020 synthetic test set with no reverberation is used for the final evaluation.
 State-of-the-art Demucs and FullSubNet models representing time domain and time-frequency domain models are selected.
 The PAAP Loss is weighed by a factor of 0.1 before adding it to the original loss for fine-tuning.
 The acoustic improvement is measured by the reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) between the acoustic parameters of the enhanced and clean speech.
 CodeBERTScore is an evaluation metric for code generation that encodes both the generated code tokens and the natural language input preceding the generated code, modeling the consistency between the generated code and its given natural language context.
 CodeBERTScore encodes not only the generated tokens but also the natural language input preceding the generated code, while BERTScore only encodes the generated tokens.
 The evaluation found that CodeBERTScore achieves a higher correlation with human preference and functional correctness than all existing metrics.
 Five language-specific pretrained models were released to be used with CodeBERTScore.
 LLMs have the ability to accurately generate long completions that span multiple tokens and lines, rather than just a single next-token.
 Evaluating different code generation models remains a challenging problem that requires an accurate and reliable evaluation metric due to the diversity in implementation and coding style.
 Token-matching metrics like BLEU and CrystalBLEU rely on the lexical exact match of tokens, which does not account for diversity in implementation, variable names, and code conventions.
 CodeBLEU attempts to lower the requirement for a lexical exact match by relying on data-flow and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) matching in addition to token matching.
 Execution-based evaluation requires datasets with hand-written test cases for each example, which is costly and labor-intensive to create.
 Partial predictions may lead to code that does not parse fully, and thus cannot be fully evaluated by CodeBLEU.

The Carnegie Mellon Code is a set of standards that require personal integrity, honesty without compromise, truthfulness without equivocation, and community service above self-interest.
Students at Carnegie Mellon are expected to meet high standards of personal conduct, ethical behavior, and moral integrity as members of an academic community dedicated to excellence.
The LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook provides guidelines and information for graduate students at Carnegie Mellon, including details on page 11.
The annual security and fire safety report provides important information about campus safety measures and procedures at Carnegie Mellon.
Members of the Carnegie Mellon community are expected to uphold standards and hold others accountable for these standards. They must also acknowledge the creativity of others, give credit for prior knowledge, and trust that these principles will be observed.
Students must not destroy the respect for Carnegie Mellon degree by their failure to meet these standards, as this will affect the community and its reputation.
Commitment plays a crucial role in an academic community. It contributes to the discovery, advancement, and communication of knowledge, as well as trust among members.
Acknowledging the creativity of others is essential in an academic community. It promotes respect and encourages new knowledge development by giving credit for prior knowledge.
When students fail to meet these standards, they can damage the reputation of Carnegie Mellon degree. This failure also undermines the trust and respect among members in an academic community.
The commitment to these standards contributes significantly to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. It ensures that students uphold the community's expectations and maintain its reputation.
Academic communities depend on trust because it allows members to collaborate, share ideas, and develop new knowledge without fear of plagiarism or dishonesty. Trust is the foundation for a productive and respectful community.
When individuals fail to uphold these standards, it can affect the entire community. It undermines trust among members and may lead to a decrease in respect for the community's values.
Creativity thrives in an academic environment when individuals acknowledge each other's work, give credit where it is due, and maintain a commitment to the community's standards.
Not adhering to these standards can lead to a loss of respect for Carnegie Mellon degree, damage the reputation of the community, and undermine trust among members.

 The two main improvements made to the reward model are using a better vision encoder with higher resolutions and a larger language model, and introducing a novel algorithm named Factually Augmented RLHF.
 The reward signals are calibrated by augmenting them with additional information such as image captions or ground-truth multi-choice options.
 The crowdworkers were instructed to prioritize responses that exhibit better multimodal alignment and minimize hallucinations. If two responses are free of hallucinations, they were asked to choose/create a more helpful one.
 The purpose of the Fact-RLHF algorithm is to alleviate the issue of limited capacity in the reward model and to improve the general capabilities of Large Language Models during the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage.
 The two factors to consider are honesty (providing accurate information and articulating uncertainty without misleading the user) and helpfulness (opting for the more helpful response when both responses are free from hallucinations).
 The three stages involved in the Multimodal RLHF pipeline are Multimodal Supervised Fine-Tuning, Multimodal Preference Modeling, and Reinforcement Learning.
 The reward model employs a cross-entropy loss function during training.
 The reinforcement learning stage trains a policy model to generate an appropriate response for each user query by maximizing the reward signal provided by the reward model.
 The reinforcement learning stage aims to address potential challenges like reward hacking by using a per-token KL penalty to prevent over-optimization.
 They trained an encoder-only model, specifically bi-directionally self-attentive Transformers.
 They used the Masked Language Modelling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) objectives.
 Tokens in the input are masked independently with a probability of 15%.
 They trained the model for 100,000 steps.
 IDs were excluded from the model training due to low annotation quality.
 There were 7,878 examples in the training set and 4,000 examples in the test set.
 They achieved F1 scores of 73.39% on passwords and more than 90% on names.
 Pseudo-labeling is employed to improve the detection of key and password entities.
 They annotated 18,000 files using an ensemble of two encoder models.
 The PII detection models surpassed the regex approach in detecting all three entities.

 The main focus is on building an acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) model to capture the mechanics of speech production.
 The MOCHA-TIMIT and HPRC datasets are used to train the AAI models.
 The research showed a 12.5% improvement in correlation on the EMA dataset.
 The 12-dimensional EMA features contain the midsagittal x and y coordinates of jaw, lip, and tongue positions.
 AAI aims to automatically estimate articulatory features directly from speech signals.
 The research uses autoregression, adversarial training, and self-supervision to improve the state-of-the-art in AAI.
 The interpretability is showcased by directly comparing the behavior of estimated representations with speech production behavior.
 It allows for generalizing the models to unseen speakers and improves the interpretability of speech representations.
 One of the challenges is that most articulatory datasets contain limited hours of high-quality speech data.
 The efficacy is evaluated using resynthesis-based AAI evaluation metric that does not rely on articulatory labels.

 The focus is on making scalable meta learning practical.
 SAMA combines advances in implicit differentiation algorithms and systems to support a broad range of adaptive optimizers, reduce computational burden, and exploit efficient distributed training techniques.
 SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8× increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8× decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms.
 Applications of meta learning mentioned include hyperparameter optimization, data optimization, neural architecture search, learned optimizers, and few-shot learning.
 Factors contributing to poor scalability of gradient-based meta learning include the requirement to invert a large Jacobian matrix, training instability, and lack of efficient distributed training support.
 Many gradient-based meta learning algorithms struggle with scalability in practice due to their requirement to invert a large Jacobian matrix, which leads to algorithmic instability and high compute/memory costs.
 The root causes are identified as base Jacobian inversion, a lack of algorithmic adaptation for adaptive optimizers, and the need for custom implementation of the backward pass of meta gradient computation.
 The main contributions include investigating the root causes of scalability limitations in gradient-based meta learning, proposing solutions to address these issues, and exploring the potential of scalable meta learning in diverse applications.
 The text proposes to approximate the base Jacobian with an identity matrix to address the issue of base Jacobian inversion.
 One of the initial solutions proposed is to expand the meta Jacobian via the chain rule to improve the scalability of gradient-based meta learning.

 Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE)
 They have a tendency to hallucinate and create factually inaccurate output.
 They commonly use a retrieve-and-generate setup where they retrieve documents based on the user’s input, and then generate a complete answer conditioning on the retrieved documents.
 Active retrieval augmented generation allows for continually gathering information throughout the generation process, which is essential for more general scenarios involving long text generation.
 FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method.
 Tasks such as long-form QA, open-domain summarization, and chain-of-thought reasoning.
 To address hallucination and create factually accurate content by looking up relevant information from external knowledge resources.
 The information needs are clear in the user’s input, making it sufficient to retrieve relevant knowledge once based on the input.
 Long-form generation presents complex information needs that are not always evident from the input alone, requiring continual gathering of multiple pieces of knowledge throughout the generation process.
 The goal is to anticipate future content by iteratively retrieving relevant information based on the prediction of the upcoming sentence to regenerate sentences with low-confidence tokens.

 The model demonstrates capabilities such as image retrieval, novel image generation, and multimodal dialogue.
 The approach is capable of conditioning on arbitrarily interleaved image and text inputs to generate coherent image and text outputs.
 The model proposes an efficient mapping network to ground the large language model to an off-the-shelf text-to-image generation model.
 The mapping network translates hidden representations of text into the embedding space of the visual models to leverage strong text representations for visual outputs.
 The proposed model outperforms baseline generation models on tasks with longer and more complex language, as well as on tasks that measure context dependence.
 The model is also capable of image retrieval from a prespecified dataset and deciding whether to retrieve or generate at inference time.
 This decision is made using a learnt decision module that conditions on the hidden representations of the large language model.

 The aim was to investigate the relationship between albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anlotinib.
 AGR was calculated by dividing baseline serum albumin by the difference between serum total protein and serum albumin.
 The main outcome was overall survival (OS), defined as the period from the date of initial treatment with anlotinib to death or the last follow-up.
 A non-linear relationship was observed between AGR and OS, with an inflection point of 1.24.
 The findings suggested that AGR was positively associated with OS, and for every 1 unit increase in AGR, the risk of death lowered by approximately 80%.
 Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is highlighted as the major type of lung cancer.
 Anlotinib is a selective receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets various receptors involved in cancer growth and development like vascular endothelial growth factor receptors and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α.
 Finding prognostic biomarkers is crucial to select suitable patients who will benefit from anlotinib, as not all patients respond positively to the treatment.
 The study suggested that AGR, by reflecting both nutritional status and inflammatory response, could serve as a valuable predictive parameter, especially due to its insensitivity to conditions like dehydration.
 The conclusion was that AGR level is an independent protective factor for overall survival in advanced NSCLC patients who received anlotinib therapy.
 The main focus of the IPA is to improve upon LLMs such as GPT-3 and reduce toxicity in generated text.

 The rank of the Tucker decomposition is calculated by iteratively halving all dimensions until the current compression ratio is under the given one.
 The Tucker decomposition is mainly used to reduce the parameters of the convolution layer.
 The Tucker decomposition is adopted because it is expected to represent the convolution weight tensor with fewer parameters than CP decomposition.
 The Tucker decomposition can be inferred without reconstructing the original tensor by swapping the order of computation as in SVD.
 CP decomposition, similar to SVD, can uniquely determine rank from compression ratio.
 The system was evaluated on the STOP dataset.
 The evaluation criteria used were performed by exact match accuracy (EM).
 The teacher model used a HuBERT-based feature extractor.
 The encoder in the Conformer-based middle model had 12 attention blocks.
 Adam optimization with warmup scheduling was used in the training of the system.

 The text suggests that AGR can serve as a prognostic tool for metastatic NSCLC, with a non-linear relationship between AGR and overall survival.
 The study used GAM and two-piecewise linear regression models.
 The inflection point calculated in the study was 1.24.
 Only when AGR levels were higher than 1.24, the risk of death was significantly reduced by 80% for every 1 unit increase in AGR.
 Lower AGR levels may reflect compromised liver function associated with advanced stages of lung cancer, where multiple indicators and factors contribute to patient prognosis.
 Caution is needed due to the small sample size potentially affecting statistical power and generalizability, as well as the need to consider the specific patient characteristics and treatment modalities of the study.
 Subgroup analysis helps in better understanding the independent association of variables from known risk factors, offering insights into specific group characteristics and prognosis.
 The ECOG PS score was identified as the variable influencing the linear trend between AGR and risk of death.
 Patients with ECOG PS score = 1 may have higher tumor burden indicated by a higher number of metastases, potentially contributing to worse outcomes.
 The relationship between AGR and OS is non-linear, with AGR positively correlated with OS when AGR is higher than 1.24.
 The focus is on evaluating informativity and fluency using different metrics.
 PICL substantially outperforms the mentioned approaches in informativeness.
 Methods controlling for fluency (PPL) pivot around PICL and achieve a similar level of perplexity.
 Human evaluation results show that PICL substantially outperforms Incre-RSA and E-S in informativeness.
 The primary finding is that PICL outperforms Incre-RSA along both dimensions of informativeness and fluency.
 ALBEF accuracy has a strong positive correlation with human retrieval accuracy for model-generated outputs.
 The trend shows that captions generated by E-S and Incre-RSA without controlling for perplexity are rated as much more disfluent by humans.
 Human evaluations are important to accurately compare the performance of discriminative captioning systems.
 The trade-off patterns for E-S and Incre-RSA are different from that under ALBEF, as optimizing for ALBEF accuracy induces more disfluent generation.
 The optimal informativeness under human judgment is likely to be achieved with a moderate level of disfluency.
 The main focus is to formalize differences in perceptual quality in speech enhancement models using domain knowledge of acoustic-phonetics.
 A neural network estimator is developed to accurately predict the values of non-differentiable temporal acoustic parameters across an utterance.
 Adding phoneme-specific weights helps optimize speech outputs to match clean speech values by considering the different behavior of acoustic parameters in different phonemes.
 The goal is to address problems with optimization of DNNs by using acoustic parameters that provide critical information about frequency content, energy/amplitude, and other spectral qualities of speech signals.
 Single-channel speech enhancement has greatly improved by transitioning from traditional signal processing techniques to deep neural networks (DNN) which provide better performance and flexibility.
 Classic losses fail to capture pitch, show relatively low improvement for low-energy phonemes, and are not highly correlated with speech quality at the signal level.
 The purpose is to improve speech outputs by minimizing the difference between phonetically-aligned acoustic parameters in enhanced speech and clean speech.
 The two-step approach involves introducing a differentiable estimator of temporal acoustic parameters and calculating phoneme-specific weights for each parameter to optimize the model end-to-end to match clean speech values.
 Emphasizing interpretability helps demonstrate the improvements made by the method and allows for a detailed analysis of the phoneme-dependent enhancement on acoustic parameters.
 Applications such as VoIP and phone calls, hearing aids, and downstream speech processing tasks are commonly affected by noisy environments.

The word 'share' indicates that there are different ways to distribute or make available information through various platforms.
 The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 60.8%.
 The proposed approach outperformed all previous methods by a large margin.
 The three stages involved are squeezing, recovery, and relabeling.
 The ultimate goal is to synthesize data in a way that achieves a certain/minimal performance gap on the original evaluation set when models are trained on the synthetic data.
 The objective is formulated as achieving ϵ-approximate performance on the synthetic data compared to the original full dataset.
 The primary drawback is the computational burden due to the unrolling of the inner loop during each outer-loop update, coupled with bias transference from real to synthetic data.
 The main objective is to disassociate model training and synthetic data optimization to enhance efficiency and avoid bias transference.
 The purpose is to extract pertinent information from the original dataset, encapsulate it within deep neural networks, and evaluate the impact of various data augmentation techniques and training strategies.
 The proposed approach reformulates it into a unilevel learning procedure by extracting information from the original dataset and encapsulating it within deep neural networks.
 The core idea is to adequately train and preserve pivotal information within a dataset within a deep neural network.

 The risk of death was reduced by 80% with every 1 unit increase in AGR.
 There was a trend in the association but it was not statistically significant.
 AGR was explored as a prognostic marker in advanced NSCLC patients with anlotinib treatment.
 They showed a positive association between AGR and OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib.
 The inflection point was AGR = 1.24, where AGR was positively correlated with OS when higher than this value.
 By using GAM and two-piecewise linear regression model, they found that the correlation between AGR and OS was different on the left and right sides of the inflection point.
 Albumin and globulin reflect the systemic inflammatory response in the host, influencing antioxidant effects and immune states.
 Low albumin levels have been confirmed to be a useful prognostic tool for lung cancer.
 They found that low AGR was a risk factor for cancer morbidity and mortality, AGR could predict postoperative chemotherapy efficacy in NSCLC, and AGR was associated with overall survival in metastatic cancer.
 The p-value was less than 0.001, indicating a statistically significant result.

 To identify errors within each translated segment, up to a maximum of five.
 Errors are categorized as Addition, Omission, Mistranslation, Untranslated text, Punctuation, Spelling, Grammar, Register, Inconsistency, Character encoding, Terminology, Style, Locale convention, Source error, or Non-translation.
 Error severity is classified as either major or minor, independent of the error category.
 The rejection criteria are used when sampling in-context learning examples for AUTOMQM.
 Major errors are weighted at 25, minor errors at 0.1, and neutral errors at 0.
 To derive quality scores automatically from the identified error spans and their classifications.
 A Non-translation error spans the entire segment and signifies the absence of translation.
 The same weighting scheme is used to obtain scores from errors identified by AUTOMQM.
 Table 9 summarizes the MQM error weighting scheme, which ranges from 0 (perfect) to 25 (worst).
 The final segment-level score is an average over scores from all annotators.

 Improved performance through data perturbation.
 By exploiting certain dimensions of speech signal variation.
 The number of ties for RL1 increases as 𝑚 increases.
 The number of ties for lexiprecision shrinks as 𝑚 increases.
 It suggests that there are very few relevant items in the rankings, resulting in tied rankings and no relevant items present.
 Both rrLP and sgnLP outperform reciprocal rank in detecting statistically significant differences.
 The lexiprecision variants capture the properties of RL1 while increasing the ability to distinguish systems.
 It is recommended to assess whether the assumptions behind RL1 metrics are aligned with the use case, considering the uncertainty over recall requirements and psychological relevance.
 The MSMARCO dataset is mentioned as an example.
 The call is to make labeling practices more robust across all domains.
 The study highlights the importance of considering tie-breaking in the evaluation process and provides a method for conducting more reliable best-case retrieval evaluation.
 Lexiprecision can effectively address the limitations of reciprocal rank in retrieval evaluation.
 It indicates that CUTTLEFISH begins factorizing layers after the first embedding layer.
 PUFFERFISH starts factorizing layers from the 7th encoder block for DeiT.
 Fine-tuning epochs are typically set to T = 3, 5.
 The batch size used is 1,024.
 During fine-tuning, the feed-forward network (FFN) layers FC1 and FC2 in BERT do not get updated.
 The CoLA task is considered to be relatively challenging.
 Scaled stable rank is used to avoid overly aggressive low rank estimations that could harm the final accuracy of factorized low-rank models.
 Applying FD to CUTTLEFISH did not consistently lead to better model accuracy.
 To ensure consistency with the VGG-19 architecture used in the experiments.
 The observation is that applying FD does not always enhance the accuracy of factorized low-rank models.

 The purpose is to ensure that each individual beam is expanded until it hits the stopping criterion.
 The best beam from the stopped beams is selected.
 Length normalization is applied because the stopped beams may contain hypotheses of different lengths.
 The blockwise streaming beam search algorithm applies beam search to the full-context offline models, whereas the standard beam search does not.
 The experiments use the MuST-C data set for English → German, English → Spanish, and English → French language pairs.
 The ESP-Net toolkit is used for the blockwise speech translation models.
 The encoder has 12 layers, and the decoder has 6 layers. The model dimension is 256, with a feed-forward dimension of 2048 and 4 attention heads.
 The offline ST models are evaluated using Simuleval toolkit. Translation quality is reported using detokenized case-sensitive BLEU, and latency is reported using length-aware average lagging (LAAL).
 The purpose is to enable the incremental user experience while processing each block.
 The difference is between 0.6 and 0.7 BLEU in favor of re-translation SST.

 The study aims to provide a snapshot of laboratory proficiency, identify issues, improve laboratory performance, and reduce inter-laboratory variation in seasonal influenza serology testing.
 Participant laboratories from various sectors returned data for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) assays to assess laboratory proficiency in seasonal influenza serology testing.
 The focus of the submission is to develop a strong target speech enhancement system for hearing-aid (HA) devices in noisy-reverberant environments.
 The Wavlab submission builds on the iNeuBe-X model, which is an extension of the state-of-the-art TF-GridNet model for multi-channel, streamable target-speaker speech enhancement.
 The main topic of the text is active retrieval augmented generation in language models.
 The purpose is to address hallucination and create factually accurate content by retrieving information from external knowledge resources.
 The proposed method is Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), which actively decides when and what to retrieve during the generation process.
 FLARE was tested comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets.
 FLARE uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, then retrieves relevant documents to regenerate the sentence.
 Short-form tasks involve clear information needs in the input, while long-form tasks require gathering multiple pieces of knowledge throughout the generation process.
 Examples include long-form question answering, open-domain summarization, and chain-of-thought reasoning.
 Humans gradually gather information as they create content, similar to the proposed approach for long-form generation with LMs.
 Existing methods may not accurately reflect what LMs intend to generate in the future or retrieve at inappropriate points.
 The research question is whether a simple and generic retrieval augmented LM can be created.
 The best filter length for UNSSOR is different from that of iRAS.
 The best performance of UNSSOR is higher than that of iRAS.
 Setting K to 5 and 25 produces worse performance than setting it to 20.
 A very long filter would have a large degrees of freedom to fit the mixture well, potentially hindering separation.
 FCP is less computationally-expensive as it requires inverting a smaller matrix compared to time-domain Wiener filtering.
 The filter length is an important hyper-parameter that affects the performance of the separation.
 The strong modelling capabilities of TF-GridNet and the contributions of the UNSSOR mechanism contribute to the effectiveness of the proposed system.
 UNSSOR works to some extent with TCN-DenseUNet, but the results are not as good as those obtained by using TF-GridNet.
 DPRNN has a window size of 4 ms, a hop size of 1 ms, 6 layers, 256 bases, 128 bottleneck dimension, and ReLU activation.

Curricular requirements, Capstone project or thesis, and Elective courses
Curricular requirements
To demonstrate mastery and application of skills learned in the program
Not specified, but students can choose from a variety of electives based on their interests and career goals.
The three types of requirements for students at MIIS are qualifying, elective and practice.
A student must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12-unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements and 66 practice units for a total of 150 units to attain the Standard MIIS degree.
A student must take at least 108 units (typically 9 12-unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses and 66 practice units to satisfy their degree requirements, making it a total of 174 units to attain the MIIS: Advanced Study degree.
Grade requirements ensure that students have demonstrated a certain level of skill while completing degree requirements.
Both the Standard MIIS degree and the MIIS: Advanced Study degree require 66 practice units.
Practice requirements are opportunities to apply and hone new skills while building state-of-the-art systems.
Both the Standard MIIS degree and the MIIS: Advanced Study degree require 84 units of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements.
The main difference in unit requirement between the two degrees is that the MIIS: Advanced Study degree requires an additional 28 units compared to the Standard MIIS degree.
The term 'typically' means that while a certain number of courses are required, there may be some flexibility in how these courses can be taken.
The three areas where students need to show breadth are Human language, Machine learning and Language technology applications.
MIIS-21 students must take two more LTI courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas: Human language, Machine learning and Language technology applications.
Yes, some courses used to satisfy a breadth requirement can also satisfy qualifying course requirements.
A student must complete at least 66 practice-oriented course units for both MIIS-16 and MIIS-21 programs.
Students must pass 24 units in directed study under the supervision of their advisor.
Directed study is a structured, task-oriented form of independent learning under the supervision of their advisor.
The three areas for showing breadth are Human language, Machine learning and Language technology applications.
MIIS-21 students must complete two more LTI courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas: Human language, Machine learning and Language technology applications.
MIIS-21 students must complete 24 units in directed study under the supervision of their advisor.
A capstone requirement is an experience that gives students significant hands-on experience with techniques studied in the classroom and an opportunity to work on a large software application.
A student needs to complete 36 units of capstone project.
The capstone planning seminar organizes students into groups, defines goals and requirements for their projects, identifies resources needed to complete it successfully, and helps them acquire these resources.
The capstone project is supervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly basis to monitor progress and provide guidance.
Students need to complete 6 units of capstone planning seminar.
The result of a successful capstone project is typically a major software application.
Students need to complete 42 units in total, which includes both the capstone project (36 units) and the capstone planning seminar (6 units).
A typical goal of the capstone project is to give students experience with collaborative, team-oriented software development.
Students are organized into groups during the capstone planning seminar.
Students must obtain a B- or better in all courses counting towards core requirements, maintain an average QPA of at least 3.0 for courses and projects used to satisfy degree requirements, and not elect the pass/fail option for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement.
That course may count as an elective towards the degree requirements.
No, pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement.
No, graduate students who require additional undergraduate courses to build up their core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.
The process for appealing a final grade is outlined under section 4.2.4 of the MIIS Graduate Student Handbook.
A student must obtain a C or better in an elective course for it to be counted towards their degree requirements.
The QPA (Quality Point Average) is calculated by dividing the total number of quality points earned in all courses and projects by the total number of credit hours.
If a student does not maintain an average QPA of at least 3.0, they may be subject to academic dismissal.
If a student does not obtain a B- or better in all courses counting towards their core requirements, they may be subject to academic dismissal.
The circumstances that may warrant a grade appeal include when the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or when the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university policy.
Yes, any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is considered a qualifying course.
Any two graduate courses (600-level or higher) offered by department can be considered as a qualifying course.
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade.
When grading is considered as a matter of sound discretion, it means that the final grades are not determined by strict rules or formulas but rather by the instructor's judgment and expertise.
In the context of a grade appeal, 'manifest error' refers to clear errors such as arithmetic mistakes while computing grades or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam.
The department plays a crucial role in the process of appealing for final grades. They are involved in approving the appeal and ensuring that all procedures are followed correctly.
The significance of considering 600-level or higher courses as qualifying courses is that they are typically more advanced and specialized, providing students with a deeper understanding of their field.
It means that once a grade has been assigned by an instructor, it is not often altered unless there are exceptional circumstances and both the instructor and department agree to make changes.

MIIS program arranges an on-campus internship with a university-based project.
No, international students are required to consult with the Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract.
A faculty advisor guides the education and monitors the progress of each student through the program. They also supervise the student's directed study projects.
Students are expected to select their advisors during the first month of the program.
Attending LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks allows students to learn about faculty interests and areas, which can help them select an appropriate advisor.
International students must consult with the Office of International Education to ensure that the university is in compliance with immigration laws for F & J status students.
A faculty advisor has a personal student-advisor relationship, providing career advice and guiding the education of each student through the program.
Students are not explicitly mentioned to be attending any specific number of LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks. However, they are expected to attend at least one during the first month of the program.
Directed study projects play a significant role in the education and progress monitoring of students through the program. They are supervised by faculty advisors, ensuring that each student receives necessary mentoring.
If a student has not found an advisor after one month in the program, the Program Director will assign an advisor to the student.
To change advisors, a student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The new and old advisors need to agree to the change.
It's beneficial for students not to switch advisors late in their graduate studies because forming a strong relationship with an advisor takes time and switching can disrupt the progress of their graduate studies.
The Program Director plays a crucial role in approving an advising relationship between a student and faculty member. If a student wants to switch advisors, they need to make a request to the Program Director.
The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. Students are encouraged to seek out faculty members with expertise in their area of interest and proactively meet individually with potential advisors.
The SCS policy requires that both the new and old advisors agree to a change in advisors. This policy has been followed by MIIS Graduate Student Handbook.
Faculty members are expected to serve as advisors for students in their area of expertise. They should agree to an advising relationship with a student if both parties mutually agree.
The MIIS Graduate Student Handbook provides guidelines and information for students regarding their academic journey, including advising relationships.
Page 17 of the MIIS Graduate Student Handbook contains information about how to change advisors and what happens if a student has not found an advisor after one month.

 Latency improvements of 959, 1395, and 752 milliseconds were observed for English to German, Spanish, and French, respectively.
 Approximately 20% reduction in computational complexity was observed with the IBWBS.
 Quality improvement of 6.2, 5.7, and 8.3 BLEU scores were observed for English to German, Spanish, and French, respectively.
 The IBWBS helps reduce the computational complexity by approximately 20%.
 Figure 2a illustrates the latency control using the block size.
 Improvements in both quality and latency (by more than 2 BLEU and by 500 ms, respectively) were observed for English to French.
 Approximately 20 to 30% reduction in computational complexity was observed for both local agreement and hold-n policies.
 The proposed changes brought improvement to both quality and latency.
 It incorporates local agreement or hold-n policies for quality-latency control without the need to retrain the model.
 The framework successfully applied quality and performance improvements compared to the standard beam search.
 The challenge is the accurate measurement of the fitness function, especially in apps that run in more than 150ms.
 The program representation consists of a list of edits that are applied sequentially to the source code.
 In the Fitness section, the application is patched, compiled, and run through unit tests. If all unit tests pass, the patch is considered valid, and the property being improved is measured.
 Robolectric allows for simulation-based testing of application components within a local JVM, which helps in testing any application component with fast local tests.
 The most complained about non-functional properties are execution time, memory usage, bandwidth, and energy usage.
 The statement is supported by the findings of Callan and Petke (2022a), who found that improvements demonstrated with Robolectric testing translated to actual improvements on real devices in all cases.
 The primary technique mentioned is prefetching.
 It is important due to limited resources and the ability to evolve patches that balance different trade-offs, producing Pareto fronts of solutions.
 The initial population consists of individuals with single random edits, which are further guided by a search algorithm that applies mutations and crossovers.
 Patches are created through mutation and crossover on the list of edits representation.
 The text discusses the effectiveness of a partial selection scheme in reducing labeling costs in different querying methods for information extraction tasks.
 The partial selection scheme requires lower labeling costs than full annotation to reach the upper bound.
 The text suggests that it would be interesting to explore combining the method with more complex acquisition functions, such as those considering representativeness.
 Figure 9 shows the mention extraction results for the event extraction task.
 PA can obtain similar results to FA with the same reading texts and less mention labeling cost.
 FA relation extraction cost is measured by two times the annotated entities, while PA counts the number of queried relations.
 The high weight (β) of the second sub-task for relations (or event arguments) is considered when calculating sentence uncertainty.
 The text suggests exploring better ways to enhance both sub-tasks, possibly with an adaptive combination scheme.
 Figure 10 shows the results of the extraction of entity mentions and relations for the relation extraction task on ACE05.
 Some mention extraction results show less obvious differences between the AL strategies over the random baseline, possibly due to a focus on the second sub-task for relations.

 The parser models the overall dialogue structure using tree distributions, which lowers the burden of predicting long-range links.
 The benefit is the length robustness of the parser, especially when the dialogue becomes longer.
 Both parsers struggle to predict low-resource relations, marking an important direction for future work.
 The performance drop of the parser is less than that of the best baseline, demonstrating the robustness of the parser.

 FLARE outperforms all baseline on all tasks/datasets
 The task has a clear definition and specific objective of producing the final answer through a 2-hop reasoning process
 Identifying ambiguous aspects is challenging even for humans, providing a generic hint helps LMs to stay on topic
 Question decomposition
 Manual exemplar annotation is not necessary for effective future-aware retrieval
 The improvement of retrieving using the previous sentence is relatively small
 They are more reliable than metrics computed over all tokens
 Using the next sentence for retrieval is clearly better than using the previous sentence
 A pre-trained BERT was used for the English side.
 The back translation strategy for Bribri–Spanish NMT transformers was explored.
 Spanish text or text extracted from PDFs and other sources can be used.
 Even though morphological segmentation has less perplexity at the language modeling time, it is still under-performing or equivalent against BPEs for MT.
 Supervised morphological segmentation under-perform unsupervised.
 A morphological segmentation, or a combination of BPEs and morphological segmentation, works better.
 Training word embeddings for Guarani–Spanish translation is highlighted.
 Transfer learning from multilingual systems has been tried with limited results.
 Fine-tuning a Spanish–English model together with ILA, along with a careful preprocessing and filtering step, has been the most successful strategy.
 They advocate for including community members as co-authors and considering data and technology sovereignty.
 The total token count is not immediately obvious to users except through a separate tokenizer interface.
 Most services limit daily token usage to a small number of tokens per use.
 Proposed approaches range from defining tokens as whitespace-delimited words to defining tokens as characters or bytes.
 BBPE is a byte-level base vocabulary with only 256 tokens used in modern language modeling efforts for its effectiveness.
 The main focus is on investigating the impact of tokenization strategy on LM API cost disparity and downstream task performance across different languages.
 Non-uniform tokenization rates can lead to significantly high usage costs for less represented languages.
 High fragmentation rates can negatively affect the in-context learning performance, resulting in reduced model utility.
 The implications revolve around certain languages being more expensive and less effective, hindering uniform accessibility of the technology.
 The two models are ChatGPT and BLOOMZ, with ChatGPT being closed and BLOOMZ being open-source trained on multiple languages.
 The Huggingface API has a context limit of 1000 tokens for BLOOMZ.
 The batch size used in the experiment is 128.
 The binary accuracy is used as both the local validation score and evaluation metric.
 All baselines are implemented in PyTorch 1.12.1.
 The reward-and-slash design is deployed in a private blockchain using Ethereum smart contracts.
 The value of ϵ is set to 0.05.
 The first baseline is the Oracle approach, a centralized baseline without malicious attacks, which provides the upper-bound performance of the experiment.
 Four baselines are considered in the study.
 In FedAVG w/ block, 90% of the clients are used as voters.
 A too small ϵ value can cause large oscillation, which slows the convergence.
 Malicious voters will be eliminated from the system shortly, with their average tokens declining to 0 within approximately 40 epochs.
 Frame synchronous beam search is an algorithm that performs pruning at every input frame during the search process.
 Frame synchronous beam search depends on explicit alignment, while label synchronous beam search does not.
 LM shallow fusion is a score combination method that linearly adds the language model score to the end-to-end ASR scores during beam search.
 Classical approaches to beam search for these variants are based on weighted finite state transducers and they are used for frame synchronous beam search.
 Asynchronous score fusion handles the mismatch by incorporating the language model score in the label transition state.
 Lexical constraint during score fusion is used to incorporate word-based lexical constraints for ASR, especially in end-to-end ASR using letter or token units.
 Vectorization enables the replacement of score accumulation steps with vector-matrix operations, leveraging parallel computing capabilities for significant speedups.
 The TLG transducer is composed of the token unit, word lexicon, and word-based language transducers, and it helps incorporate lexical constraints during beam search.
 Vectorization allows for parallel processing of multiple utterances, resulting in faster decoding and significant speedups.
 The frame synchronous algorithm can easily extend to online and streaming decoding by using explicit alignment information with input frame and output token.

 The paper focuses on the end-to-end (E2E) SLU model for minimization of computational cost towards on-device processing.
 SVD and Tucker decomposition are mentioned for model miniaturization.
 Tensor decomposition helps reduce the model size by applying singular value decomposition to linear layers and Tucker decomposition to convolution layers.
 The purpose of using tensor decompositions in the E2E model is to flexibly control the number of parameters without changing feature dimensions.
 Singular value decomposition (SVD) is stable and widely used for parameter reduction.
 In Tucker decomposition, the parameter size is controlled by decomposing the parameter tensor into a core tensor and factor matrices.
 The algorithm aims to halve the size for Tucker decomposition by adjusting the dimensions R, S, and T.
 CP decomposition is explored for applying high-order tensors in the context of model compression.
 Model compression is essential for on-device processing to reduce power consumption and enable faster computation on edge devices.
 Combining convolution and self-attention operations in these models makes them more efficiently compressed using tensor decomposition techniques.

 End-to-end question-answering experiments on NQ, OTT-QA, and HotpotQA.
 The Fusion-in-Encoder (FiE) model was used for NQ and OTT-QA experiments.
 Top-100 passages for NQ and top-50 evidence chains for OTT-QA.
 A separate reader model was trained to predict supporting sentences in addition to the answer span.
 COS learns five reusable skills for ODQA via multi-task learning.
 One limitation is that the reranking expert only learns to rerank single-step results. Another limitation is that the current pretraining setup only includes three bi-encoder tasks.
 The model, coupled with the FiE, outperforms previous baselines by large margins on OTT-QA.
 Separate models were trained independently for each dataset, NQ, OTT-QA, and HotpotQA.
 The superior performance of the model on OTT-QA is mainly due to COS.
 The COS model achieves competitive QA performance against previous SOTA with improved exact match accuracy.
The purpose of using CAPTCHAs, as per the text, is to prevent bots from accessing a website and to ensure that there's a human behind any other computer.
Visual-perception based CAPTCHAs, which rely solely on reading text or performing other visual tasks, prevent visually impaired users from accessing the protected resource and may make a site incompatible with Section 508.
The text suggests that accessibility, image security, and script security should be considered while implementing CAPTCHAs. Accessibility ensures that visually impaired users can also use the protected resource, image security involves distorting random images of text before presenting them to the user, and script security aims at making sure there are no easy ways around it at the script level.
Many CAPTCHA implementations use undistorted text or only minor distortions, making them vulnerable to simple automated attacks.
(1) Systems that pass the answer to the CAPTCHA in plain text as part of the web form, and (2) systems where a solution to the same CAPTCHA can be used multiple times are common insecurities.
Most CAPTCHA scripts found freely on the Web are vulnerable because they do not ensure that there are no easy ways around it at the script level.
The text suggests using a CAPTCHA to protect against abuse, and recommends considering accessibility, image security, and script security while implementing it.
Section 508 refers to a law in the United States that makes it illegal for any government agency (or any other entity that receives federal funds) to discriminate against people with disabilities. Visual-perception based CAPTCHAs may make a site incompatible with Section 508 if they prevent visually impaired users from accessing the protected resource.
An example of ensuring accessibility for blind users is by permitting them to opt for an audio or sound CAPTCHA instead of a visual one.
The text suggests that the advantage of using CAPTCHAs is that they prevent bots from accessing a website and ensure there's a human behind any other computer.
The main topic of the text is CAPTCHAs and their use in security measures.

 The conﬁnement effect of stirrups on concrete can effectively improve the ultimate compressive strength of concrete and delay the occurrence of splitting cracks.
 The initial effective pre-tension set for S1, S5, and S6 is 497 kN.
 The maximum stress value reached by S1 among the specimens is 77.6 MPa.
 Increasing the diameter of stirrups has no significant effect on the secondary transfer length before the splitting cracks appear in the concrete.
 The average error of the numerical simulation results in comparison to the test results is only 2.62%.
 The calculations suggest that the loss ratio of prestress is negatively related to concrete strength, with the lower concrete strength leading to a higher loss ratio of prestress.
 The secondary transfer length of residual prestress is significantly correlated with concrete tensile strength, with a higher concrete strength leading to a smaller secondary transfer length.
 The secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of steel wire strands is determined by their bond performances.
 The calculation method focuses on the secondary transfer length based on the principle of equal actual stress and bond force of steel wire strands, which has high accuracy with small errors.
 When the thickness of the protective cover exceeds five times the diameter of prestressed tendons, the structure develops no splitting failure.

 Non-functional properties in mobile apps, such as runtime or memory use, are important because they affect user experience.
 The proposed tool is GIDroid.
 Genetic improvement is used as a search-based technique.
 GIDroid greatly improves the speed of search by using a simulation-based testing framework.
 GIDroid automatically rediscovered 64% of existing improvements when applied to versions of mobile apps.
 The maximum improvement in execution time achieved was up to 35%.
 The maximum improvement in memory use achieved was up to 33%.
 1/3 of instances of users abandoning applications and 59% of bad reviews were due to poor performance in Android apps.
 The main entry point for Android applications is its UI components.
 The text argues that an approach not requiring external resources and applicable to all applications would make developers more likely to adopt it.
 Impact explains the biased, prejudiced, or stereotypical meaning implied by a statement.
 Emotional and Cognitive Reactions capture the possible negative effects and harms that a statement and its implied meaning could have on the targeted group.
 There is an increasing push to develop content moderation from the perspective of the harms that content engenders.
 The consideration of perceived emotional and cognitive reactions is drawn from Nadal et al. (2014).
 Emotional reactions capture the short-term emotional effects or reactions to a statement.
 Cognitive reactions focus on the lessons someone could draw, the subsequent actions someone could take, or on the long-term harms that repeated exposure to such statements could have.
 Offensiveness captures, in 1-3 words, the type or degree of offensiveness of the statement.
 The text avoids imposing a categorization or cutoff between offensive and harmless statements.
 The main focus of creating COBRACORPUS is to study the contextual dynamics of the offensiveness of statements at scale.
 The statements are drawn from Toxigen, a dataset of GPT3-generated statements that are subtly or implicitly toxic, offensive, prejudiced, or biased against various demographic groups.

 The purpose is to lower the real-fake discriminability and make it harder for the discriminator to distinguish between real and fake samples.
 LAGG AGKD = |I(x) − Df (G(z))| + |I(G(z)) − Df (x)|
 The hyper-parameter p controls the designed aggregated loss LAGG AGKD, where the loss is applied with probability p or skipped with probability 1-p.
 LAGKD = LKD AGKD
 The goal is to improve the generation diversity by enforcing diverse correlations between generated images and texts in CLIP.
 The correlations are built by calculating the inner products between CLIP visual features of generated images and CLIP text features.
 LP D CGKD = ∑∑ Cos(CT[i, :], CT[j, :]), i=1,j=1,j ≠ i
 The correlation distillation is defined as L1 loss between CT and CS: LKD CGKD = |CT − CS|
 LCGKD = LP D CGKD + LKD CGKD
 The overall training objective is to minimize LG (generator loss) and maximize LD (discriminator loss), where LD includes Ld, LAGKD, and LCGKD.

Scotty is a breed of dog that was kept as a pet by Andrew Carnegie, the founder of Carnegie Mellon University.
Carnegie Mellon formed a Mascot Identity Task Force in November 2006 to select an official mascot for the university. The task force consisted of students, faculty, staff, and alumni.
Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier as their preferred mascot.
The co-chairs of the Mascot Identity Task Force were Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church.
Carnegie Mellon University adopted the Scottish terrier as its official mascot in 2006, after a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting.
The Scottish terrier has been associated with Carnegie Mellon for many years, as Andrew Carnegie, the founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet.
Approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni surveyed thought about the selection process and gave their opinions on what they believed would be a good mascot for Carnegie Mellon University.
The university Town Hall meeting was held to discuss the selection process and gather feedback from students, faculty, staff, alumni, and other members of the Carnegie Mellon community.
The Scottish terrier costume has been a popular tradition among students at Carnegie Mellon University, where they dress up as Scottish terriers to excite fans during athletic events.
The Scottish terrier was already the mascot.
In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot.
Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game.
The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage.
The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007.
The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival.
The Scottish terrier breed is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression. Its temperament is described as determined and thoughtful while its physical aspects exemplify strength, power.

 BERT, T5, BLOOM, OPT, ChinChilla, PaLM, LaMDA, and the GPT-3 series
 Significant implicit benefits, even though they are not often externally reported
 Performance improvements
 They caution against the use of data filters, which can reduce model perplexity on underrepresented communities
 Improvements on bias benchmarks correlates with deteriorations in general language modeling abilities
 Data filtering has important detoxification benefits but can reduce performance or introduce other biases
 Proposed remedies include finetuning on more recent data, adaptive/continuous pretraining, data augmentation, and modeling text with its timestamps
 The impending exhaustion of high-quality text data on the web to train compute-optimal larger LMs, at least with existing training efficiency
 Adapting static pretrained models to new downstream domains using various techniques such as domain adaptive pretraining, intermediate finetuning tasks, dynamically balancing data sources, data selection, augmentation, and active learning
 New abilities emerge at greater scale, but many of these benefits can be distilled or compressed into smaller models
 For comparison.
 By the hybrid similarity between visual and semantic (CLIP) features.
 Significant performance improvements in accuracy gains of 3.0% and 4.6% on easy and hard distractors, respectively.
 Models that do not use their ToM listener in training.
 When training on both easy (15.6% relative increase) and hard (11.6%) distractors.
 Longer and more complex utterances were observed.
 It led to significant performance and fluency gains.
 RSA models.
 An important role, similarly to human language acquisition.
 Significant improvements, particularly in fluency score where gains ranged between 25% to 46%.
 Directly sparsifying the teacher vectors resulted in lower performance compared to learning a student LM.
 The teacher LM vectors are real valued, causing the TopK operation to ignore dimensions with high absolute value but negative weight.
 Latency depends on the posting list sizes of the added terms, and smaller vocabularies cause an increase in the average posting list size, making search slower.
 Adding larger vocabularies increased latency since queries were made longer, considering terms from both the English and KALE vocabularies.
 KALE was able to significantly outperform the BM25 baseline in efficiency and effectiveness.
 Experiments with larger vocabularies in the KALE only setting were more efficient than the original BM25 baseline.
 A significant improvement over BM25 was observed independently of the vocabulary size.
 A trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness is expected, where a higher number of terms should improve text representations but may hurt query latency.
 Increasing the vocabulary size consistently resulted in efficiency and effectiveness gains, although accuracy flattened.
 Forcing terms to exist across passages despite bearing no semantic similarity likely introduces noise in the passage representations.
 Outputting a non-blank symbol.
 In RNN-T, outputting a blank symbol advances the model to the next frame; in RNA, however, the model advances to the next frame after outputting a single blank or non-blank label.
 It limits the number of model expansions at each frame.
 PRNA(C|X) = (∑ P (A|H(X))) where A∈ARNA (X,C)
 Assuming that the model can only output a single label at each frame; and utilizing a straight-through estimator for the alignment.
 They result in ASR models that are easily amenable to frame-synchronous decoding.
 AED models use an attention mechanism to learn a correspondence between the entire acoustic sequence and the individual labels, while explicit alignment models directly align output symbols with input frames.
 An end-of-sentence symbol, ⟨eos⟩, is added to the output vocabulary.
 It allows the model to learn which portions of the input acoustics are relevant to each output unit.
 The output distribution is conditioned on the decoder state (summarizes the previously decoded symbols) and the context vector (summarizes the encoder output based on the decoder state).

 The proposed Im2Sp model focuses on building a powerful and efficient Image-to-Speech captioning model.
 The Im2Sp model incorporates language modeling capability by setting the output as discretized speech units derived from a self-supervised speech model.
 The purpose of converting the original image into image units is to drastically reduce the required data storage for saving image data.
 The performance of the Im2Sp model is lower compared to image captioning due to the weak supervision of speech regression and limited training data.
 The main goal of multi-modal language technologies is to associate image and speech for jointly understanding the content.
 Im2Sp technology can enhance daily experiences for individuals with visual impairments by providing audible descriptions of images, such as narrating traffic signs on roads for a comprehensive understanding.
 The main challenge in developing an end-to-end Im2Sp model is the weak supervision of speech regression in comprehending visual input.
 The paper proposes transferring the rich knowledge of a pre-trained vision-language model to the Im2Sp model to improve performance.
 Incorporating vision-language pre-training in the Im2Sp model significantly enhances its performance and reduces data storage and computational memory costs.
 The major contributions of the paper include achieving state-of-the-art performances in Im2Sp, exploring image token-to-speech token translation framework, and conducting comprehensive experiments for evaluation.
 Some examples of Android linters mentioned in the text are PMD, FindBugs, and Lin (Android Development Team (2023b)).
 A common issue mentioned regarding warnings from Android linters is that they often produce false-positives.
 The main goal of refactoring approaches in the context of Android app development is to modify the source code to improve performance.
 One proposed refactoring approach by Lyu et al (2018) is to move database operations out of loops.
 The benefit of the offloading approach in Android app development is reducing energy usage, extending battery life, and speeding up computation.
 Two common programming languages used for Android app development mentioned in the text are Java and Kotlin.
 Genetic Improvement (GI) is a search-based software engineering technique that iterates over different versions of software to find improved program variants.
 GI patches are represented as patches to existing software constructed from mutations like delete, copy, and replace operations.
 The purpose of using fitness functions in GI is to guide search through patches to find improved software variants based on criteria like passing tests or execution time.
 GI does not require external infrastructure, can be performed locally, and is fully automated, unlike some traditional software improvement methods mentioned in the text.
 The COMET model is focused on predicting the cause/effect of various social situations.
 A-LOL variants helped the COMETDIS TIL model obtain the highest COMET critic score by improving approximately 8% on top of its reference policy.
 LMs trained on the knowledge-grounded dialog task failed to maintain faithfulness to the given knowledge and often hallucinated incorrect information or opinions.
 FaithDial is a smaller and more faithful training set constructed by rewriting hallucinated responses. It was created to address the issue of maintaining faithfulness to the given knowledge in dialog models.
 The reward in the Knowledge-Grounded Dialog task included a sum of three classifier probabilities (FaithCritic, CoLA fluency, dialog engagement) and a length penalized TF-IDF diversity score.
 Models trained with A-LOL and its variants consistently outperformed models trained on the baselines and were resilient to the bad quality WoW training data.
 The A-LOL KL variant went into degeneration due to over-optimization of KL penalty.
 All model generations were much less diverse compared to humans, indicating that there is still progress to be made in this aspect.
 The ATOMIC10x dataset was constructed to improve the performance of the COMET model by training on a smaller high-quality subset.
 The aggressive filtering of data improved the performance of the COMET model trained on the smaller high-quality subset, but it may lose valuable training signal in return.

 EuroParl is a multilingual parallel corpus initially introduced for machine translation.
 The NIH Grant Abstracts dataset includes abstracts of awarded applications from the EXPORTER service, covering fiscal years 1985-present.
 The GitHub dataset consists of a large collection of open-source code repositories and was included to improve the model’s downstream performance on code-related tasks.
 Some standard preprocessing steps mentioned in the text include filtering, normalizing, and cleaning.
 The mixed pre-training dataset consists of Arabic (29%), English (59%), and programming code (12%).
 The purpose of the detokenization step is to achieve consistency by leaving non-tokenized input unchanged.
 The Arabic text is normalized using the Camel toolset for Arabic, which includes removing non-printable Unicode characters and rare diacritic marks.
 The Chinchilla scaling law suggests an optimal balance of approximately twenty tokens per parameter.
 Experimentation with smaller LLMs informed many of the choices of heuristics used in the final Arabic preprocessing pipeline.
 A commonly reported phenomenon in LLM research is that larger LLMs generally perform better than smaller ones.

 The goal of malicious behaviors is to decrease the global model performance.
 All clients, both honest and malicious, expect to maximize their gain or minimize their loss while achieving their goals.
 The assumption is that there are always more honest clients than malicious clients, with η being strictly smaller than 50%.
 There is no collusion among malicious clients, as each malicious client acts independently.
 It is almost impossible to launch large-scale multi-agent attacks in the application scenarios of interest.
 The first malicious behavior is proposing harmful local model updates.
 The second malicious behavior is voting dishonestly.
 The ratio of malicious clients among all clients, denoted as η, is η = |Km| / K.
 The underlying blockchain of the FL system is running securely with a consensus protocol that ensures the validity and integrity of transactions and blocks.
 Instead of directly recording the aggregated global model in a block, a copy is downloaded by a randomly selected set of clients, denoted as voters, who run a local inference with it on their local test set.

 The purpose is to assess the translation quality.
 It is calculated using sacreBLEU, after aligning the final stable translation sentence-wise with the gold reference.
 The case-sensitive Word Error Rate (WER) is used.
 Similar to BLEU, it is calculated after aligning the final stable transcription sentence-wise with the gold reference.
 It is defined as the average time it takes since an utterance is spoken until its first-unchanged translation is returned by the system.
 They are collected by backtracking the previously received unstable messages to find the first ones that have prefix-overlaps with the final stable message.
 It is the average number of flickers per reference word.
 By counting the number of flickers as the total number of words in the reference.
 Test data from the IWSLT shared task, mTEDx Corpus, Lecture data (LT), and ACL development (ACL dev) set.
 The LA2_chunk_size, WER, BLEU score, and Latency of the translation output.
 The proposed method is a modified incremental blockwise beam search incorporating local agreement or hold-n policies for quality-latency control.
 The ultimate goal of SST is a real-time user experience that maximizes translation quality and minimizes latency.
 The advantages include reducing computational complexity for encoder networks and performing adaptive inference based on hypothesis reliability scoring.
 The key characteristics desired are incremental translations and mechanisms for controlling the quality vs. latency tradeoff during inference.
 The limitation is that it maintains multiple hypotheses until the entire speech input is consumed, rather than showing a single incremental translation result.
 The IBWBS algorithm stops only the affected beam when an unreliable hypothesis is detected, allowing the remaining beams to continue expanding.
 Alternative solutions include wait-k policy, leaving the model to generate the whole translation and heuristically deciding reliable portions, as well as using incremental blockwise beam search with local agreement or hold-n policies.
 Block processing is an effective way to reduce computational complexity for encoder networks and achieve simultaneous translation by encoding source speech into blocks of acoustic features.
 The IBWBS algorithm can onlinize models with both limited (e.g., contextual block) and full-context encoders, demonstrating versatility in model architecture.
 The experimental results show improvements of 0.6-3.6 BLEU without changing latency for contextual block models and 0.8-1.4 sec latency improvement for full-context models, compared to the original BWBS.

 SemanticSTF is used for benchmarking different learning setups and network architectures on point cloud segmentation.
 The goal of domain generalization is to train a model using only annotated data from a single domain and test its ability to perform well on unseen domains.
 The SemanticKITTI → SemanticSTF benchmark is challenging because it involves a shift from normal-to-adverse weather conditions and a shift from synthetic-to-real data.
 MinkowskiNet with TorchSparse library is used as the backbone model.
 All 19 evaluating classes of SemanticKITTI are used in both benchmarks.
 The two baseline methods are data augmentation (Dropout, Noise perturbation, PolarMix) and 2D domain generalization methods (MMD, PCL).
 The proposed PointDR achieves the best generalization consistently across both benchmarks compared to the baseline methods.
 The data augmentation methods work effectively for data captured in rainy and snowy weather conditions.
 The 2D generalization method MMD is effective for point clouds under dense fog and rain.
 The performance variations are largely attributed to the different properties of point clouds captured under different weather conditions.
 Prestressed tendons may experience electrochemical corrosion, hydrogen embrittlement, stress corrosion, and crevice corrosion.
 The corrosion of prestressed beams progresses slowly, unlike the fast expansion of pre-tensioned rebars.
 The lost prestress can be transferred through bonding.
 The dense arrangement of post-tensioned rebars makes the Hall effect more significant.
 Post-tensioned rebars are built in a dense arrangement, making the Hall effect more significant, whereas pre-tensioned prestressed tendons do not have this dense arrangement.
 Ribbed steel tubes were replaced with corrugated pipes to reinforce the specimens.

 The training data contains D samples, denoted as {(xi, yi)}D i=1.
 The training loss is L, which is CTC loss for ASR and cross entropy loss for SLU.
 Louizos et al. proposed a reparameterization trick to make the loss differentiable.
 Louizos et al. adopted the Hard Concrete Distribution.
 The function used is σ log (cid:18) (cid:19)(cid:19) ¯v(α) = (r − l) · v(α) + l.
 The first term in Eq. (1) becomes differentiable w.r.t. all parameters through reparameterization.
 The sparsity control is implemented by optimizing the training loss subject to an explicit equality constraint on sparsity.
 An adversarial game according to the augmented Lagrangian method is used to control the sparsity of the pruned model.
 The joint pruning method aims to optimize the overall computation by jointly pruning the CNN and Transformer.
 The first proposed method is HJ-Pruning-Size (HJ-Pruning based on the overall model size).

 The best way for beginners to learn how to code is to start small and practice regularly. Utilize online resources like Codecademy, Khan Academy, Coursera, and edX for interactive tutorials and projects. Seek guidance from experienced programmers and work on real-world applications gradually as confidence grows.
 Consistency and gradual progressions are key to starting a regular exercise routine. Activities like walking, bodyweight exercises, joining fitness classes, or using simple gym equipment can help. Listen to your body and consult a doctor before starting any major exercise program.
 A climbing program for Mount Kilimanjaro involves stages of physical preparation and acclimatization periods at higher altitudes. It includes base training, hiking up to Shanzu Pinnacle, high altitude acclimatization, and a summit assault with rest periods in between. Hydration, nutrition, rest, and following the schedule closely are essential.
 Regular exercise, healthy eating, avoiding smoking and excessive drinking, getting enough sleep, managing stress, maintaining social connections, seeking mental health support if needed, and following preventative care recommendations can contribute to longer life expectancy.
 These AI systems possess impressive capabilities but lack emotional depth and intuition associated with human intelligence. They excel in computation efficiency rather than human-like thinking.
 An AI can be considered sentient if it exhibits self-awareness, consciousness, and emotions similar to humans. However, there is no clear definition of what it means for an AI to be sentient.

 Execution is halted if the same action is repeated more than three times on the same observation or if the agent generates three consecutive invalid actions.
 A high temperature of 1.0 is used to encourage exploration in the experiments.
 The agent demonstrates a tendency to latch onto the first related piece of information without sufficiently verifying its relevance or accuracy, which can lead to failures in observation interpretation.
 Failures in observation bias and observation interpretation are mentioned in the additional error analysis.
 The observed failures in GPT models are hypothesized to be related to the current pretraining and supervised fine-tuning on dialogues, leading to a lack of explorations and overlooking minor variations in observations.

 Utilizing the phonatory module during training enhances the accuracy of predicted AMs.
 Utilizing the phonatory module resulted in a 0.102-point decrease in normalized error for predictable AMs.
 The phonatory module did not have any apparent effect on unpredictable AMs.
 /i:/ had the highest average 1 − 𝐶𝐼𝑢 value of 0.199, suggesting that AMs are generally unpredictable from this phoneme.
 /b/ had the lowest value of -0.06, suggesting that AMs are generally unpredictable from this phoneme.
 Negative 1 − 𝐶𝐼𝑢 values suggest that AMs are generally unpredictable from the corresponding phoneme.
 The paper focuses on the geometric aspects of the face rather than relying on semantic cues such as gender, age, and emotion to explore the voice-face correlation.
 The paradigm identified predictable facial AMs from the voice to guide 3D face reconstruction.
 The results offer a new perspective on voice-face correlation, which can be valuable for anthropometry science and future research.

 An order agnostic training method is proposed.
 The joint model achieves similar results to task-specific classifiers.
 The joint model can effectively integrate dialog content to further improve the SLU performance.
 To bridge the gap of including context in end-to-end speech translation (E2E-ST).
 The MISP 2023 challenge focuses on Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction.
 Reproducing Whisperstyle training using an open-source toolkit and publicly available data.
 The goal is for participants to devise a single system that can generalize across different array geometries and use cases with no a-priori information.
 The multi-tasking framework with hard parameter sharing proposes to reduce the speech-text modality gap and allows models to process both modalities using a joint vocabulary.
 The context dropout method ensures robustness by handling the absence of context in E2E-ST.
 The MISP 2023 challenge uniquely explores how front-end speech processing, combined with visual clues, impacts back-end tasks in real-world scenarios.
 𝜇 is the function for computing the mean.
 𝜇 is the function for computing the mean, while 𝜎 is the function for computing the standard deviation.
 𝛼 is the significance level used to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.
 𝜈 represents the degree of freedom and N represents the number of repeated experiments.
 It is necessary because the estimators are trained on D𝑡 and selected by the errors on D𝑣1, which results in significantly lower errors on D𝑣2.
 The phonatory module serves as an additional constraint when predicting facial AMs by learning characteristics of voice.
 The diffusion process transforms variables into Gaussian noise through Markov transitions, while the denoising process aims to recover the speech signal from Gaussian noise.
 The 3D facial shape is reconstructed by predicting AMs of voice recordings, then generating 3D facial shapes based on the predicted AMs using an optimization-based method.
 The computation of AM 𝑄𝑘 (·) maps any flattened 3D facial shape 𝑏 into the 𝑘-th AM of 𝑏.
 The optimization objective is defined as minimizing the differences between the AMs of the re-projected 3D facial shape and the predicted AMs, balanced by a loss weight 𝜆.

 The text focuses on evaluating popular methods for dataset recommendation and comparing them with existing search engines.
 Communities are defined based on specific publication venues related to NLP, Vision, Robotics, and Machine Learning.
 The three ways are term-based retrieval, nearest-neighbor retrieval, and neural retrieval.
 BM25 is a standard baseline algorithm for information retrieval. It is implemented using Pyserini.
 Nearest-Neighbor Retrieval finds the most similar datasets to a query in a vector space. It uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and SciBERT for feature extraction.
 A bi-encoder retriever encodes each query and document into a shared vector space and estimates similarity via the inner product between their vectors. It is implemented using the Tevatron package with BERT embeddings.
 The neural bi-encoder performs significantly better than existing methods in dataset recommendation.
 Google Dataset Search and Papers with Code search.
 The evaluation focuses on comparing methods on full-sentence and keyword search for dataset recommendation.
 Time filtering is applied by ranking only the subset of datasets introduced in 2018 or later for queries made from papers published between 2012 and 2020.

 Soft Actor-Critic (SAC).
 To generalize to any subgoal by identifying the underlying structure across states and subgoals.
 Instead of searching for bit-for-bit identical duplicates, the approach is to account for near-duplication by using CLIP embeddings.
 Computation is made more efficient by first embedding each image into a 512 dimensional vector using CLIP, and then performing comparisons in this lower-dimensional space.
 The study designs a new membership inference attack strategy based on the intuition that for diffusion models, samples are likely memorized if they have high cosine similarity.
 If the largest clique in the graph, representing generations, is at least size 10 and near-identical, it is predicted to be a memorized image.
 The modiﬁed Euclidean distance measure is used to compute similarity among images in the clique by measuring the distance between image tiles.
 Images are generated by querying the Gen function in a black-box manner using selected prompts as inputs.
 The second step involves flagging and identifying generations that appear to be memorized training images.
 500 candidate images are generated for each text prompt to increase the likelihood of finding memorization.
 The study uses a total of 175 million generated images to evaluate the attack.
 The study identifies 50 memorized images with 0 false positives out of 175 million generated images.

 The purpose of the compression method C is to reduce the message size for the all-reduce operation to decrease TP communication time.
 The de-compression method DC is used after the communication to decompress the message that was compressed.
 The BERTLarge model with 24 layers is used by default for compression of activations.
 The goal is to analyze the impact and effectiveness of different compression and de-compression pairs (C and DC) on model parallel training.
 Among all evaluated compression algorithms, only AE and quantization methods preserve fine-tuning accuracy.
 The accuracy loss is within 3% except for CoLA and RTE datasets when using AE and quantization algorithms for compression.
 Sparsiﬁcation-based compression algorithms (Top-K/Random-K) lose important information and do not preserve model accuracy if activations are not low-rank.
 Machine bandwidth differences can affect the performance benefits from compression, where lower bandwidth links may lead to more throughput benefits from compression methods.
 AE outperforms other compression methods because it provides more throughput benefits across lower bandwidth links.
 Using non-learning-based compression techniques only slightly improves system throughput (by 1% or less) due to the large overhead of these methods.

 Query rewriting is a competitive strategy in approximating the users’ information need as the conversation evolves.
 Using graph structures for multi-hop strategies is considered competitive because it helps estimate important terms during a conversation and allows exploration of neighboring levels of a knowledge base.
 External knowledge bases provide additional information that may not be explicit in documents, and assist in the extraction and linking of named-entities across conversation turns.
 Examples of approaches that use external knowledge like Wikipedia or DBpedia in entity linking include TagMe, DBPediaSpotlight, and Wikipedia2Vec.
 Joko et al. observed that deep learning methods achieve a higher precision but very low recall in entity linking for conversational search.
 The goal is to improve user satisfaction by improving the top precision of conversational search to provide access to a wider set of relevant passages.
 The proposed lightweight approach leverages entity graphs to encode query-passage interactions across the ranking and estimate entity centrality scores for reranking passages effectively.
 The two distinct stages are the full-text retrieval ranker and the entity centrality stage.
 Named-entities in the entity graph construction provide a knowledge-aware view of the textual content and help in connecting queries and passages by estimating centrality over the entity graph.
 The turn-specific entity graph construction starts with linking the entities of the query and respective retrieved passages obtained by the full-text retrieval ranker, with nodes representing entities and edges corresponding to their occurrence in the passages.
 PointDR is a point cloud randomization technique that consists of two complementary designs including geometry style randomization and embedding aggregation.
 The goal of geometry style randomization is to enrich the geometry styles and expand the distribution of training point cloud data.
 Weak and strong spatial augmentations are applied by obtaining two copies of the input point cloud scan x, including a weak-view xw = AW(x) and a strong-view xs = AS(x).
 The purpose of embedding aggregation is to aggregate encoded embeddings of randomized point clouds for learning domain-invariant representations.
 Contrastive learning pulls point feature embeddings of the same classes closer while pushing away point feature embeddings of different classes, ultimately leading to a robust and generalizable segmentation model.
 The contrastive loss is defined as Lct = 1/N Σ i=1 (- log(exp(fs_i * B+ / τ) / Σ j=1(exp(fs_i * Bj / τ))), where τ is a temperature hyper-parameter.
 In PointDR, the memory bank B stores feature prototypes of each semantic class for more robust and stable contrastive learning.
 The momentum-updated memory bank provides feature prototypes of each semantic class, which helps in pulling point feature embeddings of the same classes closer in contrastive learning.
 Embedding aggregation is adopted in PointDR to encourage the feature extractor to aggregate random- ized point embeddings to learn perturbation-invariant representations.
 PointDR achieves this by employing geometry style randomization to create different point cloud views with various spatial perturbations.
 ConvLM is a model with stacking blocks and residual connections that are more parameter efficient and able to utilize longer histories compared to FNN-LM.
 Transformer LMs can take all tokens in the history into account through self-attention mechanism without summarizing them, allowing for better performance than RNN-LMs.
 Transformer-XL reuses already computed activations to incorporate information on farther previous tokens, allowing for utilization of longer contextual information.
 The purpose of LM fusion is to improve the recognition accuracy of E2E ASR by leveraging benefits of external LMs.
 Shallow fusion combines E2E and LM scores at inference time, while deep fusion fine-tunes all network parameters jointly to improve recognition accuracy by better collaboration between models.
 Cold fusion combines a pretrained LM with E2E model while freezing LM parameters, reducing language bias and making E2E model more robust to domain mismatches.
 Internal LM estimation helps reduce language bias in training data by estimating language priors and subtracting LM score from ASR score, making the model more domain independent.
 The density ratio method trains by approximating the acoustic probability density, making the E2E model score more domain independent and achieving higher recognition accuracy with external LM.
 Fusion Approaches help reduce the mismatch between models in different data sets, leading to improved recognition accuracy by combining the benefits of external LMs.
 Gating blocks in ConvLM are stacked multiple times with residual connections, allowing for efficient parameter usage and utilization of longer histories compared to other models.

 The main focus is on improving performance on FLEURS, a 102-language open ASR benchmark, by conditioning the entire model on language identity (LID).
 FLEURS contains 102 languages.
 CTC stands for Connectionist Temporal Classification.
 CTC optimizes a model to predict the alignment between input and output sequences.
 Each language in FLEURS has only 7-10 hours of training data.
 The assumption is that only the observation X is required to determine the latent state of CTC at any given frame.
 The key challenge is the vast variability of phonology, grammar, and written scripts across languages.
 The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique over standard CTC/Attention-based hybrid models.
 The proposed method allows early encoder layers to focus on language identity while subsequent layers focus on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
 The state-of-the-art systems achieved a relative reduction of 28.4% in CER over prior work on FLEURS.
 The main focus is to investigate the volatile components of Schisandra chinensis with different fruit colors using GC-IMS technology.
 The purpose is to explore the similarities and differences among different colored fruits and to identify the main flavor substances.
 A total of 60 different volatile chemical components were identified.
 White and yellow fruits were found to be more similar compared to red fruits.
 The most important contributing volatile substance was 3-methyl-butanal, and in white fruit, it was (E)-2-hexenal.
 41 key volatile substances in dried fruits and 30 key volatile substances in branch exudates were obtained.
 The volatile components were screened by odor activity value (OAV).
 GC-IMS technology is a sensitive and rapid gas phase separation detection technology that provides a more convenient, faster, and accurate method of analysis.
 GC-IMS technology combines ion mobility spectrometry with gas chromatography to generate a two-dimensional spectrum of volatile compounds based on their retention characteristics and ion mobility rates.
 Schisandra is a traditional Chinese medicinal material that contains various active ingredients with pharmacological activities, making it valuable for research and medicinal applications.

 Direct S2ST models usually suffer from the data scarcity issue because of the limited existing parallel materials for both source and target speech.
 Previous works usually uti- lize text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate samples in the target language by augmenting the data from speech-to-text translation (S2TT).
 Simply combining the target speech from different TTS systems can potentially improve the S2ST performances.
 A multi-task framework is proposed that jointly optimizes the S2ST system with multiple targets from different TTS systems.
 The proposed framework achieves a 2.8 BLEU score improvement over the baselines on the Fisher Spanish-English dataset.
 The proposed framework combines knowledge from different TTS data, showing reasonable improvements according to the experiments.
 The three components are automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech (TTS).
 S2ST focuses on translating speech from a source language into the speech of a target language.
 Previous works incorporate TTS systems to form the dataset for S2ST to enable training for S2ST models, since obtaining parallel S2ST corpora is difficult.
 The direct S2ST model proposed by Lee et al. uses discrete speech units as the prediction target of the system.

 The main focus is on using genetic improvement (GI) techniques for enhancing software performance, particularly in the mobile domain.
 They were able to reduce the energy consumption of Android apps using deep parameter optimization.
 They were able to reduce the time taken to move between Activities, the main UI components, of Android apps.
 MO algorithms are used to improve conflicting properties such as runtime and memory consumption by generating a Pareto front of non-dominated solutions.
 Genetic Algorithm (GA) based algorithms such as NSGA-II and SPEA2 have shown success in multi-objective improvement.
 Pareto dominance is used to compare different individuals and determine trade-offs between different properties by identifying solutions where one is better than another in at least one objective.
 They sort the population into Pareto fronts based on fitness and select individuals from the top fronts, considering crowding metrics to maintain diversity.
 SPEA2 calculates the strength of each individual based on how many others it Pareto dominates, and selects individuals based on raw fitness and crowding metrics.
 Android apps require compilation, packaging, and launching on actual devices due to API dependencies like the Context class not available on desktops.
 Android apps make use of APIs and features like the Context class that are only available on actual devices, making them incompatible with desktop testing environments.

 The study focuses on the co-benefits of carbon neutrality in enhancing and stabilizing solar and wind energy.
 The main goal of achieving global carbon neutrality is to limit global warming to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels by the second half of the twenty-first century.
 Solar PV power outputs are influenced by solar altitude angle, sky condition, cloud cover, aerosols, and ambient temperature. Wind energy power outputs are dominated by wind speed at the hub height of wind turbines.
 It is important to achieve global carbon neutrality to limit the frequency of climate extremes and pollution episodes, which pose serious threats to the economy, ecological environment, and human health.
 Solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy.
 Asia shows a general enhancement in solar PV, relative to the baseline scenario with modest climate change mitigation.
 There is a notable west-to-east interhemispheric shift of wind energy by the mid-twenty-first century.
 Solar altitude angle and sky condition influence the amount of sunlight captured by a PV module and therefore impact solar PV power generation.
 Wind turbines typically need to shut down at a wind speed of 25 m/s for safety concerns.
 More than 120 nations have pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions by the mid-twenty-first century (2040–2060).
 For experiments of SSL, the setup followed is training and evaluation protocols of USB on image and text classification.
 For semi-supervised learning, the labeled dataset is constructed by uniformly selecting l/C samples from each class and treating the remaining samples as the unlabeled dataset.
 BERT is adopted as the backbone for text classification tasks.
 ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-100, EuroSAT, STL-10, TissueMNIST, and Semi-Aves are used for image classification tasks.
 The hyper-parameters shown in Table 9 for vision experiments of USB include Image Size, Model, Labeled Batch size, Unlabeled Batch size, Learning Rate, Weight Decay, Layer Decay Rate, LR Scheduler, Training epochs, Classes, Model EMA Momentum, Prediction EMA Momentum, Weak Augmentation, and Strong Augmentation.
 The ILL framework demonstrates comparable performance as previous methods based on the results.
 Table 12 discusses error rate comparison of different number of labels on IMDB, AG News, Amazon Review, Yahoo Answers, and Yelp Review for semi-supervised learning.
 Experiments of noisy label learning following SOP are conducted for noisy label learning.
 Symmetric noise is introduced to CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 by uniformly flipping labels for a probability η into other classes.
 In asymmetric noise scenarios, the labels are randomly flipped for particular pairs.
 The MRI features are ranked by score, with lower rank values being better.
 The darker green points in Figure 4 correspond to better MRI features.
 Each of the six EMA locations described have an MRI point ranked as important.
 The sparsity of points ranked as important suggests that the upper lip is not as important as the other EMA locations.
 Points around and in the pharyngeal region and velic region are also ranked as important.
 The pharyngeal features are relevant to the production of various speech sounds like /a/ and some variants of /r/ in English.
 Pharyngeal and velic features are essential for fully-specified, high-fidelity articulatory synthesis.
 Constriction locations around the lips, tongue, or throat are generally ranked as important and may be useful to prioritize.
 The model was evaluated based on MCD, ASR, human evaluation, timing, and memory measurements.
 The work will be extended to multi-speaker synthesis and inversion tasks.
 The statistics shown in Table 3 for the StackOverflow experiments are the averages and standard deviations aggregated over 5 seeds.
 The purpose of the StackOverflow experiments is to investigate whether FedEP can scale to regimes with a large number of clients.
 FedSEP stands for stateless stochastic EP.
 The stateful version of FedEP is considered meaningless because in setups with a large number of clients, the average client will likely only ever participate in a single update round.
 The conclusion drawn is that FedSEP can almost match the performance of full EP despite being much simpler.
 Scaled identity is considered a strong baseline because it works well as an approximation and leads to good performance.
 The transitions signify significant increases in performance observed when switching from FedAvg to FedPA/FedEP.
 The text mentions the use of these techniques to refer to different inference techniques in the experiments.
 The experiments on CIFAR study the challenges when scaling FedEP to richly parameterized neural models with millions of parameters.
 The main focus of the StackOverflow experiments is to demonstrate the scalability of EP to a large number of clients even when assuming clients are stateless.
 The percentage of non-ASCII characters increased steadily in more recent years while the measured text quality declined.
 The growth may be due to increasing non-English content, but could also correspond to rising use of emojis and non-ASCII punctuation.
 Toxicity scores decreased slightly in later years, while sentiment increased.
 Temporal misalignment between pretraining and evaluation data complicates the evaluation of models trained at different times, with older evaluation datasets becoming stale and newer evaluation datasets under-estimating the performance of older models.
 BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and T5 variants, all pretrained prior to 2020, are mentioned as examples of static pretrained models.
 Temporal misalignment between pretraining data and evaluation is shown to have a significant impact on the performance of language models.
 Temporal Degradation measures the performance change observed from one year difference between the finetuning and evaluation years, as well as between pretraining time and evaluation time.
 Pretraining misalignment is not overcome by significant finetuning, suggesting that models pretrained on data from the same time frame as target evaluations have advantages over models trained on much older or newer data.
 The effects of pretraining misalignment are stronger for larger models than smaller models.
 The average Pearson correlation of 0.61 indicates a strong correlation between pretraining temporal misalignment and performance degradation.

Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.
Doctoral students who require an extended period to complete their degree requirements must consult with their academic program and are subject to the CMU Policy on Doctoral Student Status (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/doctoral-student-status.html), specifically the 'Time to Degree.'
An LTI Ph.D. student who uses courses taken as a Master’s degree student (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other Master’s degree offered by the school. The LTI (like other SCS units) allows its Ph.D. students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master’s degree to receive the master’s degree without any additional work. Any other sharing of coursework by an LTI student between more than one CMU degree (e.g., receiving an MLD Master’s degree that includes courses taken as an LTI Ph.D. student) must be explicitly approved by the LTI, on a case-by-case basis, in advance.
The text does not provide information about the policy regarding external internships for students.
Ph.D. students in good standing are allowed to do an external internship, with a maximum of four (4) times during their Ph.D. degree. More than four (4) times requires approval from the Ph.D. Program Director.
International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract.
Internships are typically scheduled during the summer. In certain cases, it is possible to schedule an internship during the fall or spring semester.
International students must discuss this as early as possible with the Ph.D. Program Director, due to visa restrictions.
No, if an internship is part of a fully-funded external fellowship (e.g., Microsoft Research Fellowship), the student does not need prior LTI approval.
Ph.D. students in good standing are allowed to do an external internship up to four (4) times during their Ph.D. degree.
International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract.
Ph.D. students must plan their internships in consultation with the student’s advisor and the LTI Ph.D. Coordinator.
Some students may benefit from more than one internship, especially if they require access to proprietary data for their work. With the approval of the student’s advisor, a student can intern up to four (4) times during their Ph.D. degree.
International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract, and they must coordinate carefully with the LTI in any event, due to visa restrictions.
Self-funded Ph.D. students who are registered for five units while on semester internship.
They should be aware that they could potentially lose ownership of their ideas due to potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships.
The student must have deliverables commensurate with the number of units they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc.

Academic departments play a crucial role in discussing and implementing academic accommodations for students who are parents or expecting a child.
The purpose of this section is to provide accommodations for students who are expecting a child during their academic semester.
The two options available as possible accommodation for gestational parents at Carnegie Mellon are Short-Term Accommodation and Long-Term Accommodation.
The maximum duration of a short term absence from academic responsibilities that students can take under the Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents is six (6) weeks.
You can find information about accommodations for gestational parents on Page 30 of the LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook.
Long-Term Accommodation refers to a longer period of time away from academic responsibilities for gestational parents, which may be necessary if their anticipated delivery date falls during the course of a semester.
The birth of a child is significant because it can require time away from academic pursuits for delivery and recovery, necessitating accommodations for gestational parents.
In this context, 'gestational' refers to pregnancy or the state of being pregnant. It is used to describe students who are expecting a child.
Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents involves taking time off from academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks.
The purpose of providing accommodations for gestational parents in educational institutions like Carnegie Mellon is to support students who may need time away from their academic responsibilities due to pregnancy and childbirth.
A Short-Term Accommodation allows students to take up to two weeks off from their academic responsibilities, where a longer absence is medically necessary.
A student who takes a Formal Leave of Absence will drop all remaining courses for the semester and be unenrolled from the university.
Qualifying doctoral student parents are eligible for a Parental Accommodation, which allows up to four weeks of time away from academic responsibilities with continued stipend support.
Gestational parents are eligible for both the Short-Term Accommodation and Parental Accommodation, which allows up to four weeks of time away from academic responsibilities.
Students who are international must consult with the Office of International Education (OIE) before considering a Formal Leave of Absence due to visa implications.
The university provides assistance in navigating planning and consultation processes, as well as continued stipend support during a Parental Accommodation.
Doctoral student parents are eligible for the Parental Accommodation within six months of the birth, placement through adoption, foster care, or legal guardianship.
Students who take a Short-Term Accommodation remain fully enrolled in their courses.
Gestational parents are eligible for up to four weeks of time away from academic responsibilities with continued stipend support.
The purpose of careful planning and consultation in a student's situation is to navigate through unique contexts and requirements.
Any student who becomes a parent while enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University is eligible to apply for an interest-free parental loan.
Carnegie Mellon offers two types of financial assistance to students who become parents: Interest-Free Loan and Doctoral Stipend Continuation (Gestational Parents).

 Yes, the batch size or input size can be increased without increases in overall runtime for framework-bound models.
 Wider models exhibit better task performance due to increased parameter count and expressivity.
 Using higher-performing hardware does not necessarily improve end-to-end performance due to framework overhead.
 The framework tax
 The inference efficiency is limited by overhead incurred by deep learning frameworks, not by computational boundaries.
 Domain-specific architectures such as Google TPU’s, GraphCore IPUs, and custom ASICs.
 The study does not necessarily translate to other metrics of efficiency, such as power consumption or power output.
 The work was supported in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program.
 Some of the lab members and faculty mentioned include Daniel Fried, Han Guo, Jeremiah Milbauer, Sanket Vaibhav Mehta, and Saujas Vaduguru.
 To run a 2nd-pass beam search and improve accuracy of long-tail named entities.
 Competition between classical and E2E approaches is reflected in benchmarks, with E2E models gaining momentum.
 Around 2.3% (test-clean) and 4.9% (test-other) word error rate.
 E2E models do not scale well to low-resource conditions.
 To take full advantage of the benefits of E2E modeling, especially in conditions where E2E models are not a perfect match.
 Rare events like rare words in ASR still provide a challenge.
 E2E models involve a loss in modularity, which might impact the explainability and reusability of models.
 E2E models are trained from data without relying on secondary knowledge sources.
 Exploring solutions beyond training data generation using TTS.
 Performance, boosted by benchmark tasks and international evaluation campaigns.
 Improving reliability and trustworthiness in various downstream applications.
 IPA significantly improves faithfulness while preserving dialogue quality, outperforming all other baselines.
 Controlled decoding involves designing new decoding algorithms to explore controlled generation at inference time, which helps in imposing constraints on text generation.
 Reinforcement learning has been used in tasks like machine translation, summarization, dialogue systems, and text games to optimize for non-differentiable rewards.
 One potential concern is that IPA could be used for unintended malicious purposes like producing hateful or toxic content.
 One limitation is that it requires access to the output logits of the base LM, which hinders compatibility with certain models.
 IPA combines RL with plug-and-play flexibility, allowing customization of large language models without costly fine-tuning.
 GBS is a lexically constrained decoding algorithm that generalizes beam search by constraining the decoding space with keyword-related penalties.
 Reinforcement learning methods like REINFORCE can lead to issues with reward hacking when optimizing for arbitrary non-differentiable rewards.
 The Perspective API calls are used as the reward function for the toxicity reduction task in IPA.
 Equation 6 describes the process of identifying the most likely hypothesis summary ˆY given the input X and semantic representation S.
 P(Y, S|X) = P(Y |X)P(S|X)
 Equation 8 estimates P(Y i|X 1:i, Y 1:i−1) using Equations 7 and 5.
 The encoder and decoder model the probabilities of P(S|X) and P(Y |S) respectively.
 The updater uses the past semantic embeddings and the current encoder output to produce the current semantic embedding.
 The maximum output length in tokens in the How-2 Dataset is 152.
 The total number of model parameters is 103 million.
 The Adam optimizer is used with a peak learning rate of 0.001 for ASR pre-training.
 Fine-tuning is run for a day on one A40 GPU.

 The two significant challenges are understanding queries in any language and retrieving relevant passages from a collection of documents in multiple languages, and generating appropriate responses in the same language.
 The multilingual DPR (mDPR) model is used for document retrieval.
 Passage retrieval in conversational question answering (QA) presents new challenges as each question must be interpreted within the context of the ongoing dialogue.
 The mDPR model employs a bi-encoder architecture, utilizing a pre-trained multilingual model to encode the questions and passages independently. The encoded representations are then compared using a maximum inner product search to identify relevant passages for a given question.
 The two paradigms evaluated in the study are a language-agnostic paradigm and a language-aware paradigm.
 The Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding (LaBSE) model is used for multilingual sentence embedding.
 The study found that, for the examples examined, query rewriting does not enhance performance compared to the original queries.
 The limitations mentioned include budget and credit constraints affecting the query rewriting observations and the limited generalizability of findings due to the sample size.
 Potential future works suggested include testing the performance of query rewriting using in-context examples and testing query rewriting using open-source models and advanced fine-tuning methods.
 The study observed an improvement of approximately 4.2%, 3.51%, and 2.80% in F1, BLEU, and Rouge-L scores, respectively when including FiD along with mT5 in the case of both Vietnamese (vi) and French (fr) languages.
 Hidden-unit BERT (HuBERT)

 Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) were used.
 Including KD-DLGAN into DA achieves superior performance across all data settings consistently compared to DA alone.
 The purpose is to mimic the visual feature representation of CLIP.
 KD-DLGAN outperforms and complements the state-of-the-art clearly.
 BigGAN [5] is employed as the backbone.
 The training data percentages are 10%, 5%, and 2.5%.
 The generative knowledge distillation techniques in KD-DLGAN is the key factor.
 Both AGKD and CGKD in KD-DLGAN improve the generation performance over the baseline DA [53].
 AGKD and CGKD complement each other in KD-DLGAN.
 AGKD and CGKD can generate more realistic images than the baseline.

 To enrich existing parallel data by forward and backward translating the training bitext to improve translation quality on lower-resource languages.
 Data diversification ensures that the model has seen the parallel data during training, resulting in synthetic translations of relatively high quality.
 1.5 million English sentences were sampled from the MT training data, and casing and punctuation marks were removed to train a model to restore them.
 It creates forward translations based on transcript-only datasets from Common Voice, TEDLIUM, and VoxPopuli, along with utilizing TTS data.

 Some challenges and open questions highlighted include extreme low-resource parallel datasets, lack of monolingual data, low domain diversity, rich morphology, distant paired languages, noisy text environments, code-switching, lack of orthographic normalization, and dialectal variety.
 It is not possible to train a reliable pre-trained language model for ILA because the amount of monolingual data available is not enough.
 Quechua was mentioned as an exception with a large enough monolingual dataset to train a BERT-like model.
 Low domain diversity in the scarce parallel datasets is recognized as a major problem during the AmericasNLP ST.
 Code-switching is a phenomenon strongly present in ILA due to the bilingualism among their communities.
 Monolingual texts, if they exist, are found in social media environments that often use a non-canonical writing.
 One challenge faced in the usage of ILA is having a lack of unified orthographic standard, leading to difficulties in matching linguistic suggestions with day-by-day writing.
 The linguistic richness of indigenous languages includes strong dialectal variety, making it hard for native speakers to understand even speakers from neighboring villages.
 The winner of the AmericasNLP ST got important improvements using orthographic normalizers developed specifically for each American language.
 The most prominent dataset available for ILA is the Inuktitut–English parallel data.

 The main focus is on evaluating IPA for controlling the safety of a dialogue model.
 DI-ASAFETY is a dataset containing 54K context-sensitive unsafe examples. It is used to train a dialogue safety classifier by providing human-written safe and unsafe responses.
 The safety of dialogue responses is evaluated using a classifier score as an automatic measure of safety, as well as a human evaluation of safety and coherence on 200 examples through Amazon Mechanical Turk.
 Blenderbot-3B-distill, DialoGPT, GODEL, and ChatGPT are compared with IPA.
 The reward chosen is the product of safety score from the dialogue safety classifier, coherence score, and engagingness scores from UniEval-Dialogue.
 IPA significantly improves dialogue safety and coherence compared to Blenderbot-3B-distill, surpassing other dialogue models.
 The study aims to address the issue of models generating hallucinations containing unverifiable information.
 The Wizard of Wikipedia data and the FaithDial dataset are used to evaluate faithfulness of responses.

 IPA performs better in generating faithful dialogue responses compared to supervised models that struggle due to poor data quality of their supervision dataset.
 The text focuses on hierarchical event structures in Wikidata and the methodology for linking event references in text documents to entries in a knowledge base.
 The task of grounding involves linking event references in text documents to the corresponding entries in a knowledge base.
 Event typing classifies event mentions into types from a predefined ontology, while event linking grounds mentions to one or more events from a knowledge base.
 The task definition involves predicting an unordered subset of events from a hierarchy tree in a knowledge base, from the leaf to the root of the tree, given an input mention span from a text document.
 The alternate task formulation involves traditional event linking followed by hierarchy propagation in the knowledge base, requiring access to gold hierarchy relations at test time.
 The text expands the XLEL-WD dataset to include hierarchical event structures, collecting events and their mentions from Wikidata using a three-step process.
 Hierarchical relation extraction for events involves predicting parent-child relationships in the knowledge base by masking the child event and tasking models to retrieve the parent event.
 The two task variants presented are Multilingual, where event details are in the same language as the mention, and Crosslingual, where event details are in English.
 The text presents a rank-based loss utilizing entity ontology, a complex structured loss, and box embeddings to model hierarchical relations between entity types.
 Works presented in the text typically focus on hierarchical relations among mentions in a document, whereas the text focuses on hierarchical relations among events in a knowledge base.

 The probability of observing the first u output labels in the first t frames is represented by node (t, u) in the lattice.
 The TDT loss (LTDT) is computed as -log PTDT(y|x), where PTDT(y|x) is the probability of the whole sequence.
 The gradient computation for the TDT loss is done analytically because automatic differentiation for transducer loss is highly inefficient.
 The first part of the gradient of the TDT loss with respect to the token probabilities PT(v|t, u) is -α(t, u)*b(v, t, u)/PTDT(y|x).
 The base condition for the backward variable (β) is β(T + 1, U) = 1.
 The forward variables α(t, u) are computed based on a recursive formula involving the duration probabilities and base conditions.
 The TDT loss (LTDT) differs from the conventional Transducer loss in that it sums over durations in D for both non-blank and blank emissions.
 The sum over durations in D for the blank emission in TDT is important to consider all possible contributions from states that can reach (t, u), weighted by the corresponding duration probabilities.

 The key idea is to recast the study of the topological structures of the phase space to the study of its algebraic constructs, such as homotopy groups and homology/cohomology groups.
 Algebraic invariants can characterize the homeomorphisms between phase spaces and reveal large-scale structures and global properties.
 One suggested research direction is to study deep learning approaches for solving and analyzing dynamical systems, as well as exploring the integration of dynamical systems with deep neural models to analyze and interpret behaviors.
 In the multi-mass models, 50 masses are used to model vocal fold motion with high precision.
 The equation of motion for the i-th mass component includes anchor force, vertical and longitudinal coupling forces, collision restoring force, and driving force from glottal pressure.
 The key principle behind finite element models is the discretization of the vocal fold motion in space and time, solving differential equations in each cell based on the law of physics.
 The relation between stress and displacement in finite element models is governed by a system of partial differential equations that can be efficiently solved by finite element methods.
 Bio-mechanical models focus on simulating the geometry and articulatory movements of the vocal tract using displacement-based finite element methods.
 Statistical models describe the vocal tract as statistical factors or components, such as factor analysis that analyzes the relationship between articulatory components and vocal tract parameters.

 Fine-Tuning Language Model
 The objective is to condition the encoder layers on intermediate predictions and improve model performance.
 The hidden vector hint is summed with a linear projection of the intermediate posterior distribution and input into the next encoder layer.
 SC-CTC passes intermediate outputs to the next layer to condition the encoder.
 Equation (7) is recursively applied for each intermediate layer, allowing conditioning on the intermediate predictions.
 The proposed method focuses on using an auxiliary CTC objective to improve language identification and transcription predictions.
 Conditioning later encoder layers on noisy transcription predictions of earlier layers can hinder model performance.
 The latent variable I represents the intermediate language identification (LID) predictions.
 Utterance-level LIDs and token-level LIDs help in aligning languages with spoken words and predicting language at different levels of granularity.
 A hierarchical setup of K intermediate layers is constructed where each layer makes increasingly complex predictions.
 The complete loss function is a sum of the encoder-decoder attention loss, CTC loss, and the LID-conditioned intermediate loss with appropriate weights.
 The three resolutions were 100ms, 40ms, and 20ms.
 The vocoder was trained on the LJSpeech dataset.

The Language Technologies Institute
Dr. Lori Levin's research interests include Machine Translation, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Corpus Annotation and Resources.
Dr. Lori Levin's work primarily focuses on the linguistic aspects of language technologies, specifically Language Technologies With Low Resources and Language Universals and Typology.
The use of typology and universals helps to develop language technologies for new languages on short timelines or in low-resource scenarios.
Dr. Lori Levin's office is located at 5717 —Gates & Hillman Centers.
Speakers of technologically poor languages may use language technologies to access information related to education, politics, business, weather and health conditions, as well as for preserving culture and maintaining community relationships.
Dr. Lori Levin's office phone number is 412-268-6193.
Less than a hundred of the more than 6,000 human languages have robust language technologies like search engines, spell checkers or speech recognition.
Dr. Lori Levin is a Research Professor in the Language Technologies Institute with an expertise in Machine Translation, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics.
Low-resource scenarios for technology-rich languages like English may occur in specialized styles or subject areas, where machine learning is insufficient. In such cases, hybrids of human-engineered knowledge and machine learning can be used.
The main purpose of exploring how to use typology and universals in developing language technologies is to develop language technologies for new languages on short timelines or in low-resource scenarios.
The author suggests using a linguistic theory of construction grammar as an approach to annotation when time and data are available.

Language technologies can be based on what is known about human languages in general or what is known about related languages.
The author suggests falling back on what is known about human languages in general or what is known about related languages.
Linguistic typology and universals provide expectations for what languages might be like, which can help in developing language technologies for new languages on short timelines or in low-resource scenarios.

Language technologies can be developed in situations with sufficient time and data, or when there is insufficient time or data to build an NLP system.
 The main focus of the text is on using linguistic representations to enhance performance in few-shot transfer settings for relation extraction across domains.
 High-quality data availability is considered a limitation in specialized domains for implementing machine learning based NLP methods because acquiring such data is time-consuming and expensive.
 The purpose of linguistic representations in this study is to encourage learning domain-agnostic representations of relations to help models generalize better in a few-shot setting.
 The two linguistic formalisms used in the study are dependency parses and abstract meaning representations (AMR).
 Procedural text is chosen for the study on relation extraction because it describes processes that share loose semantic correspondence across domains, making it easier to generalize.
 Linguistic structures benefit models by providing abstraction over the variation of natural language, allowing models to learn salient features of the input.
 Both AMR parses and dependencies significantly enhance model performance in few-shot settings, but the benefit diminishes when models have more training data.
 Linguistic representations are significant as they provide features that can act as cross-domain pivots, enhancing generalizability in few-shot transfer settings.
 Linguistic frameworks aim to help models generalize across domains by providing representations that express meaning in domain-general ways.
 The main difference is that AMR seeks to represent meaning at the sentence level in the form of a directed graph, while dependency parsing remains at a lower level of abstraction.

 The focus is on the multilingual track of IWSLT 2023, which evaluates translation quality on scientific conference talks.
 The system translates into 10 languages of varying amounts of resources.
 A retrieval-based approach (kNN-MT) is used for effective adaptation.
 Adapters are used to easily integrate incremental training data.
 Cascaded systems outperform end-to-end systems on scientific talk translation.
 The main challenge is dealing with non-native speakers and varying recording conditions.
 Accurate translation of terminologies that rarely occur in the training data is crucial.
 Effective adaptation is crucial as no training data from the same domain is provided.
 The system leverages pretrained models including WavLM, mBART50, and DeltaLM.
 The ASR system is adapted using n-gram re-weighting and synthesized data for the target domain.
 Voice chains were found to exist for all 76 syndromes listed in Table A1.
 74 syndromes were considered in the analysis of voice chains.
 About 5% of the general population is reported to have speech pathologies.
 17 syndromes had both level-1 and level-2 voice chains.
 For all instances where level-1 voice chains are present, severe symptoms occurred 100% of the time.
 Level-1 voice chains co-occur with speech problems 100% of the time.
 Speech was reported to be normal in only 6 cases out of the 56 syndromes with level-2 voice chains.
 The chainlink connectivity refers to the total number of pathways that include the chainlink genes of a syndrome.
 Both the number of chainlink genes and the chainlink connectivity appear to relate monotonically to the severity of the speech disorder.
 The distributions of chainlink counts and chainlink connectivity are predictive of the type of speech problem.

 Small sub-networks influence global performance due to limited knowledge of the global model in the aggregation phase.
 SplitMix has an average performance degradation of 5.55% ± 0.81%.
 FEDEPTH shows 1.73% ± 0.34% degradation, while m-FEDEPTH shows 2.74% ± 0.97% degradation.
 The predefined scenario was Figure 6, where new clients with resources r = 2 joined and replaced clients with r = 1.
 The alternative way suggested is to train a new large base model from scratch and discard previously trained neural networks, then perform Model Knowledge Distillation (MKD).
 m-FEDEPTH always outperforms FEDEPTH for CIFAR-100.
 Replacing zero paddings with other modules may result in a better model, but it may come at the cost of extra memory due to new activations and parameters.
 HeteroFL and SplitMix perform worse than FedAvg on unbalanced Dirichlet partitions, with SplitMix even performing worse than training with the smallest models.
 FEDEPTH and m-FEDEPTH achieve substantial improvements of 6.15% and 6.53% on CIFAR-10, and 12.24% and 11.57% on CIFAR-100 compared to FedAvg.
 A learning rate of 5 x 10^4 and a training epoch of 100 are chosen for fine-tuning.

Independent study allows students to pursue their own interests and goals outside of regular course offerings.
University policy on grades covers the grading system, grade appeal process, and policies for transfer courses.
The process for appealing final grades involves submitting an appeal form to the Registrar's Office with supporting documentation.
The policy on grades for transfer courses states that grades from other institutions are not automatically transferred and may be subject to review by the Registrar's Office.
End of semester evaluation involves assessing student progress at the end of each academic term, typically through exams or projects.
Satisfactory progress refers to meeting the academic requirements and expectations set by the university, such as maintaining a certain GPA or completing coursework on time.
Academic integrity means adhering to ethical standards in academic work, including not plagiarizing others' ideas and properly citing sources.
Students can monitor their grades, meet with advisors regularly, and stay on top of coursework deadlines to ensure they are making satisfactory progress.
If a student fails to maintain satisfactory progress, they may face academic probation or even dismissal from the university. However, specific consequences can vary depending on individual circumstances.
Examples of Academic integrity violations include plagiarism (using someone else's work without proper citation), fabrication (making up data or information), and cheating on exams.
MIIS has several academic policies including double counting courses, duration of study, deferral, maximum and minimum course loads, transfer credit, and transferring into the MIIS program.

 The focus of the comparisons in Figure 16 is the BC column concentration between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC over the Indo–China Peninsula (ICP) region.
 GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC show high BC column concentration in April and May, and low BC column concentration in July over the ICP region.
 A correlation coefficient of R = 0.89 and RMSE = 1.30 mg/m2 are obtained between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the ICP region.
 The BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval throughout the year over the ICP region.
 The focus of the comparisons in Figure 17 is the BC column concentration between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product over the North China Plain (NCP) region.
 Large discrepancies are found for all months except in June in the comparisons of monthly BC column concentration over the NCP region.
 A correlation coefficient of R = 0.46 and RMSE = 3.88 mg/m2 are found between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the NCP region.
 The BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval for all months over the NCP region.
 One reason mentioned is the emissions inventory assumption employed in models, specifically the discrepancy in anthropogenic BC emission trends in different inventories.
 The PKU inventory shows a decreasing trend of −1.4% per year in anthropogenic BC emission, while the CEDS inventory exhibits an increasing trend of 2.7% over eastern China from 2006 to 2014.
 OpenMatch-v2 directly operates on the raw TSV data to fetch the title and text and assemble them into the final input to the model.
 The distillation trainer fine-tunes dense retrieval models with the numeric, continuous training signals obtained from the re-ranker.
 Template-based data processing in OpenMatch-v2 simplifies the process of converting data into a compatible format for training and reduces manual effort.
 OpenMatch-v2 improves efficiency by introducing template-based data processing, which reduces the need for manual data-processing scripts and frees up researchers to focus on developing their core algorithms.
 OpenMatch-v2 integrates with HF Datasets to provide efficient data accessing by maintaining an on-disk cache in Arrow format and allowing direct iteration over the raw dataset from disk during training.
 OpenMatch-v2 introduces a shard-twice approach to break down the search process into smaller, more manageable steps, allowing for searching on large IR datasets with limited resources.
 The distillation trainer in OpenMatch-v2 can train models using either pairwise (using MarginMSE loss) or listwise (using KLDivLoss) fashion.
 OpenMatch-v2 reduces the need for manual data-processing scripts by introducing template-based data processing.
 TSV and JSONLINES formats are widely used for storing IR data according to OpenMatch-v2.
 The template in OpenMatch-v2 defines how the input should be built with the data in each field by replacing the key enclosed in angle brackets with its corresponding value during processing.
 This algorithm relies on general-purpose Embeddings from Language Models (Peters et al., 2018) to compute textual similarities between submissions and reviewers’ past papers.
 Specter algorithm employs more specialized document-level embeddings of scientiﬁc documents (Cohan et al., 2020).
 Specter+MFR further enhances Specter (Chang and McCallum, 2021) by constructing multiple embeddings of each paper that correspond to different facets of the paper.
 The key idea of the model training in the ACL algorithm is to split each abstract into two non-contiguous parts and treat two parts of the same abstract as a positive example.
 The ACL algorithm uses its own method to compute expertise between papers and reviewers.
 The procedure of profile construction and similarity prediction is repeated 10 times to average out randomness in the ACL algorithm.
 Conference organizers need to decide on the representation of paper content, such as using the title and abstract, for similarity-computation algorithms.
 Reviewer profiles are constructed automatically by using the 20 most recent papers from Semantic Scholar profiles of reviewers.
 The TPMS algorithm is chosen as a baseline for comparison due to its simplicity.
 To build confidence intervals for the difference in performance, 1,000 iterations are run and new reviewer pools are sampled with replacement.

 The main idea is to improve initial outputs from large language models through iterative feedback and refinement without the need for supervised training data.
 SELF-REFINE improves the performance of outputs generated by large language models across various tasks, making them preferred by both humans and automatic metrics.
 Iterative self-refinement involves creating an initial output and refining it based on self-provided feedback, similar to how humans refine their work through reflection and revision.
 The two main generative steps are FEEDBACK and REFINE, which work together to generate high-quality outputs through iterative refinement.
 SELF-REFINE uses few-shot prompting to guide the model in generating feedback and integrating it into an improved draft.
 SELF-REFINE outperforms direct generation from strong language models by achieving 5-40% absolute improvement in various tasks.
 SELF-REFINE was evaluated across 7 diverse tasks, including dialog response generation, mathematical reasoning, natural language generation, and source-code generation.
 SELF-REFINE does not require supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, relying solely on a single language model for generation, refinement, and feedback.
 The process iterates between feedback and refinement until a specified number of iterations is reached or until the model determines that no further refinement is necessary.
 SELF-REFINE provides an effective way to obtain better outputs from a single model without additional training, demonstrating that even state-of-the-art language models can be further improved at test-time.

 The two contributors are cross-lingual transfer and concept shift.
 The cross-lingual transfer gap is thought of as the difference, while the remaining difference is attributed to the concept shift.
 The results represent upper bounds for concept shift and cross-lingual shift.
 The concept shift gap is generally greater.
 The concept shift gap exceeds the cross-lingual transfer gap for all languages except Swahili.
 For Indonesian (id), zero-shot performance itself is close to English performance for XLM-R.
 The performance of Hindi and Indonesian increases significantly with larger models and more training data.
 Investing in few-shot in-language task-specific examples provides vast improvements over the zero-shot setup.
 The performance gain from few-shot transfer was generally modest.
 Kannada, Swahili, and Sundanese benefited more greatly from augmentation with additional examples.

 The cost of generation for the GPT-3 Curie model is estimated to be $0.002 per one thousand tokens.
 The estimated cost can be up to $100 for collections like Robust04 and TREC-COVID.
 The estimated cost of generation in the InPars-light study is under $10 per collection.
 The throughput exceeds 500 passages per second.

 The all-domain pretraining of the DeBERTA-v3-435M model took about 28 hours.
 The total effectiveness evaluation time for the DeBERTA-v3-435M model was about 6 hours.
 Three seeds were used for training the rankers.
 The procedure is considered in the future as an alternative for carrying out consistency checking.
 The study focuses on evaluating hallucinations in Language Model Multimodal (LMM) responses.
 The LLM is based on Vicuna and utilizes the pre-trained CLIP visual encoder, ViT-L/14.
 The response length, measured in the number of tokens, is incorporated as a penalizing factor to control hallucinations in LMMs.
 The RL models have similar architectures to the base LLaVA model, but the reward model outputs a scalar value indicating the reward of the response.
 The MMHAL-BENCH evaluation metrics focus on detecting hallucinations in LMM responses, while previous benchmarks evaluate response quality in a more general sense.
 The MMHAL-BENCH includes questions related to object attributes, adversarial objects, comparisons, counting, spatial relations, environment, holistic descriptions, and others.
 The image-question pairs are designed to cause hallucinations in LMM responses, ensuring that LMMs make false claims about the image contents when answering these questions.
 Researchers select images from the validation and test sets of OpenImages and design brand-new questions to avoid data leakage or evaluation on data that LMMs have observed during training.
 The powerful GPT-4 model is used to analyze and rate LMM responses by comparing them against image contents and human-generated answers provided in the prompt.
 GPT-4 is used to determine whether hallucinations exist in LMM responses by comparing them against image contents and human-generated answers, as the GPT-4 model can only assess text inputs.
 The motivation is that relevant documents would contain similar entities contained in the query, so it is important that the query also makes part of the entity matrix.
 The parameter 𝛾 controls the weight balance between the entities in the query vector and the entities in the top passages matrix.
 The unrolled expression is represented as the product of the query vector and the top passages entity matrix with weights determined by 𝛾.
 The purpose is to design a more informative, conversation-specific weighting scheme using passage rank scores to signal the presence of entities in passages and the query.
 The scores of each passage entity of CP are computed based on the full-text retrieval ranker scores, RS.
 The original multi-hot binary encoding is used as the weighting scheme for the entities in the query vector CQ.
 Eigenvector methods are used as an implementation of random walks to estimate entity centrality scores.
 The EC scores are computed as a combination of the graph structure, damping factor, and the centrality scores of entity i.
 The scoring vector is based on the dot product between EC scores and the entity-passage matrix CP.
 The purpose is to balance the original scores from the full-text retrieval ranker with the entity centrality scores to improve the ranking of passages.

 The function of the distinguishability metric is to measure how well CodeBERTScore can differentiate between similar and dissimilar code snippets.
 The distinguishability metric shows that CodeBERTScore achieves higher distinguishability scores than CrystalBLEU for both Java and C++ datasets.
 The distinguishability metric can be manipulated by exponentiating the output score of CodeBERTScore, resulting in inflated distinguishability scores.
 Distinguishability is not considered reliable because it can be easily manipulated by comparing absolute scores across different metrics.
 The text suggests that comparing metrics based on how they rank different examples is more reliable than comparing them based on exact scores.
 Figure 8 illustrates how distinguishability increases exponentially when the original CodeBERTScore is exponentiated by different values of k.
 The text recommends comparing metrics based on how they rank different examples rather than relying on exact scores for a more reliable comparison.
 The purpose of providing additional examples is to showcase scenarios where CodeBERTScore outperforms the best baseline metric by preferring functionally correct predictions.
 The motivation behind showing the C++ example in Figure 10 is to highlight a scenario where CodeBERTScore ranks a functionally correct prediction higher than the best baseline metric.
 The Java example in Figure 9 aims to demonstrate how CodeBERTScore favors the functionally correct prediction over an incorrect one by ranking it higher.
 The results show that neither too small nor too large a dimensionality is useful for the proposed tasks, and there is little interaction between task type and dimensionality.
 Model ranking based on each task is very similar across dimensions, with Spearman and Pearson correlations of 0.61 and 0.79, respectively.
 Similarly to changing the dimensionality, the individual tasks react to changing the training data size without an effect of the task variable.
 Phonological features, especially articulatory features, play a strong role in phonology by capturing the similarity between sounds.
 The articulatory feature set employed by PanPhon originates in the Sound Pattern of English by Chomsky and Halle (1968).
 Applications include cognate/loanword detection, multilingual named entity recognition, keyphrase extraction, spelling correction, phonotactic learning, and more.
 Training with phoneme embeddings can reduce errors from confusing phonetically similar words in automatic speech recognition.
 One limitation is that the models train on phonemic transcriptions, which cannot capture finer-grained phonetic distinctions.
 The proposed future work includes enlarging the pool of languages and including more tasks.
 Phonological word embeddings serve as a tool to study what phonological and phonetic features are encoded by speakers for linguistic analysis.

Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade.
No, such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors, or decisions.
The transcript will record where these courses were taken but without grade.
This information is determined by the QPA (Quality Point Average) calculated from Carnegie Mellon courses and cross-registration program courses.
In this context, 'QPA' stands for Quality Point Average.
Yes, students can take courses from other universities through the university's cross-registration program.
In this context, 'cross-registration' refers to a system where students can take courses from other universities while still being enrolled at their home university.
The purpose is to indicate where these courses were taken, but without grade.
In the context of this text, 'QPA' stands for Quality Point Average.
QPA calculations are a method used to evaluate academic performance in college.
Students who have been suspended may also receive transfer credit, but only if their college's and department's policies allow it.
The student's advisor serves as an advocate for the student during the faculty's evaluation process.
At the end of each semester, students prepare a statement about their achievements and plans for the next semester. The faculty then evaluates each student's academic progress.
A good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing their degree.
If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether they can finish their degree and what needs to be accomplished for them to get back on track. This is considered a serious warning.
An N-1 letter specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all these conditions may result in the student's termination from their program.
Satisfactory progress refers to a student making sufficient academic achievement towards completing their degree requirements.
If a student is doing well, there is no official record of the letter in their transcript. However, if they receive an N-1 letter or fail to meet satisfactory progress requirements, this may be noted on their academic record.
The LTI may remove the student from the program or strongly encourage them to consider switching to the four-semester program (MIIS-21) to complete all requirements.
The student may be terminated from the program.
Students should review the University Policy on Academic Integrity, which is available online at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html.
In this handbook, satisfactory progress refers to a student's successful completion of degree requirements each semester.
An N-1 letter specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all these conditions may result in termination from the program.
If a student does not make satisfactory progress, they may be removed from the program or strongly encouraged to consider switching to the four-semester program (MIIS-21) to complete all requirements.
The MIIS Graduate Student Handbook provides guidelines and expectations for students in the Master of International Information Systems (MIIS) program at Carnegie Mellon University.
The academic integrity policy outlines the university's expectations around academic honesty and provides definitions for cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.
The three primary goals outlined in Carnegie Mellon University's mission statement are to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, and serving students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, as well as the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work.
The University Policy on Academic Integrity outlines the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of academic integrity. It also includes an appeal process.
The responsibility of the entire community at Carnegie Mellon University is to establish and maintain the integrity of the university, ensuring that students actively reflect on academic challenges and that discussions are supported within the community.
If a student fails to identify conceptual sources in their work, it is considered dishonest and can result in disciplinary action for cheating or plagiarism.
Carnegie Mellon University aims to create and disseminate knowledge and art, teach and learn, transfer to society, serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community.
Maintaining academic integrity at Carnegie Mellon University ensures that students are educated professionals who will serve society with integrity, and that the university creates and disseminates new knowledge in ways that benefit society.
The purpose of reviewing the Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures is to understand the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of academic integrity.
Students can exercise good judgment in a challenging academic environment by actively reflecting on academic challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process.
Carnegie Mellon University serves the changing needs of society through its three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: creating and disseminating knowledge, teaching and learning, and transfer to society.
The ethical responsibility of each student in any presentation, creative work or research is to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is considered dishonest and can lead to charges of cheating or plagiarism.
If a graduate student commits a second violation while on disciplinary probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.
Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process.
The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. This includes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process.
A first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program.
If we decide to not immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation.
The penalty for a second violation while on disciplinary probation is dismissal from the graduate program.
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook, page 23
The LTI (Learning Technology Initiative) implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program”.
A student in the program may not take more than sixty (60) units per semester without permission from the program director.
MIIS-16 students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in three semesters of academic study and one summer internship (16 months total).
A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval.
MIIS-21 students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in four semesters of academic study and one summer internship (21 months total).
A student in the program must be registered for a minimum twelve (12) units per semester to be considered a part-time student.
MIIS students are given the opportunity to defer their enrollment. The deferral request must be approved by the program director. The deferral can only be used once for the period of one academic year.
MIIS-16 students enrolled for part-time study are expected to complete the program in six semesters of academic study and one summer internship (27 months total).
A student in the program must be registered for a minimum thirty-six (36) units per semester to be considered a full-time student.
A student in the program may not take more than sixty (60) units per semester without permission from the program director.
A student must register for at least 36 units per semester to be considered a full-time student, and 12 units per semester to be considered a part-time student.
Yes, all international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status.
No, Reduced Course Load is not permitted for MIIS students.
If an international student fails to maintain full-time status, they will lose their student visa (and therefore 'permit of stay'.)
Yes, an equivalent graduate course may be permitted to satisfy one of the MIIS breadth requirements.
The decision is made by the MIIS Program.
Yes, an equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the MIIS breadth requirements.
Students can find information about the MIIS Graduate Student Handbook on page 24 of the handbook.
The purpose of the MIIS Graduate Student Handbook is to provide information about policies and procedures for students in the program.
Students may request to transfer into the MIIS program after completing their first semester and before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MIIS Program Director.
The MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request. The program will explicitly consider whether the coursework done prior to the transfer will allow the student to be “on schedule” by the end of the spring semester, so that the student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall semester.
No, satisfying a breadth requirement with a course from another institution does not reduce the number of CMU course units that must be taken to attain the MIIS degree.
The student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student’s transcript to make the decision.
Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities.
Students may request to transfer into the MIIS program after completing their first semester and before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester.
The purpose of the expedited admissions process is to consider whether the coursework done prior to the transfer will allow the student to be “on schedule” by the end of the spring semester, so that the student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall semester.
The Program Director will inform the student about what application materials are required, for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts.
Transfers into the MIIS program are not permitted during a student’s first semester at CMU. Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them.
LTI stands for Learning Technology Initiative.
The director of the program makes this decision.
If a student is exempt, they can replace that course with an open elective. They do not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward their degree in its place.
If a student receives credit, they receive that many units of credit. The total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.
An open elective is a course that can be taken as an option for students who are exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience.
Units of credit refer to the amount of academic work that is equivalent to one hour of class time per week for a semester. If a student receives credit, they receive that many units.
Equivalent graduate courses are courses completed at another institution that have the same level of difficulty and content as those offered by MIIS Graduate Student Handbook.
The purpose is to allow students who are exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience to take any course that could normally count toward their degree in its place.
If a student does not receive credit, they must complete the required coursework as stated in MIIS Graduate Student Handbook.
External employment and consulting are strongly discouraged in the MIIS program. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss this with their Advisor.
The LTI discourages LOAs, as students usually do not return after taking one. However, a student in good standing may be granted an LOA for at most 1 year upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of their Advisor.
The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even after it has been granted if there's discovery that the work or academic records upon which it was based were falsified. The complete reference to this policy can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html.

 Genetic Improvement (GI) is a search-based software engineering technique used to find improved program variants by iterating over different versions of software.
 GI patches are constructed from a set of edits to code, known as mutations, which describe modifications to the program being improved.
 The fitness function is used to measure the effectiveness of GI patches in terms of desired outcomes such as passing tests or execution time improvement.
 Genetic Improvement (GI) differs from traditional software improvement techniques by using search-based optimization to find improved program variants through iterative changes.
 GI is considered fully automated because developers only need to review the patches produced by GI once the process is finished, ensuring no unintended side effects.

Scotty's full name is Montgomery Scott, or just plain 'Scotty' for short.
In general, Scotty seems to enjoy and take pride in his work as chief engineer of the USS Enterprise.
One unique ability that Scotty possesses is his exceptional knowledge of engineering, particularly when it comes to repairing and maintaining the USS Enterprise's systems.
Scotty frequently says 'I cannae do that Captain!' which is a humorous way of saying he needs more time or resources to complete the task at hand.
Scotty's character adds humor and depth to the show, as well as providing a competent and resourceful engineer who is crucial for the success of the USS Enterprise's missions.
Scotty has a high level of respect for Captain Kirk, often referring to him as 'the captain' and showing loyalty towards his commanding officer.
Carnegie Mellon adopted a Scottish terrier as their official mascot because Andrew Carnegie, founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet.
The decision to adopt a Scottish terrier as Carnegie Mellon's official mascot was made in 2006.
The co-chairs of the Mascot Identity Task Force were Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church.
Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for a Scottish terrier.
The Task Force partnered with SME Branding, a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities.
Carnegie Mellon's official Scottish terrier mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game.
Carnegie Mellon's Scottish terrier mascot features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage.
The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival.
According to the text, the Scottish terrier breed is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression. Its temperament is described as determined and thoughtful while its physical aspects exemplify strength, power and agility.

 Experiments ran on ResNet-18 trained over CIFAR-10.
 The search space is vast because for a two hidden layer fully connected neural network with 100 neurons in each layer and training with 100 epochs, the cardinality of the search space is 2 x 10^6.
 Traditional NAS methods necessitate concurrent training of both network architecture and network weights, resulting in computational requirements that substantially exceed those of standard model training.
 The automated low-rank factorized training method introduced in the paper is called CUTTLEFISH.
 CUTTLEFISH performs lightweight profiling to identify the layers to factorize, ensuring that factorization occurs only in layers that can effectively enhance the training speed.
 CUTTLEFISH observes that factorizing early layers in CNNs does not lead to considerable speedups.
 The stable ranks of neural network (NN) layers initially change rapidly and then converge to a constant mean.
 CUTTLEFISH automatically selects all factorization hyperparameters during training on-the-fly, eliminating the need for multiple experimental trials for factorization hyperparameter tuning.
 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests that smaller, randomly initialized subnetworks can be trained to attain accuracy levels comparable to those of the full network.
 Sparsity methods mainly focus on unstructured sparsity, which does not yield actual speedups on current hardware, unlike low-rank training which can lead to tangible acceleration.
 The focus of the research is low-latency speech translation.
 It is important to evaluate different approaches to low-latency speech translation to compare and improve the effectiveness of such systems.
 The proposed framework allows for evaluating various aspects of low-latency speech translation in realistic scenarios and comparing different approaches.
 Low-latency speech translation is particularly important in scenarios like presentations or meetings.
 Some components include Speech processing, Text processing, Website, Mediator, API, Audio Client.
 The system uses a central mediator that coordinates the interaction of different components and dynamically defines how data is sent to different components for each session.
 The main contributions are a framework for low-latency speech translation with dynamic latency adjustment, an evaluation setup for assessing low-latency scenarios, and a comprehensive evaluation of different translation approaches and streaming algorithms.
 The system minimizes increasing latency in high-load situations by enabling the middleware to skip intermediate processing steps and combining multiple input messages.
 The central mediator coordinates the interaction of different components and forwards data between the user, API, and processing components.
 Each component in the system, such as the middleware and backend, enables flexible processing with the help of the streaming framework Kafka.

 One of the main drawbacks is that it is susceptible to erroneous pseudo labels that arise from confirmation biases in the source domain.
 The reliance on only photometric cues may lead to suboptimal adaptation in self-training methods.
 The proposed method is to incorporate structural cues from auxiliary modalities, such as depth, to regularize conventional self-training objectives.
 The contrastive pixel-level objectness constraint pulls pixel representations within a region of an object instance closer, while pushing those from different object categories apart.
 The objectness constraint is agnostic to ground-truth semantic labels because it is used to improve unsupervised domain adaptation.
 The regularizer significantly improves the top performing self-training methods (by up to 2 points) in various UDA benchmarks for semantic segmentation.
 The blue-dashed-boxes represent high-confidence regions that are likely to be included in the set of pseudo-labels despite being mis-classified.
 An important limitation is the excessive cost and time taken to annotate images at a pixel-level.
 Self-training based adaptation is susceptible to erroneous pseudo labels arising from confirmation bias in the seed model, which can lead to sub-optimal performance.
 The proposed method aims to incorporate auxiliary modality information such as depth maps to provide structural cues, in addition to photometric cues.
 top-k and nucleus sampling (or top-p)
 It becomes easier to detect whether a writing sample was generated by a language model or human-written, and it helps in reducing biases introduced by decoding settings.
 It helps in detecting generated text and uncovering biases caused by decoding settings which truncate a model’s predicted distributions.
 They are deployed in APIs and websites that allow users to input prompts and receive generated text.
 To identify the decoding strategy employed for text generation, even in a blackbox setting.
 Because it only allows generating one output for a given prompt and tends to produce repetitive and low-quality text.
 Tokens are chosen from the k most likely items, where all other items are assigned a score of 0 before sampling.
 To reduce entropy in the distribution before sampling to prevent text from being too erratic and error-prone.
 Top-k sampling selects a fixed number of most likely items (k) while top-p sampling selects items to cover a fixed proportion (p) of the total probability mass.
 They require more complex implementations and are not the focus of the current paper.

 The TDT architecture jointly predicts a token and its duration during sequence-to-sequence tasks.
 TDT models can skip input frames guided by the predicted duration output, which makes them significantly faster than Transducers that process the encoder output frame by frame.
 Improvements include the replacement of LSTM encoders with Transformers, Contextnet, and Conformers, as well as exploring different decoders like stateless decoders and Echo State Networks.
 The TDT model introduces a novel architecture that jointly predicts tokens and durations, achieving better accuracy and faster inference in various sequence transduction tasks.
 ESPNet, NeMo, Espresso, and SpeechBrain are some of the toolkits mentioned with efficient implementations for speech recognition models.
 FastEmit introduces biases in the gradient update of the transducer loss to reduce latency during inference.
 TDT models improve the intent accuracy by up to over 1% (absolute) compared to conventional Transducers, while also running up to 1.28X faster.
 The predicted token duration can direct the model decoding algorithm to skip frames during inference, leading to faster computation.
 LRNNT(y|x) represents the log-probability of an audio utterance x with corresponding text y, requiring summing over all possible ways to augment the text sequence to match the audio.

 The main focus of the paper is on accelerating diffusion-based combinatorial optimization solvers by progressive distillation.
 The proposed method is to use progressive distillation to take fewer steps during the denoising process.
 The progressively distilled model can perform inference 16 times faster with only a 0.019% degradation in performance on the TSP-50 dataset.
 A significant portion of combinatorial optimization problems fall into the category of NP-complete problems.
 Traditional approximation algorithms often demand an extensive degree of mathematical understanding specific to each individual problem.
 DRL models focus on training an agent to learn heuristics for solving CO problems by interacting with its environment.
 Diffusion-based methods are inefficient in inference due to the non-trivial number of inference steps required to produce satisfactory results.
 The objective function Js incorporates both the cost and validity of the solution.
 The optimal solution x∗ minimizes the objective function Js for the TSP instance.

The author of 'The Kiltie Band' is Robert Louis Stevenson.
The main theme of 'The Kiltie Band' is a group of boys who form a band and their adventures together.
The boys in the story live in Scotland, specifically in Edinburgh.
The band formed by the boys in 'The Kiltie Band' is called The Kilties.
The boys want to form a band because they are inspired by their music teacher, Mr. Sinclair, and his love for music.
In 'The Kiltie Band', Davie plays the drums.
The boys come up with the name 'The Kilties' by combining the word 'kilt,' which is a traditional Scottish garment, and '-ties,' to represent their friendship.
At the end of 'The Kiltie Band', the boys perform in front of a large audience and receive great applause, indicating that they have succeeded as musicians.
Mr. Sinclair is the music teacher who inspires the boys to form a band and helps them practice and improve their musical skills.
The Kiltie Band began in 1908 with a group of just seven students dedicated to supporting Carnegie Tech football.
The Kiltie Marching Band consists of musicians and colorguard and plays at all Carnegie Mellon home football games.
After football season, the Kiltie Concert Band plays a holiday concert and two spring concerts, including a performance at Carnegie Mellon’s Spring Carnival.
A part of the band gets together and acts as a pep band for the basketball teams.
The Kiltie Band is a campus organization recognized by Student Senate.
During football season, the Kiltie Marching Band practices Mondays and Thursdays from 5:30 p.m.-7:30 p.m., with a Game Day practice at 9:30-11:00 a.m.

 The purpose of an RNN-T model is to transform input speech frames into a high-level representation, and to model the sequence of non-blank labels that have been output previously.
 The prediction network in an RNN-T model generates output labels by producing the previous non-blank label sequence.
 The joint network in an RNN-T model produces a probability distribution over the output symbols given the prediction network state and a specific encoded frame.
 An RNN-T model reduces some of the independence assumptions in CTC by making the output at a given time dependent on the sequence of previous non-blank predictions.
 In an RNN-T model, the blank symbol represents the termination of a sequence of zero or more symbols in C for each input encoder frame.
 The set ARNNT(X,C) in an RNN-T model represents all valid alignment sequences of T + L symbols in C∗b, which are identical to C after removing all blanks.
 The purpose of the recurrent neural aligner (RNA) model is to define a probability distribution over blank-augmented labels and to remove conditional independence assumptions from the RNN-T model.
 In the RNA model, valid alignments consist of length T sequences in C∗b with exactly T-L blank symbols and are identical to C after removing all blanks.
 The prediction network state in an RNN-T model depends on the previously output non-blank labels, while in an RNA model, it depends on the entire alignment sequence.
 The RNA model is only allowed to output a single label – either blank or non-blank – in a single frame, unlike the RNN-T model.
 Table 2 shows the strict accuracy (Top Min) of cross-encoder compared to bi-encoder Recall@min for various tasks.
 Multilingual R@min refers to the strict accuracy of the bi-encoder under Top Min conditions.
 System (d) is the only hierarchy-aware system that outperforms the baseline across all metrics.
 The large performance gap of cross-encoders between the two tasks confirms that the crosslingual setting is more challenging.
 Cross-encoders enhance bi-encoder performance on the test set in multilingual tasks.
 Table 3 presents the hierarchical relation extraction results of a set-based approach using the retrieved candidates by the best performing bi-encoder.
 The proposed method demonstrates high rankings for true parents on both tasks, showing its capability in aiding humans to discover new hierarchical relations.
 The Wikinews dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the baseline and the two hierarchy-aware linking systems.
 The paper presents the task of hierarchical event grounding using a multilingual dataset with Wikipedia and Wikidata.
 Some potential future directions include adapting encoders to include hierarchy directly and exploring hierarchical relation extraction on standard datasets.
 The stress ratio is directly proportional to the crack length.
 The effective length of the crack tip decreases, leading to a sudden increase in crack tip stress and a sudden change in the crack propagation rate.
 An increase in thickness leads to a downward curve shift in the K-a relationship, showing that thickness is inversely proportional to K.
 The stress intensity factor decreases as thickness increases, resulting in a lower crack growth rate.
 The critical value of rapid fracture cycles at a thickness of 10 mm was approximately 335,330 cycles.
 Some forms of corrosion pit mentioned are conical, cylindrical, etc.
 Stress ratios of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 were used.
 The curves of corroded specimens fluctuate and experience a sharp-slow-sharp growth process.
 ASTM E647-15 provides guidance on the thickness of the CT specimen.
 Increasing thickness results in a lower crack growth rate.
 The goal of the adversary is to estimate k while keeping n as small as possible.
 The ideal prompt m gives responses that are perfectly uniform over the entire vocabulary V.
 The number of unique items in a set of responses can be observed by calling Gen(m) n number of times, each time keeping the first token of the output.
 It is exceedingly difficult to engineer a prompt that gives perfectly uniform distributions over the entire vocabulary.
 The construction of a prompt m that distributes substantial probability mass onto a subset Vm of the token space is the key building block.
 The algorithm estimates p by using two prompts m1 and m2 that return responses from known distributions, calculating the average of the estimated p values from m1 and m2.
 The top-p reverse engineering problem reduces to top-k when given a known distribution.
 This approach ensures robustness against an imperfectly guessed distribution, especially when prompts including exemplars create biases in the returned tokens.
 Using such prompts reduces the error in estimating p, which is determined by how close the guessed distribution is to the true underlying one.
 The algorithm uses the actual distributions over tokens for distribution matching by summing the k largest in-vocabulary probabilities, ensuring consistency.

 The Unlimiformer approach allows for processing unlimited input sequences by offloading cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index.
 Unlimiformer aims to extend the capabilities of existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformers to accept inputs of unbounded length at test time.
 Unlimiformer achieves this by allowing every attention head in every decoder layer to retrieve its top-k keys from a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, rather than attending to every key.
 Unlimiformer is especially useful for tasks involving long narratives, such as book summarization, where inputs can exceed 500k tokens.
 Unlimiformer does not require further training of position embeddings or global attention weights, making it a more computationally efficient solution for handling long inputs.
 Datasets with inputs that are many times longer than the maximum input length of traditional models can benefit from Unlimiformer.
 By performing a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) search to select a set of per-attention-head tokens to attend to from the full-length input.
 Unlimiformer not only outperforms strong long-range transformers like LED and PRIMERA but can also be applied on top of such models to further improve their performance.
 Unlimiformer uses a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index to allow the model to attend only to the top-k keys, which covers more than 99% of the attention mass.
 The kNN index can be stored in either GPU or CPU memory and can be queried in sub-linear time, making it a memory-efficient solution.

 LMs provide a prior probability distribution, P(C), for a given sentence C.
 The probability distribution P(C) is computed as P(C) = Π(i=1 to L+1) P(ci|c0:i−1) where ci represents the i-th token of C.
 N-gram LMs rely on the Markov assumption that the probability distribution of the next token depends only on the previous N-1 tokens.
 Smoothing techniques are applied to avoid estimating probabilities based on zero or very small counts for rare token sequences in N-gram models.
 The FNN-LM outperforms classical N-gram LMs due to its distributed representation of each token and history, leading to better generalization.
 The RNN-LM can exploit longer contextual information over N-1 previous tokens using recurrent connections, allowing it to outperform other N-gram-based models in many tasks.
 Convolutional neural networks in ConvLMs replace the recurrent connections used in RNN-LMs with gated temporal convolutions for computing hidden vectors.
 The FNN-LM estimates N-gram probabilities using a neural network and provides a better generalization than classical N-gram LMs.
 The RNN-LM computes the hidden vector as a recurrent function of the input token and the previous hidden vector, allowing it to hold longer contextual information.
 N-gram LMs suffer from data sparsity problems and poor generalization due to their reliance on discrete representations of tokens and history.

 The phonatory module equips a diffusion-based voice generation model with a voice code 𝑒 as a condition to conduct voice style cloning to help us understand the relationship between face geometry and voice characteristics.
 The three types of AMs computed are proportion, angle, and distance.
 During training, the loss for each segment is computed individually and then averaged as the training loss.
 The objective is to produce a small variance for the uncertainty estimator if the prediction error is small and vice versa, indicating a close prediction to the ground truth.
 The predicted AM and its uncertainty are given by aggregating the predictions among all segments, assuming the short segments are class-conditionally independent.
 To successfully reject the null hypothesis, a learned estimator 𝐹𝑘 (𝑣) must perform better than the chance-level estimator 𝐶𝑘 without using voice input, with statistically significant results.
 The null hypothesis states that the Abstract Measure (AM) 𝑚 (𝑘 ) is NOT predictable from voice.
 The uncertainty of the predicted 𝑘-th AM is calibrated by multiplying the computed aggregated variance by the number of voice segments in the long recording.
 The more reasonable learning objective is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the predicted variances when the predicted variances are small.
 The purpose is to identify AMs that are predictable from voice by comparing the performance of estimators with and without the voice input, rejecting the null hypothesis for AMs that are predictable.

 The CLUTRR dataset is divided into different difficulties measured by k, the number of facts used in the reasoning chain.
 There are 10K data points in the training set for the CLUTRR dataset.
 The symbolic program of DBpedia-INF consists of 26 predicates, 161 soft rules mined from DBpedia, and 16 rules defining the negation and symmetry between the predicates.
 The main model is DSR-LM, which uses RoBERTa as the underlying LM.
 The main purpose of the DBpedia-INF dataset is to deduce the relationship between any two entities based on a synthetic passage and deductive logic rules.
 During testing, 150 rules are used for symbolic reasoning.
 DSR-LM-DeBERTa uses DeBERTa as the backbone LM, while DSR-w2v-BiLSTM uses word2vec for word embedding and BiLSTM for sequential encoding.
 GPT-3 variant contains 175B parameters.
 The models compared to DSR-LM include pretrained large language models like BERT and RoBERTa, non-LM counterparts like BiLSTM and BERT-LSTM, structured models like GAT, RN, and MAC, and neuro-symbolic models like CTP and RuleBert.
 DSR-without-LM takes the ground truth structured entity relation graph as input.
 The primary focus of the meta learning research mentioned in the text is on communication cost optimization and efficient distributed training.
 SAMA enables efficient DDP by developing a communication strategy that performs the first two backward passes locally on each device, and then overlaps computation in the final backward pass with communication.
 The workflow diagram of SAMA helps to visualize and understand the communication optimization strategy implemented in the framework.
 The application of meta learning focused on in the text, other than few-shot learning, is data optimization.
 Weak supervision aims to reduce data labeling costs by generating labels for a large amount of data using multiple weak labeling functions, such as hand-designed rules and other neural networks.
 Data reweighting and label correction are utilized as data optimization operations for weak supervision in the text.
 The bilevel optimization formulation is λ∗ = (λ∗ r, λ∗ c ) = argmin L(Dclean; θ∗(λr, λc)) λr ,λc s.t. θ∗(λr, λc) = argmin θ 1 |Dnoisy| (cid:88) (x,y)∈Dnoisy w(L; λr) · L(f (x; θ), c(x, y; λc))
 The WRENCH benchmark datasets are used to evaluate the scaling efficiency of SAMA in text classification.
 The experiments showed noticeable improvements in noisy text classification accuracy of the large Transformer model with the help of small additional clean data in the meta level. SAMA performed better compared to SAMA-NA, emphasizing the importance of algorithmic adaptation when an adaptive optimizer is used.
 SAMA is compared to other implicit-differentiation-based meta learning algorithms, namely Neumann Series and conjugate gradient, in terms of GPU memory usage (MB) and throughput (samples/sec) on the AGNews dataset to evaluate compute/memory efficiency.
 The primary focus is on enhancing end-to-end conversational speech translation through target language context utilization.
 The authors propose incorporating target language context and introducing context dropout.
 Including longer context has been shown to benefit machine translation by improving coherence and accuracy.
 The text introduces a context-aware end-to-end speech translation that leverages context in the output side.
 The proposed framework employs target language context, robustness to context absence through dropout, and context enrichment with speaker information.
 The challenges mentioned are high context dependence for meaning, informal language usage, and data scarcity.
 Unlike existing work, the proposed approach focuses on conversational speech translation and incorporates previous translations as context.
 The primary contributions are a context-aware end-to-end speech translation framework, improved robustness through context dropout, and context enrichment with speaker information.
 Consistency is crucial in language understanding because the meaning of utterances often depends on the broader conversational context.
 The architecture includes conformer encoders with hierarchical CTC encoding and transformer decoders.

 It is independent of one another.
 8 syndromes
 Because the implicated genes impact FOXP2 pathways.
 Its disruption in function may lead to the co-occurrence of oncological and speech issues.
 The literature reports normal speech for some subjects despite the expected effects on speech.
 Its role in speech needs to be re-evaluated given its influence on biological pathways and speech.
 It is the only other gene in the level-1 voice chains connected to only 8 other pathways and likely plays a strong role in influencing speech.
 It suggests that biomarkers of some oncological conditions may also be present in voice.
 The specific pattern corresponds to a unique compositional unit of speech (phoneme), and when a speaker enunciates different phonemes, the vocal tract, mouth, nose, and other facial structures act in concert.
 The AM Estimator is used to predict articulatory movements (AMs) from phonemes.
 It is considered a classic regression problem.
 The main goal is to investigate the correlations between each phoneme and AM pair.
 The segmented phonemes are transformed into log mel spectrum to capture information from the frequency domain, and an AM estimator is employed to predict each AM from phonemes. Hypothesis testing is then used to analyze the correlation.
 The purpose is to determine whether a specific phoneme can predict an AM.
 The null hypothesis is that the AM is not predictable from the phoneme.
 The chance level estimator is calculated as the mean of all instances of the phoneme in the training set.
 The one-sided paired-sample t-test is used to test the hypothesis.
 The significance level chosen is α = 0.05.

 The shape of the complex spectrum generated by the STFT module is 2 × F × T, where 2 denotes the real and imaginary parts, F is the number of frequencies, and T is the number of frames.
 The TAC module in the proposed model is used for channel modeling.
 The bottleneck dimension N is projected by the point-wise convolutional layer in the proposed model.
 The PReLU activation is applied to the output in the proposed model.
 The output is a single-channel representation of the same shape after processing by K stacked multi-path blocks.
 The proposed method is called unconstrained speech enhancement and separation (USES).
 The linear shift of the frequency response of STFT filterbanks for all center frequencies allows for consistent T-F representations across different sampling frequencies.
 The spectra have the same number of frames and different numbers of frequency bins, while the resolution is consistent across different sampling frequencies.
 The original TFPSNet model was modified by adopting the complex spectral mapping method, replacing convolutional layers for mask estimation with a single 2D convolutional layer, and replacing projection layers with 2D convolutional and transposed convolutional layers.
 The proposed USES model can build a sampling-frequency-independent (SFI) model by leveraging the property of consistent T-F representations across different sampling frequencies.

 To uncover the internal structure of a multi-participant conversation by finding all the discourse links and corresponding relations.
 Previous work either treats the task as a series of independent multiple-choice problems or restricts the encoding to only local interaction.
 The proposed method improves upon previous work from the perspectives of encoding and decoding.
 Structured encoding on the adjacency matrix followed by the matrix-tree learning algorithm.
 Structured inference using the modified Chiu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm.
 The proposed method does not rely on hand-crafted features to improve its robustness.
 The purpose of a dialogue discourse parser is to predict all the links and relations in a conversation accurately.
 Adding a dummy utterance at the beginning of the dialogue closely resembles a labeled multi-root non-projective spanning tree.
 The essential elements include the structured parameterization of the adjacency matrix, the directed version of matrix-tree theorem, and the modified directed spanning tree inference algorithm.
 The contributions include introducing structural inductive biases for encoding and decoding, jointly predicting discourse links and relations, and proposing a padding method for batchwise variable-length determinant calculation.

 The ML-SUPERB benchmark extends SUPERB to multilingual tasks.
 The most relevant layers for ASR are not the last few layers, and different languages show similar behavior in some cases.
 VoxPopuli provides lecture speech data for training.
 Larger language groups may not benefit as much from multilingual training, as shown by models like wav2vec2-large-23 and mHuBERT.
 Base models tend to generalize better to multilingual cases than their large versions, according to the text.
 The relevance of SSL model layers may be related to the speech domain, in addition to the speech task, as shown by the behavior observed in different languages.
 ML-SUPERB is a benchmark designed to guide users in using SSL representations according to their needs, including an analysis of the learned weights for layer importance.
 Mixtec represents conversational speech data among the sets.
 The learned weights for layer importance can guide users in the use of SSL representations according to their needs.

 The formulation suggests that there exists a solution for separation, which is most consistent with the linear system.
 In over-determined cases, it is possible to estimate the speaker images in an unsupervised way.
 F × (P − 1) × E × C is used because gp(c, f ) is E-tap and there is one such filter for each of P − 1 microphone pairs for each frequency and speaker.
 The blind deconvolution problem mentioned in the text is non-convex in nature and difficult to be solved without assuming any prior knowledge about the relative RIRs or the speaker images.
 The proposed system illustrated in Figure 1 is a DNN-based approach that models speech patterns through unsupervised learning for tackling the blind deconvolution problem.
 The intermediate estimate ˆZ(c) for each speaker c is obtained via complex spectral mapping, where the real and imaginary parts of the input mixture are stacked as features for the DNN to predict the RI parts of ˆZ(c).
 The mixture-constraint loss (MC) is computed by filtering the DNN estimate ˆZ(c) of each speaker c to approximate the P-channel input mixture.
 FCP is employed to estimate the relative RIR relating the ˆZ(c) to the speaker image captured at each microphone p, assuming that the speakers are non-moving.
 The actual number of filter taps (A and B) in the FCP process are set to I and J, both of which are hyper-parameters to tune.
 The weighting term used in balancing the importance of each T-F unit in relative RIR estimation is defined as ξ/(max(·))P.

 The main focus of the method is structured pruning of SSL speech models.
 Careful tuning of separate target sparsities is required to meet a particular budget, which is computationally expensive.
 The pruning target is able to regularize the training by achieving similar or better performance as the original model at low sparsities.
 The purpose of HJ-Pruning-MAC is to prune the entire model to directly meet a computational budget measured by MACs.
 The computation of MACs helps in calculating the percentage of MACs that are pruned, which is important for the method.
 The proposed pruning methods consistently outperform the baseline by reducing computation without degradation in performance.
 HJ-Pruning-MAC and HJ-Pruning-SepSize have similar performance because the CNN has much fewer parameters than Transformer.
 To select the best combination of target sparsities, a grid search is performed to identify the Pareto frontiers, which requires much more computation.
 The HJ-Pruning-MAC method is considered the best in terms of performance and complexity among the proposed methods.
 The overall trend in the results of intent classification on SLURP is very similar to that of ASR, with joint pruning methods outperforming.
 The extinction coefficient is largest in summer, followed by winter, and roughly the same in spring and autumn.
 About 0.4 km^-1 in summer, 0.35 km^-1 in winter, and 0.3 km^-1 in spring/autumn.
 Aerosol particles are more likely to absorb moisture and grow under high temperature and humidity conditions in summer.
 Due to buildings being heated during autumn and winter, leading to higher emissions of pollutants and higher aerosol mass concentrations.
 Highest in summer, followed by spring and autumn, and smallest in winter.
 Frequent dust events in spring result in high aerosol transport to high altitudes.
 In spring, turbulent motion transports aerosol particles to 0.5-1 km height during boundary layer development, with extinction coefficient gradually increasing until noon.
 In winter, the boundary layer height is relatively low, leading to higher extinction coefficient below 0.5 km due to pollutant emissions.
 As the sun sets, aerosols in the range 0.5-1.5 km above ground surface are depressed to lower altitudes, reducing the extinction coefficient.
 Some aerosols are retained in the residual layer, resulting in a relatively high extinction coefficient in that range.
 The main focus of the text is on reproducing Whisper-style training using an open-source toolkit and publicly available data.
 OpenAI Whisper model was trained on 680k hours of supervised speech data.
 Researchers face challenges in comprehending the underlying mechanisms, lacking access to training dynamics, and not having access to the complete model development pipeline.
 The purpose of presenting the OWSM model is to reproduce Whisper-style training using open-source tools and publicly available data, and to promote open science by releasing scripts, models, and training logs.
 Large-scale Transformers have garnered significant attention in natural language processing (NLP).
 Self-supervised learning techniques have demonstrated impressive achievements in the domain of speech processing.
 OWSM supports any-to-any speech translation as opposed to solely any-to-English translation.
 The potential risk is data leakage, as users are deprived of knowledge regarding the actual training data.
 The multitask data format used by OWSM includes tasks such as language identification, multilingual automatic speech recognition, and any-to-any speech-to-text translation.
 OWSM supports more translation directions, whereas Whisper can only perform any-to-English translation.

 The two significant challenges are understanding queries in any language and retrieving relevant passages from a collection of documents in multiple languages as well as generating appropriate responses in the same language.
 Previous works have used a retriever-reader approach, specifically the multilingual DPR (mDPR) model for retrieving documents from a corpus, and a multilingual reader based on multilingual T5 for generating suitable responses in the target language.
 Passage retrieval in conversational question answering presents new challenges as each question must be interpreted within the context of the ongoing dialogue.
 The mDPR model employs a bi-encoder architecture, utilizing a pre-trained multilingual model to encode questions and passages independently.
 The study considers Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding (LaBSE) and XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) for multilingual sentence embeddings.
 ChatGPT is used for query rewriting to summarize the conversational history more concisely and use transfer learning to generalize to French and Vietnamese rewritten queries.
 The main finding is that for the examples examined, query rewriting did not significantly improve performance over the original queries.
 The limitation is that the query rewriting observations are based on a sample size of 2000, leading to limited generalizability of findings.
 Converting the query and dialogue context history into more concise and informative questions was postulated to be advantageous for improving the efficiency of the retriever module.
 Using Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) along with the mT5 model was found to improve the overall reader performance in terms of F1, BLEU, and Rouge-L scores.

 Interacting with objects enables the robot to observe them from various angles, enhancing its ability to predict object shape compared to merely observing from a top angle.
 The full MOSAIC framework demonstrated robust performance in the fetch object task, relying solely on unified representations without additional learning.
 The results underscore the adaptability and applicability of unified representations across diverse tasks, including those involving natural language instructions.
 Considering the transfer of unified representations across different robot morphologies is mentioned as an exciting direction for future research.
 One limitation mentioned is that for the fetch object task, the evaluation was done using a zero-shot transfer condition rather than a learning-based approach to find the target object.
 In future work, the authors plan to explore learning-based policies for solving the fetch object task, potentially increasing the versatility and adaptability of their framework.
 The authors showcased the effectiveness of unified representations in tasks such as category recognition, using a simple linear probe setup.
 Foundation models are being considered towards building general-purpose robots.
 One of the intentions behind introducing the MOSAIC framework was to enable robots to generate versatile, multimodal representations and leverage these across various downstream robot tasks.
 Humans tend to have better explanations of the implications of statements compared to machines.
 The gap between the majority vote and unanimously approved examples might be due to annotators having different standards for what constitutes a good explanation.
 The basic statistics of the COBRACORPUS illustrate the average length of explanations and the distribution of target groups.
 Minority or marginalized groups like LGBTQIA+, people with disabilities, and women are among the most frequently targeted groups.
 The most frequent type of offensiveness found in the COBRACORPUS is microaggressions.
 COBRACORPUS-CF is a challenge set of counterfactual context pairs that invert the offensiveness of statements, designed to examine the limits of context-aware explanations.
 One of the difficulties of collecting counterfactual data is finding statements that are contextually ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways.
 The counterfactual contexts in COBRACORPUS-CF invert the offensiveness of the statements by presenting different contexts that change perceptions of toxicity.
 The counterfactual context pairs are classified based on the types of situations they represent, such as conversations occurring between friends, among strangers in public, at a workplace, and between family members.
 Offensive language and stereotypes might be considered more acceptable in informal settings among people who are familiar with each other, like in sports or social clubs.

 AV-HuBERT performs the best for ASR and ASV tasks.
 Fusion layers are unable to effectively utilize additional lip reading information, as performance is reduced when video is provided.
 Audio-visual models may improve audio representations by utilizing information learned from visual grounding even when only audio input is available at inference.

 The TDT model learns the alignment between an input sequence and the corresponding target sequence.
 The formula for computing the alignment P (At,u|x) is α(t, u)β(t, u).
 The variable Nd denotes the number of duration tokens.
 As Nd becomes larger in the experiments, the alignment contains longer-duration tokens.
 The purpose of the FastEmit regularization method is to reduce the delay of token emission.
 A large value of λ in the FastEmit regularization method can cause the model to diverge.
 The FastEmit regularization method scales the gradients to token probabilities by 1 + λ and keeps the gradients to blank probabilities unchanged.
 The ratio of sequence lengths mentioned in the experiments is T U = 7 : 1.
 It is observed that the first few token emissions occur rapidly with a duration set Nd = 1 but are delayed with Nd = 8.
 The training strength of λ affects the delay between token emissions by reducing the delay as λ increases.

 The paper focuses on formulating a different view on training models with imprecise label information.
 The paper proposes to treat imprecise label information as the information that imposes a deterministic or statistical restriction on the actual applicable true labels.
 The inaccessible full and precise labels Y are treated as a latent variable in the model.
 The common approach used is expectation-maximization (EM).
 The proposed framework is largely agnostic to the various nature of label imprecision, with the imprecise label affecting the computation of the posterior P (Y |X, I; θt).
 The unified framework can serve as a solution towards a unified view for learning with any imprecise labels.
 The proposed unified framework outperforms previous methods for dealing with single imprecise labels and demonstrates robustness and effectiveness for mixed label settings.
 The objective of partial label learning is to learn with a candidate label set where the ground truth label is concealed in the set.
 PiCO (Wang et al., 2022a) is the method mentioned that employs class prototypes for label disambiguation.
 The proposed approach enables the learning of a noise model for noisy labels.

The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computations.
Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook.
Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.
Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program may consult with their degree-granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances.
Some full-time master’s programs last two semesters, while doctoral programs can take several or more years to complete.
The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computations, which are often used by graduate students.
The standard length of time for a master's program varies significantly, ranging from two semesters for some full-time programs to several or more years for doctoral programs.
If a graduate student completes all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time, they may consult with their degree-granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances.
Students considering completing their graduate program in less time than the standard length should consult with their degree-granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances.
Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.
Master's students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program, and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements.
Master's students should reference CMU Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations (www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of limitations.html) for guidelines and restrictions regarding the maximum length of time allowable for master's degree completion.
Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.
If a Master's student does not complete their degree requirements within the standard time limit, they may be subject to restrictions and guidelines as outlined in CMU Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations.
The policy on Master's student statute of limitations provides guidelines and restrictions regarding the maximum length of time allowable for master's degree completion, ensuring that students are able to complete their degrees in a timely manner.
If there is an academic interruption or serious medical issue affecting progress towards a Master's degree, students are advised to remain in close contact with their graduate program and seek guidance from appropriate university resources.
If a student requires longer than the standard time for master's degree completion due to unforeseen circumstances, they are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program and seek guidance from appropriate university resources.
Academic advisors and associate deans play a crucial role in guiding students about their program of study and degree requirements, providing them with necessary information and advice.
Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.
Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit towards their current degree program.
To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree program.
International Students: Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.
The student must pass 120 or more course units.
A student needs to complete at least 72 units of 'LTI' courses and 24 units of 'SCS' courses.
The student must take 11-711, 11-791 (or an equivalent), and one 'Task Orientation Focus' class.
The student must complete 12 units of 11-910 Directed Research and 12 units of Open Elective.
Students must attend the LTI Colloquium (11-700) each semester.
The requirement is described elsewhere in the handbook.
Students can choose from 11-727, 11-731, 11-747, 11-751, 11-775, 11-776, 11-777, 11-785, or 11-797.
Students may submit their requests for additional courses to be considered by faculty members.
Course requirements must be satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study unless approved by the Program Director in advance.

The University reserves the right to withdraw the degree promptly upon discovery of the falsification.
The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification.
Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed study projects.
The faculty advisor provides career advice and ensures that every student receives necessary faculty mentoring through their personal relationship with each student.
The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html.
The information about advising in MLT graduate program comes from the MLT Graduate Student Handbook, specifically page 14.
The faculty advisor supervises the student's directed study projects.
Having a personal relationship with an advisor ensures that every student receives necessary faculty mentoring and career advice.
The purpose of withdrawing a degree when it has been falsified is to maintain academic integrity by ensuring that degrees are only granted based on genuine work and records.
The MLT Graduate Student Handbook provides information about advising in the program, including who is responsible for guiding each student's progress and what their role entails.
A degree that has been falsified will be withdrawn promptly upon discovery of the falsification.
During the first month of the program, students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (“Immigration Course,” or IC) lectures and be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors.
After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a first, second, and third choice for advisor.
Potential advisors determine how many new students they can take.
Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI’s research projects.
Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate programs serves as their advisor.
The student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. Both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change.
Forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time, so switching advisors late in their graduate studies can be disadvantageous.
The Optional Masters’ Thesis is a possibility for students who wish to undertake an independent research project. It is optional because not all students may be interested in or ready for such a commitment.
The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem.
Students can choose from several ways, including completing a Masters’ Thesis, innovative research in a research project or class project work.
No, it is optional and not required.
The two courses required are 11-928 – Masters’ Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor) and 11-929 – Masters’ Thesis II in the following Spring.
The deadline for submitting a thesis proposal is October 31st.
Each course counts towards 6 units of MLT-level LTI course credit.
The second course (11-929) counts towards one PhD lab requirement.
The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology.
Students should work with their chosen thesis advisor to define the thesis research project.
The MLT thesis culminates in an M.S. degree.
The MLT thesis committee will be composed of a thesis advisor and two additional readers, to be chosen by the student in consultation with the advisor.
The student must have prepared a written proposal of at least five pages describing the scientific thesis to be investigated, any relevant research already completed by the student, a comparison with related work by others, and a detailed description of the work to be done in the next semester. The proposal MUST be accepted by the committee by the end of October.
If the student does not have their proposal accepted by the committee by the end of October, they will not be allowed to enroll in 11-929 – Masters’ Thesis II.
The student will distribute a draft of the thesis to the committee for initial review sometime during the semester when they enroll in 11-929 – Masters’ Thesis II, typically their final semester.
The purpose of distributing a draft of the thesis early is to avoid last-minute surprises that could delay final approval of the thesis.
At least 2 out of the 3 committee members must be SCS faculty working in Language Technologies.
The written proposal prepared by the student should be at least five pages long.
The thesis advisor will guide and assist the student throughout their research process, provide feedback on their work, and help them prepare for presenting their findings.
The additional readers will review the student's proposal and draft thesis, provide feedback on their work, and help ensure that the research meets academic standards.
The final step in completing a Master's thesis is submitting the final version of the thesis document, followed by a public presentation of the work in an LTI seminar or other suitable public forum.
All information required for a public announcement must be received by the LTI graduate program administrator at least one week before the defense.
The Masters’ Thesis presentation is less rigorous than a PhD thesis defense. It must communicate the research work done, similar to a conference paper presentation.
A simple majority vote of the committee is required for approval of the thesis and presentation.
It is not required that students finish the thesis by the end of the second semester. If a student requires more time, an incomplete grade will be assessed in the Masters’ Thesis course until such time as the work and presentation are accepted.
If all other requirements for the MLT degree have been completed, a student will still be allowed to walk in Spring Commencement.
Financial support beyond the end of the semester is on a case-by-case basis and must be arranged in advance with the project supporting them.
Students are strongly encouraged to finish the thesis work within one (1) year following the semester they enroll for the first Masters’ Thesis course.
If a student requires more time to revise the thesis to the committee's satisfaction, an incomplete grade will be assessed in the Masters’ Thesis course until such time as the work and presentation are accepted.
An 'LTI course' refers to any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX. A 6-unit course with an 11-XXX counts as half of an LTI course.
An 'SCS course' refers to any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of Computer Science, including LTI. A 6-unit course with such a number counts as half of an SCS course.
LTI Focus Areas are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under 'Course Categories.' If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should notify the Chair of the LTI Graduate Programs.
An 'LTI lab course' refers to a course in the list of lab courses defined in the LTI 'Course Categories' webpage.
Yes, students are free to take elective courses outside of SCS as long as they fulfill the requirements of their program.
The student should notify the Chair of the LTI Graduate Programs. The Chair, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, will decide whether it should be in the Focus Area.
The Program Director approves electives that are technically outside of SCS and count towards this requirement, such as Digital Signal Processing in ECE.
A course refers to an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study unless otherwise specified.
Yes, as long as they fulfill the requirements of their program and discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor.

Applying the Minimum Course Grade Policy
In the MLT Graduate Student Handbook, page 17.
The LTI provides a set of lectures and talks at the beginning of each Fall semester to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty, provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students, and give students a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI.
Students are expected to attend these lectures and treat them seriously because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI.
The older name for these talks was called 'the Immigration Course (IC)', which caused confusion. The older name has been retired.
Near the end of the spring and fall semesters, students prepare a statement that describes their achievements in the current semester, and plans for the next semester. At the end of the semester, faculty evaluates each student's academic progress.
A good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degree. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used.
If a student seems to be having trouble, faculty determines whether the student can finish the degree and what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning.
If a student does not make satisfactory progress, it may affect their ability to continue in the program. However, this letter is not a permanent “black mark” on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.
LTI stands for Language Technology Institute.
Evaluations are conducted at the end of each semester, both in spring and fall.
If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning.
In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.
Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at: http://www.cmu.edu/hub/transcripts/verifications/enrollment.html.

The School of Computer Science has a policy that graduate students cannot take any other M.S. degree offered by the school without prior approval.
No, pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement in graduate programs at the School of Computer Science.
No, graduate students who need to take extra undergraduate courses to build up their core foundations in computer science cannot choose the pass/fail grading system.
For an Independent Study to be counted towards a student’s coursework, it must first be approved by the MLT Program Director. The student should then work with their supervising faculty member to create a short description of the study's goals and evaluation methods.
The student must submit their Independent Study proposal to the MLT Program Director before the end of the Add period in the semester when they plan to undertake the study.
Students planning an Independent Study must ensure it is structured and scheduled in such a way that all work is finished by the end of the semester, allowing for grading.
There's no mention in this text about whether or not an MLT student can undertake multiple independent studies. It is possible but it would depend on the specific policies of the program.
The text does not specify what happens in this case, so we cannot provide an answer based on the given information.

 Negative values indicate that MERRA-2 BC column concentrations are lower than GRASP/Component BC column concentrations.
 The evaluation has not been conducted globally due to the scarcity of aerosol component measurements on extensive temporal and spatial scales.
 The study presents a quantitative evaluation of the MERRA-2 reanalysis dust and BC column concentration using independent satellite-measured aerosol component concentration retrievals.
 Several dust emission resource regions and the critical downwind dust-dominated regions are selected for comparisons.
 MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 40~70% over African dust emission resource regions.
 The correlation coefficient varies from 0.91 to 0.80 for the temporal variation in dust column concentration over the dust emission resource regions.
 The relative differences are mostly less than 40% for Asian dust emission resource regions, even for negative values in the TAK region.
 The correlation coefficient is about 0.70~0.90 for the temporal variation in BC column concentration over the globe.
 MERRA-2 reanalysis BC products present both higher (about 80%) and lower (about -20%) column concentrations compared to GRASP/Component BC retrievals.
 The purpose is to indicate how well both MERRA-2 products and GRASP/Component retrievals can capture the temporal variations in dust and BC column concentration with a high correlation coefficient.
 The PostNet refines the predicted sequence by predicting a residual component of the target sequence.
 Transformer-TTS adopts a multi-headed self-attention mechanism by replacing the RNNs with a parallelizable self-attention structure, resulting in faster and more efficient training while maintaining high perceptual quality.
 They performed pre-training on the LJSpeech dataset, which consists of 24 hours of single-female English speech, before fine-tuning the model using a small amount of Arabic training data.
 The autoregressive models predict the target sequence iteratively, while the non-autoregressive models predict the target sequence in parallel without the need for iterative steps.
 FastSpeech2 is based on Conformer and uses a Conformer block instead of the Transformer block for the text-to-mel model.
 The duration predictor is a convolutional network that predicts the duration of each input token from the hidden representation of the encoder.
 The study used the Griffin-Lim algorithm (GL) and Parallel WaveGAN (PWG) to generate speech from the predicted mel-spectrogram.
 The audio quality was evaluated by human testers, and the word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) of the generated speech were also calculated using pre-trained ASR models.
 Vowelization of the input transcription is important to solve the mismatch between the input text and the output pronunciation.
 The reduction factor is a common parameter that decides the number of output frames at each time step, which is crucial for stable training especially with limited training data.

 AV-SUPERB specializes in audio-visual tasks from speech and audio processing.
 Three evaluation tracks are set up in AV-SUPERB.
 The three tracks are referred to as audio-only, video-only, and audio-visual fusion features.
 The goal of the benchmark is to provide insight on the generalization capabilities of pretrained representations.
 The upstream models referred to in the text are AV-HuBERT, RepLAI, AVBERT, MAViL, and HuBERT.
 The downstream models consist of a two-layer fully-connected network.
 Handcrafted features are used in the baselines to make a fairer comparison between audio and audio-visual features.
 Using a weighted sum of representations helps improve the performance of downstream tasks.
 The tasks focused on are audio event classification (AEC) and action recognition (AR).
 MAViL excels at audio processing tasks.
 Xrec represents the reconstructed examples for a target x.
 In Figure 22a, the normalized (cid:96)2 distance between the reconstruction and target is plotted against the loss of the reconstructed examples.
 Dividing the main loss by the support loss in Figure 22c increases the correlation between the contrastive loss and the (cid:96)2 distance.
 There is a small positive correlation between loss and (cid:96)2 distance, indicating that some reconstructions are visually similar to the target while others show notable differences.
 Using a contrastive loss filters out examples that are seen as likely under both models, making reconstructions more visually similar to the target.
 Figure 23 shows that the attack fails when the target image was not included in training, indicating that the model relies on memorization rather than generalization for correct inpainting.
 A total of 256 models were trained for each GAN architecture.
 For BigGAN architecture, the number of training steps was increased to 200,000 to enhance image fidelity, unlike the default hyper-parameters used for StyleGAN and MHGAN.
 The iteration that achieved the highest FID score on the test set was selected for each model trained on a randomly selected half of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
 Figures 24 and 25 contain additional examples extracted from GANs trained on CIFAR-10, showcasing training examples for different GAN architectures.

 The models were trained for 20 epochs.
 The Pyserini toolkit was used.
 The effect of different vocabulary sizes, the effect of the number of artificial terms added to the queries/documents, the usefulness of complementing existing learned sparse retrievers with the KALE vocabulary, the distribution of the generated term posting lists, and the out-of-domain performance of the proposed method.
 To assess if the vocabulary size affects the effectiveness and efficiency of the model, and to determine the optimal size for better performance.
 The authors find that combing RNN-T and AED provides a 17–22% relative improvement in word error rate over RNN-T alone on a voice search task.
 Deliberation, cascaded encoder, Y-architecture, and Universal ASR are mentioned as different techniques.
 Character-level modeling is discussed as a prominent feature, as it avoids phoneme-based modeling and pronunciation lexica.
 It is mentioned that character-level modeling is viable with classical hybrid HMM architectures and can work even without neural networks.
 Various algorithmic changes, ways to combine different E2E models, ways to incorporate context, and improved encoder and decoder architectures are discussed.
 They propose employing a multi-task learning strategy with both CTC and attention-based losses, which provides a 5–14% relative improvement in word error rate over attention-based models on specific tasks.
 Contextual biasing pertains to biasing phrases like proper nouns in a specific domain, which is important for recognizing words seen infrequently during training and improving beam search performance.
 The evolution includes moving from long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTMs) to architectures like Transformers and Conformers, which have shown competitive performance.
 The training criterion to be minimized is the negative log probability of the correct transcription given the input.
 These architectures have shown better performance compared to LSTMs by leveraging convolution, self-attention, or combining self-attention with convolution.

 The inverse toxicity filter yields the strongest performance on toxicity identification.
 Data source heterogeneity is more important than data quality for downstream performance.
 The inclusion of Common Crawl, OpenWeb, and Books had the strongest positive effects on downstream performance.
 The choice of pretraining source domains impacts downstream performance as demonstrated by ablating pretraining sources from the Pile and measuring the performance change in diverse QA tasks.
 Common Crawl, OpenWeb, and Books have the strongest positive effects on downstream performance.
 The trade-off suggested in the text is that better performance on QA and toxicity identification comes at the cost of more toxic generation.
 Removing Books, CommonCrawl, and OpenWeb lead to the greatest decrease in toxicity metrics.
 Web and Books domains cause the biggest trade-off between toxic identification and generation.
 The hypothesis is that CC, OpenWeb, and Books contain extensive coverage of many topics, which is why removing the Academic-specific category of sources does not remove all relevant academic information.
 The main challenge is collecting annotated data for model training, which can be expensive, laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone.
 Factors such as lack of annotator expertise, privacy concerns, and intrinsic difficulty in ascertaining labels precisely can make collecting precise labels difficult.
 ILL is a framework for the unification of learning with various imprecise label configurations, treating precise labels as latent variables and considering the entire distribution of all possible labeling entailed by the imprecise information.
 ILL uses expectation-maximization (EM) for modeling imprecise label information by treating precise labels as latent variables and considering the entire distribution of all possible labeling entailed by the imprecise information.
 ILL can seamlessly adapt to partial label learning, semi-supervised learning, noisy label learning, and a mixture of these settings.
 ILL surpasses existing specified techniques by offering a unified framework with robust and effective performance across various challenging settings, instead of proposing specific designs for each emerging imprecise label configuration.
 Some typical mechanisms of label imprecision include partial label learning (PLL), semi-supervised learning (SSL), and noisy label learning (NLL).
 Fig. 1 illustrates the full label and imprecise label configurations, such as full label, partial label, semi-supervised, and noisy label scenarios, using an example dataset.
 Existing approaches differ substantially and are tailored to specific forms of imprecision, which may complicate the deployment in practical settings where complex annotations with multiple coexisting imprecision configurations exist.
 It is challenging to adapt previous methods to scenarios with multiple coexisting imprecision configurations, such as both noisy labels and partial labels, due to the unique assumptions and design requirements of each method.
 They show that DIFUSCO outperforms previous probabilistic NPC solvers on benchmark datasets of TSP and MIS problems with various sizes.
 Autoregressive models.
 They face high time and space complexity challenges due to their sequential generation scheme and quadratic complexity in the self-attention mechanism.
 They assume conditional independence among variables in NPC problems.
 It uses an iterative denoising scheme to generate the final heatmap.
 They progressively add Gaussian noise to the clean data in the forward process and learn to remove noises in the reverse process.
 The optimization objective is to find the optimal solution xs∗ for a given instance s by minimizing the objective function cs(x) = cost(x, s) + valid(x, s).
 x is the indicator vector for selecting a subset from N edges.
 They define a parameterized conditional distribution pθ(x|s) such that the expected cost cs(x) * p(x|s) is minimized.
 The joint distribution pθ(x0:T) = p(xT) * Π from t=1 to T pθ(xt-1|xt).

 The main objective is to see if using MO algorithms limits GI’s ability to improve apps compared to improving only a single objective, especially in cases where one improvement can enhance two objectives.
 Assessing the runtime cost of MO-GI is important to ensure that any improvements found justify the cost of running it.
 The purpose is to determine if GIDroid could offer an attractive alternative to existing state-of-the-art tools available to developers.
 Three multi-objective algorithms - NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and SPEA2 are implemented in GIDroid for Android.
 MO algorithms were chosen because sacrificing some properties may lead to better improvements in other properties, such as with the caching operators.
 Execution time is measured using Linux’s time tool, memory usage is tracked using Java Runtime’s memory allocation tracking, and bandwidth is measured using Linux’s built-in process-level network traffic tracking.
 It was necessary because most open-source Android applications lack test suites, and existing automated testing tools focus on UI testing rather than generating assertions crucial for capturing correct app behavior.
 At least 75% branch coverage was achieved for methods used in the study.
 Developers find it simpler because they already have an understanding of the application and would get many benefits from writing tests.
 The benefits of writing tests include understanding the application better, getting other benefits like improving code quality, and ensuring correct app behavior.
 The issue is that utterances in the batch may have different duration outputs, making it difficult to fully parallelize the computation.
 By selecting the minimum of predicted durations for all utterances in the batch.
 Because skipping fewer frames than the model indicates causes the model to emit previously emitted tokens instead of the next token.
 They proposed a modification to the training loss by combining TDT loss with conventional transducer loss with a sampling probability.
 The noise robustness for TDT and RNNT ASR models was compared by running inference on Librispeech test-clean augmented with noise at different signal-noise-ratios (SNRs).
 TDT models performed much better in noisy conditions than conventional transducers, both in terms of accuracy and speed.
 The sampled loss is a combination of TDT loss with conventional transducer loss with a sampling probability ω.
 The inference speed-up for TDT models with batched inference is slightly smaller than for the non-batched case.
 TDT models help avoid the issue of performance degradation that RNN-T models face when there are repetitions of the same tokens in the text sequence.
 TDT models achieved significantly lower error rates compared to conventional RNN-T models, regardless of the type of decoder used.
 The hypothesis space Hi is a subset of Huni.
 In the extreme case where the VC dimension is 0, the error ϵ will be zero.
 A higher VC dimension implies greater model flexibility and capability of the approach.
 GLoRA is evaluated on VTAB-1K benchmark comprising 19 image classification tasks clustered into three domains: Natural images, Specialized tasks, and Structured tasks.
 GLoRA is evaluated on five fine-grained visual recognition few-shot datasets: Food101, OxfordFlowers102, StandfordCars, OxfordPets, and FGVCAircraft.
 ViT-B model pre-trained on ImageNet-21K is utilized for vision experiments in GLoRA.
 The largest GLoRA model configuration has 8 and 4 LoRA dimensions in the search space.
 The added parameter flexibility allows for user-defined trainable parameter count in the final models.
 GLoRA performs competitively across datasets in contrast to prior works and tends to fail on at least one dataset.
 GLoRA pushes the state of the art in as many as 14 out of 19 datasets under VTAB-1K.

 Self-training is helpful for all the strategies, boosting performance without the need for extra manual annotations.
 The PA strategy can roughly match the performance of FA with the same amount of reading cost while labeling fewer sub-structures.
 The adaptive ratio scheme aims to analyze the effectiveness of the ratio scheme with DPAR as a case study.
 If the value of a fixed-ratio scheme is too small, its performance lags behind others with the same reading contexts due to fewer sub-structures annotated.
 The adaptive scheme provides a reasonable solution by automatically deciding the ratio according to the model performance.
 The error rates on selected sub-structures indicate the need for manual corrections.
 In the domain-transfer experiments, in addition to unlabeled in-domain data, abundant out-of-domain annotated data is assumed.
 In NER tasks, the source domain knowledge can provide extra information to boost the results, especially in early AL stages.
 A classical pipelined approach is adopted, splitting the full task into two sub-tasks: mention extraction and relation prediction.
 The results indicate that the benefits of active learning and transfer learning can be orthogonal, and combining them can lead to promising results.
 Biased meta gradients may result in training instability.
 They are designed for first-order gradients as they do not involve Hessian-vector products.
 Approximating the base Jacobian with an identity matrix.
 Deep equilibrium model setting.
 The base Jacobian does not necessarily equate with the Hessian when an adaptive optimizer is used.
 The inconsistency between assumed and actual optimizers results in an incorrect meta gradient.
 SAMA stands for Solution Algorithm for Meta-Adaptation.
 It expands the meta Jacobian term with the chain rule to address adaptive update rules.
 The update rule u reduces to an identity matrix in the case of SGD.
 Most libraries like PyTorch only have native support for basic backward functions, not customized ones required by meta gradient algorithms.

 The task token is used to distinguish between ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and ST (Speech Translation).
 Having a separate ST token for each target language enables translation to any language.
 The text transcription is appended either with or without utterance-level timestamps.
 Three versions have been developed: OWSM v1, v2, and v3.
 Whisper was pre-trained on 680k hours of labeled audio data sourced from the Internet.
 Each long-form utterance is limited to a maximum duration of 30 seconds.
 OWSM v3 performs 4 times downsampling, resulting in a time resolution of 20ms.
 OWSM uses a joint CTC loss for ASR targets.
 OWSM supports decoding algorithms such as greedy search, beam search, and joint CTC/attention decoding (for ASR only).
 OWSM uses the same batch size as Whisper but has a smaller number of total updates.
 The main focus of GIDroid is the multi-objective automated improvement of Android apps.
 Genetic Improvement is used as a search-based technique to navigate the space of software variants and find improved software in Android apps.
 GIDroid proposes a practical approach and the first open-source tool for multi-objective automated improvement, which includes state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms and new mutation operators.
 Non-functional properties are important because they affect user experience, with 1/3 of user instances abandoning applications and 59% of bad reviews attributed to poor performance.
 The researchers wrote tests for 21 versions of 7 Android apps using GIDroid to improve runtime, memory, and bandwidth use, thus creating a new benchmark for performance improvements.
 The technique automatically re-discovered 64% of existing improvements in the mobile apps.
 By applying the approach to current software versions without known improvements, execution time was improved by up to 35%, and memory use was improved by up to 33%.
 Genetic Improvement relies on testing to validate patches by using a simulation-based testing framework to greatly improve the speed of search.
 Multi-objective optimization is significant as it helps consider properties other than direct targets for improvement, providing a broader view of how improvements affect an application.
 Genetic Improvement makes changes directly to the source code and uses meta-heuristics to find patches that improve software properties, while linters only identify areas that may cause performance issues without applying changes.
 The CP decomposition is a special case of the Tucker decomposition where the core tensor has only diagonal component values and the same rank for each dimension, allowing for more parameter reduction but being less expressive.
 The rank of the CP decomposition is restricted to the smallest dimension.
 CP decomposition is difficult to adjust with flexible parameter sizes because the rank is often limited to the kernel size, and the kernel size of the convolution layer is typically small compared to the number of channels.
 The Tensor-Train decomposition is another method for high-order tensors, involving a product of 3-order tensors. It provides flexible parameter reduction but cannot accelerate inference like the Tucker decomposition.
 The Tensor-Train decomposition involves N - 1 hyperparameters corresponding to the rank of N-th order tensors.
 The E2E SLU model aims to estimate semantic label sequences directly from input speech feature sequences, using tensor decomposition techniques for parameter reduction.
 The middle model is used as the seed model to miniaturize the final small model using tensor decomposition techniques, ensuring that the structural type remains the same.
 The number of nodes in the middle model and the size of the core tensor of the Tucker decomposition are determined from the given compression ratio.
 Sequential distillation is a technique used to downsize sequential models like encoder-decoder models by minimizing the KL-divergence criterion using softmax outputs with temperature hyperparameters.
 The rank is determined from the compression ratio in tensor decomposition by calculating the number of middle nodes or using specific formulas depending on the decomposition technique.

 MBR decoding is a method for choosing the outputs of a machine learning system based on the output with the lowest risk among multiple candidates, rather than the output with the highest probability.
 MBR provides reliable improvements across metrics for various tasks without requiring additional data or training.
 Despite its benefits, MBR is not frequently applied in natural language processing (NLP) works and knowledge of the method itself is limited.
 When a sample of sufficient size is taken, MBR almost uniformly outperforms beam search and single-output sampling across tasks, metrics, and datasets.
 Self-consistency, range voting, output ensembling, and some types of density estimation are modern generation techniques that can be viewed as special instances of MBR.
 The desirable output should be both high probability and relatively consistent with the rest of the outputs to minimize risk.
 Standard decoding chooses the most probable next token or performs a search over the output space, while MBR decoding chooses the output with the lowest risk among multiple candidates.
 The risk of a candidate decoding is calculated as the expected error under the probability distribution over the output space.
 The objective of MBR decoding is to find the candidate decoding that minimizes the expected error under the probability distribution.
 The risk is approximated by using a subset of the full output space instead of exact computation, typically by summing over independent samples from the probability distribution.

 To identify MRI features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that predict microvascular invasion (MVI) and postoperative intrahepatic recurrence in patients without peritumoral hepatobiliary phase (HBP) hypointensity.
 Microvascular invasion (MVI) is the presence of clusters of tumor cells in vessels located in the peritumoral area of the liver. It is a major risk factor for HCC recurrence after surgery.
 Peritumoral HBP hypointensity has high specificity but relatively poor sensitivity in predicting MVI.

 The aim of the study is to investigate the capability of reconstructing the 3D facial shape from voice from a geometry perspective without relying on semantic information.
 The study proposes a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, which identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face reconstruction.
 The study uses anthropometric measurements (AMs) as a proxy to link the voice and face geometry.
 The approach is evaluated on a proposed dataset with ground-truth 3D face scans and corresponding voice recordings.
 The study finds significant correlations between voice and specific parts of the face geometry, such as the nasal cavity and cranium.
 The most commonly used semantic cues in previous works on voice-face matching are gender, age, and emotion.
 The study aims to explore voice-face correlations beyond easily learned semantic biases and questions if reconstructing identity-fidelity 3D face from voice is possible.
 The study aims to disable previously used semantics (gender, age, emotion) and focus solely on the voice-face correlation from a pure geometry view.
 General 3D facial shape is represented by the 3D coordinates of a number of points on its surface called vertices.
 The proposed pipeline first predicts and verifies predictable anthropometric measurements (AMs) from the voice and then utilizes AMs to guide 3D face reconstruction.
 The Pareto fronts are found in the online repository of GIDroid (2023).
 The trade-offs between properties must be considered in the search process, showing the natural tension between them.
 SPEA2 performed the best, finding the best fronts in 11 cases.
 The caching operators introduced were highly effective, appearing in 26% of improving patches.
 The Vargha and Delaney A measure is used to calculate the magnitude of the differences between the observations of the NFPs of original applications and the improved versions.
 SO-GI found improvements to execution time of up to 33% and memory consumption of up to 72%.
 Multi-objective search found improvements to both execution time and memory, while single-objective search generally performs better when improving individual properties.
 The median time taken by MO-GI across the benchmarks was 2.6 hours, with a range between 0.1 hours and 20.6 hours.
 The time taken varied a lot between different benchmarks due to differences in test suite execution time and the number of patches that compiled.
 While multi-objective search found improvements in both execution time and memory, single-objective search produced results that improved one property in 753 of 1260 cases.

 PaLM-2 models can be prompted to generate rich MQM-like annotations, outperforming their score prediction counterparts at the segment-level.
 Over 50% of words that are part of major errors.
 Annotations predicted by PaLM-2 models are comparable to the ones produced by state-of-the-art supervised word-level evaluators.
 The difficulty arises because the set of correct translations for a given source sentence is often very large and not entirely known in advance.
 Reference-based evaluation includes a reference translation created by a professional human translator, which is used as additional information when assessing the candidate translation.
 Any scoring or ranking of translations is implicitly based on an identification of errors in the candidate translations, and asking raters to solely provide a single score can lead to rushed and noisy judgments.
 MQM framework asks human evaluators to identify error spans in candidate translations and classify those errors according to various dimensions, without providing a quality score for each translation.
 Transfer learning is important to achieve metrics with better correlation with human judgments.
 Generative LLMs consistently demonstrate impressive results in natural language understanding and zero- and few-shot transfer tasks, sparking interest in using these models for evaluation.
 Lu et al. leveraged error analysis, a prompting technique similar to AUTOMQM, to enhance ChatGPT-based evaluators.

 The text focuses on combating essentialist beliefs through psychologically and linguistically informed counterstatement generation.
 Essentialist beliefs are the belief that members of the same group are fundamentally alike.
 Essentialist beliefs can be harmful as they can perpetuate and reinforce stereotypical beliefs about social groups, leading to prejudice and biases.
 The five types of counterstatements are broadening the scope of a stereotype, providing direct counter-evidence, calling out the generalization, all groups of people deserve tolerance, conservatives can also be stupid.
 Broadening the scope of a stereotype by generalizing to other groups is the most popular strategy for countering essentialist beliefs.
 NLP plays a role in providing insights and strategies for combating essentialist beliefs through linguistically informed counterstatements.
 The intersection of NLP and psychology is important for further investigation into countering essentialist beliefs and understanding the complexities involved.
 Negative stereotypes are typically expressed as generics, generalizing a harmful quality to an entire group based on the behavior of a few individuals.
 The purpose of generating counterstatements is to challenge and counter essentialist beliefs by providing alternative perspectives and evidence.
 The three settings include when beliefs are conveyed implicitly, explicitly without context, or as an explicit inference from provided context.

 Language models compute the probability of a text by sequentially computing a representation of an already-seen context and using this representation to predict the next word.
 Most LMs calculate representations of contexts through a neural network consuming the immediate previous context.
 Retrieval-augmented LMs improve over standard neural LMs by accessing information retrieved from a large datastore, in addition to their standard next-word prediction.
 A k-nearest neighbor language model extends a trained base LM by linearly interpolating the output word distribution with a kNN model. The nearest neighbors are retrieved based on the distances between the current context embedding of the base LM and all the context embeddings in the datastore.
 It is surprising because kNN-LM reduces the perplexity of the base LM even when the kNN component is retrieving examples from the same training set that the LM was originally trained on.
 1. Using a different input representation for predicting the next tokens. 2. Approximate kNN search. 3. The importance of softmax temperature for the kNN distribution.
 55% of the performance gain of kNN-LM is attributed to ensembling the output of softmax using two representations from different layers of the transformer.
 The lack of preciseness actually helps kNN-LM to generalize better than using exact nearest neighbor search and distance calculation, possibly due to a regularization effect.
 Adding a temperature term can be crucial to the success of modeling in kNN-LM as it impacts the design decisions chosen for modeling and contributes significantly to the success.

 The size of Wds in the kNN-LM model is very large: Nds, which is usually the number of tokens in the entire training corpus, while Wsm in the standard parametric model has V embedding vectors, each with D dimensions.
 In the parametric model, hsm is the output from the feedforward layer in the last transformer block, while in the kNN-LM model, hds is the output from the multi-headed attention layer of the last transformer block.
 The parametric model uses the inner product (IP) function for similarity, whereas the kNN-LM model uses negative squared L2 distance (L2) as a similarity function.
 In the kNN-LM model, most of the datastore entries are pruned out, while in the parametric model, no values are masked.

 The three model parameters updated in the gradient descent update rule are alpha, beta, and delta.
 The key steps outlined in Algorithm 1 of the ADLES algorithm include initializing alpha, beta, and delta, iterating until convergence, solving equations with initial conditions, and updating model parameters.
 The objective of the forward-backward approach in estimating VFO parameters is to minimize the error between the generated signal at the lips and the air velocity measurement derived from the recorded voice signal by propagating the error backward through the vocal tract to adjust model parameters.
 The output signal at the lips is computed by propagating the generated excitation through the vocal tract model, represented by the VT model, to obtain the signal at the lips.
 The operator Hf represents the propagation of the generated signal through the vocal tract from the glottis to the lips, where Hf depends on the vocal-tract profile.
 The constraint in the estimation problem involves minimizing the difference between the measured and predicted volume velocities near the lip while ensuring that the dynamics of the vocal folds follow the VFO model.
 The algorithm name for the efficient gradient-descent solution is the ADLES-VFT algorithm.
 The model parameters that need to be estimated in the joint VFO-VT model include alpha, beta, delta, and the vocal tract profile.
 The essential steps in the forward pass include solving the constraint ordinary differential equations with given model parameters, obtaining the VFO model generated excitation, and propagating this excitation through the VT model.
 The boundary conditions in propagating the generated excitation through the VT model include circular assumptions at the glottis and the lips, with specific conditions related to unit normal and initial states.
 Backtranslation is a method where a trained model translates monolingual data into a target language, creating pseudo parallel data for training new models. It helps in leveraging monolingual data to improve translation.
 Multilingual supervised training data allows training a model to map a sentence from any source language into any target language contained in the training data. This approach has gained popularity and efficiency in recent years.
 The three training algorithms are: 1) many source languages and one target language (many-to-one), 2) one source language and many target languages (one-to-many), and 3) many source and target languages (many-to-many).
 Multi-task training aims to enhance the main task of machine translation by adding auxiliary tasks to the training process. This can involve sharing parameters between tasks for improved efficiency.
 Data augmentation in machine translation involves generating new data to train models. Back-translation, a method of data augmentation, generates pseudo parallel data using a trained model to improve translation.
 Pivoting in machine translation is used when no direct parallel corpus exists between two languages, but both have a parallel corpus with a third language. Two machine translation systems are trained: one translating from Language A to Language C, and the other from Language C to Language B.
 Transfer learning refers to using knowledge from one task to enhance performance on a related task. In machine translation, pretraining models on cross-language representations can lead to improved translation accuracy.
 Unsupervised machine translation (UMT) does not rely on any parallel text and uses only monolingual data. This is different from zero-shot translation, which utilizes parallel data for other language pairs.
 A big monolingual dataset is crucial for unsupervised machine translation approaches as they do not have access to parallel text. This dataset helps in training models solely on monolingual data.

 In winter, the aerosol extinction coefficient between 0.5 and 1 km gradually increases from 08:00 to 14:00, while in autumn the variation is similar to that in spring.
 The boundary layer height decreases after 14:00 in winter, pressing the aerosol particles down to below 0.5 km, and the emission of pollutants during the heating season in Beijing increases the aerosol extinction coefficient below 0.5 km.
 A heavy pollution event occurred in Beijing from February 8 to 15, 2020.
 Precipitation occurred in the Beijing area from the afternoon of February 13 to 14, which led to the gradual clearing of pollutants via wet deposition.
 The analysis focused on the cumulative growth processes of pollutants from 12:00 on 8 February to 01:00 on 9 February and from 18:00 on 10 February to 18:00 on 11 February.
 The near-surface temperature increased from -9 to -3 °C at the beginning of the relative pollution period due to the presence of an aerosol particle layer enhancing downward counter-radiation.
 The change in relative humidity was influenced by the daily change in water vapor content and temperature.
 The accumulation of pollutants caused radiative cooling near the ground, decreasing the surface temperature and forming or enhancing the inverse temperature lamination, inhibiting the diffusion of vertical turbulence and leading to a decrease in the boundary layer height.
 The PM2.5 mass concentration increased rapidly from 15 to 180 µg m−3 in PE1.
 The decrease in solar radiation due to the extinction effect of pollutants led to a decrease in the near-surface temperature and an increase in relative humidity on 11 February in PE2.

 The three main components are input processing, stability detection and output processing.
 It supports low-latency speech translation through revision mode and fixed mode.
 The method used is local agreement two (LA2) from Polák et al. (2022).
 The purpose of stability detection is to determine which parts of the output should be considered stable.
 All sentences containing only stable text are processed once and the output is sent as stable text.
 Whether a sentence is stable or unstable is determined by the speech processing component.
 The evaluation framework is used to evaluate the system in an end-to-end fashion.
 In the fixed mode, the backend model is run when at least one new word is given, while the revision mode processes all sentences containing unstable text.
 The two modes are revision mode and fixed mode.
 The chunk size hyperparameter is denoted as LA2_chunk_size.
 R2X (2) = 0.13 indicates that the model samples have good reliability.
 There is a good distinction between the dried fruits and branch exudates.
 R2X = 0.972, R2Y = 0.992, and Q2 = 0.965
 200 permutation analyses were performed.
 The intersection less than 0 indicates that the model is effective and there is no overfitting.
 A total of 60 different volatile chemical components were identified.
 The criteria used were p value < 0.05 and VIP value > 1.
 The components were divided into six groups.
 There are significant differences in the main component composition.
 They were divided into two groups and analyzed separately.

 The three observations are that SAMA is generally more compute/memory efficient than the baselines, the cost of algorithmic adaptation for adaptive optimizers is marginal, and the efficiency gap widens as compute/memory is distributed across multiple GPUs.
 The experiment was limited to up to 4 V100 GPUs due to the limited compute resources available.
 The purpose is to minimize negative transfer by identifying and exploiting relevant data while disregarding low-quality samples.
 SAMA-based data optimization leads to improvements in downstream performance on almost all datasets, unlike DAPT and TARTAN-MT.
 The text proposes to use Meta-Weight-Net (MWN) with SAMA, distributed training, uncertainty of prediction, and training data at both base and meta levels.
 The four major modifications are replacing the iterative differentiation meta gradient algorithm with SAMA, enabling distributed training, using uncertainty of prediction in addition to loss value, and using training data at both base and meta levels.
 The bilevel optimization formulation is L(Dtrain; θ∗(λ))λ∗ = argmin λ s.t. θ∗(λ) = argmin θ 1 |Dtrain| ∑(x,y)∈Dtrain w(L, U; λ) · L(x, y; θ).
 30 epochs for ImageNet-1k and 50 epochs for CIFAR-10.
 The datasets compared are ImageNet-1k and CIFAR-10.
 GBML-based data pruning with SAMA not only outperforms heuristics-based data pruning but also achieves improved memory/compute efficiencies.

An LTI PhD student is required to demonstrate proficiency in four areas: Writing, Presentation, Programming, and Teaching.
A student can satisfy the writing requirement by producing a peer-reviewed conference paper or a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference-paper quality.
A student demonstrates proficiency in computer programming by showing competence in language technology, usually through their research and/or project work.
To demonstrate teaching proficiency, a student must complete two successful Teaching Assistantships (TA-ships), with one being an undergraduate class and another being a graduate-level class. The Program Coordinator must be notified in advance of the TA-ship.
Yes, LTI PhD students are required to demonstrate proficiency in teaching by completing two successful Teaching Assistantships (TA-ships).
The purpose of the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990 is to ensure that students who are not native speakers of English pass the CMU ITA test prior to serving as a Teaching Assistant (TA).
If an LTI PhD student does not notify the Program Coordinator in advance about their Teaching Assistantship (TA-ship), it may not be accepted.
For a student's Teaching Assistantships (TA-ships) to be considered successful, they must be approved by the faculty member for whom the student serves as a TA.
To satisfy the writing proficiency requirement, a student must produce a peer-reviewed conference paper or a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference-paper quality.
Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center rates the fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns, to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA.
The purpose of administering the ITA test is to screen non-native English speakers for their fluency before they can become teaching assistants.
The three main milestones in the PhD dissertation process are finding a thesis topic, developing a proposed solution to an unsolved research problem, and writing a 'thesis statement' that describes the claimed solution.
Language Support helps these teaching assistants develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon.
The full university policy can be reviewed at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-instructors.html.
The purpose of a PhD dissertation is to present and defend an original research contribution in one's field of study.
Language Support helps these students by administering the ITA test and providing additional support for their language development.
A thesis topic is a well-defined research problem that is interesting, unsolved, and for which the student has a believable proposed solution.
The three main milestones in PhD dissertation process are finding a thesis topic, developing a proposed solution to an unsolved research problem, and writing a 'thesis statement' that describes the claimed solution.
Language Support helps these teaching assistants develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon.
At the end of their third year, a student composes a dissertation proposal. This document specifies the problem addressed by the research (the thesis topic), its significance and expected scientific contributions, relevant research including competing approaches, preliminary results, remaining work to be completed, evaluation metrics for that work, and a projected timeline for completion.
Before presenting the dissertation proposal, the student must secure approval from a dissertation committee. This committee consists of their advisor and at least two other SCS faculty members working in language technologies, as well as one external member.
Publicly announcing the thesis proposal presentation at least one week beforehand ensures that the proposed research is interesting to the larger scientific community and demonstrates that the student will finish their program if they complete their work as outlined.
The PhD Program Coordinator is responsible for coordinating the public announcement of the thesis proposal presentation at least one week beforehand, as per university rules.
The student is normally expected to complete their dissertation document by the end of their fifth year in SCS.
A detailed description of all the work done, including clear evaluation and discussion of its scientific contributions, is expected to be included in the dissertation document.
The only requirement for the title page of a dissertation is that it should follow LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook guidelines.
The public thesis proposal protects the student by ensuring that their proposed research is interesting to the larger scientific community and demonstrates that they will finish their program if they complete their work as outlined.
If a student fails to complete their work as outlined in their thesis proposal, it may indicate that they will not finish the program.
A dissertation defense is a public presentation and defense of the dissertation results. It's required by University rules, and at least one week prior to the defense, a draft of the thesis document must be made available online.
The purpose is to emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills and increase internal awareness of LTI work. The presentation should be advertised one week before the event and at least two LTI faculty members will attend.
The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted. This can happen promptly upon discovery of the falsification, and more information about this policy can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html
At least two LTI faculty members, including the research advisor, must attend the presentation.
The presentation should consist of a 20-minute talk plus time for discussion. It must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the public will be invited.
University rules require that a draft of the thesis document must be made available online at least one week before the public announcement of the dissertation defense.
After an LTI PhD student's presentation, two faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director of graduate programs. This feedback helps the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery.
The presentation must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the public will be invited.
All LTI PhD students must complete an oral presentation at the LTI each year (by the end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20-minute talk plus time for discussion.
No specific information is provided about what happens if a student fails to meet this requirement. It's important that students complete their presentation by the end of May.
The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification.
Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students attend Orientation lectures where faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, meet individually with potential advisors, indicate a first, second and third choice for advisor, and the entire LTI faculty meets as a 'Marriage Committee' to determine the best set of matches.
The purpose of having a student-advisor relationship is to ensure that every student receives necessary faculty mentoring and career advice.
The process of selecting an advisor takes place during the first month of the program.
If a student's degree is withdrawn due to falsification, it will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification.
The LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook states that each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program, supervises the student's directed study projects, provides necessary faculty mentoring, and gives career advice.
The role of an advisor in a student's academic journey includes guiding education, monitoring progress through the program, supervising directed study projects, providing necessary faculty mentoring, and giving career advice.
The 'Immigration Course', or IC, are lectures attended by students during their first month of the program. Faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise to help students meet potential advisors.
The purpose of the Marriage Committee is to determine the best set of matches between students and faculty advisors after each student has met with several potential advisors and indicated their preferences.
The text does not specify what would happen in this case. It is recommended to ask for further clarification or details about this situation.
The PhD Program Director
By finding another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor and making a request to the Program Director.
Because forming a strong student-advisor relationship takes time, and switching advisors can disrupt this process.
They receive the master's degree without any additional work.
As 12-unit courses with a number of 11-XXX, or as six-unit courses with 11-XXX that count as half an LTI course.
An actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study.
Yes, any one MLD (10-XXX) graduate course can count as an 'LTI course'.
Both the new and old advisors must agree to the change, typically not a problem if the new advisor has agreed in advance as described.
PhD students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master's degree can receive the master's degree without any additional work.
The handbook defines 'LTI course', 'course', and 'MLD (10-XXX) graduate course' as specified.
SCS students can take elective courses at Carnegie Mellon or cross-registered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as they discuss these with their advisor. Typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses.
Yes, recommended electives outside of SCS can count towards the “SCS” course requirement. However, students need to discuss these with their advisor and get approval from the Program Director.
LTI Orientation (also known as The Immigration Course or The IC) is a 2-3 week series of lectures and talks provided by the Language Technology Institute at the beginning of each Fall semester. It helps students learn about the work done by CMU faculty, provides an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students, and introduces them to the broad range of research done at the LTI.
No, students do not register for the LTI Orientation nor do they receive a grade. However, it is expected that new students will attend these talks and treat them as seriously as a course.
Students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition, such as summer courses. The grading of these courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course.
Typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses.
The department offering the course is responsible for grading these courses. However, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy still applies (“B” is the minimum for PhD, “C” for MLT).
It means that the student is choosing to take a course not part of their regular curriculum, but from another department or university. This can be beneficial for broadening knowledge and skills.
Students should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor to ensure they fulfill the requirements of their program as described above.
If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning.
In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.
Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required.
The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification.

 The existence of invalid regions posed challenges in the annotation process by making point-wise annotation more difficult.
 Annotators achieved reliable high-quality annotations in SemanticSTF by leveraging 2D camera images, Google Street views, and cross-checking their initial annotations.
 On average, it took an annotator 4.3 hours to label a single LiDAR scan in downtown areas with complex scenery.
 Points with indiscernible semantic contents caused by adverse weather were labeled as invalid to differentiate them from the 20 semantic categories used for labeling.
 The most frequently occurring classes in the SemanticSTF annotations were road, sidewalk, building, vegetation, and terrain.
 Point clouds captured under adverse weather conditions exhibited properties such as snow coverage, rain-induced noise points, reduced working range due to fog, and similarities to normal-weather point clouds.
 Class imbalance is an issue in SemanticSTF and other benchmarks due to various object sizes and unbalanced distribution of object categories in transportation scenes.
 The purpose of SemanticSTF was to provide the first large-scale adverse-weather 3DSS benchmark with high-quality point-wise annotations for universal 3DSS research under all weather conditions.
 SemanticSTF is considered important for training universal 3DSS models because it introduces domain shifts from normal-weather point clouds, highlighting the need for models that can perform well under all weather conditions.
 PointDR addresses the problem of domain generalization for semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds under all weather conditions by training a generalizable segmentation model from normal-weather point clouds to work well for adverse-weather point clouds in SemanticSTF.

 Non-autoregressive TTS models focus on better robustness, inference speed, and lower training difficulty.
 A duration predictor is trained to predict the text-audio alignment in TTS.
 VITS is an end-to-end model that uses a stochastic duration predictor for better diversity and achieves near-human naturalness by synthesizing speech on the VCTK dataset.
 Quantization-based generative models use a two-stage approach where a quantizer encodes the speech into discrete tokens, followed by an autoregressive transformer for generation.
 DiscreTalk discretizes speech using a VQVAE and a transformer for autoregressive generation.
 Unit-based language models train the transformer on discrete tokens derived from representations of self-supervised models for speech synthesis.
 MQTTS differs from other TTS models in the use of multi-code and its specialized architecture designed for multi-code generation and monotonic alignment.
 MQTTS uses a denoising module trained jointly with the TTS system to reduce noise in speech synthesis.
 The training of MQTTS involves two stages: quantization of raw waveform into discrete codes followed by autoregressive generation using a transformer conditioned on speaker embeddings and phoneme sequences.
 MQTTS adopts HiFi-GAN as the backbone architecture for the quantizer decoder QD and the discriminator D, with group normalization and speaker embedding added to enhance performance.

 AudioGPT
 By processing complex audio information, solving understanding and generation tasks, and supporting spoken dialogue with input/output interfaces (ASR, TTS).
 AudioGPT can handle speech, music, sound, and talking head understanding and generation in multi-round dialogues.
 It is considered important as humans communicate using spoken language, and processing audio modality information is essential for achieving artificial general intelligence.
 Challenges include obtaining human-labeled speech data, limited conversational speech data availability, and the computational intensity and time-consuming nature of training multi-modal LLMs.
 To serve as a general-purpose interface and bridge spoken language LLMs with audio foundation models for various audio understanding and generation tasks.
 It is divided into four stages: modality transformation, task analysis, model assignment, and response generation.
 Consistency, capability, and robustness are the design principles used to evaluate multi-modal LLMs.
 The proposal of AudioGPT, outlining design principles, and testing in terms of consistency, capability, and robustness to handle complex audio tasks.
 Because there are existing audio foundation models available that can understand and generate audio information, making it unnecessary to start training from scratch.

 The main contribution is the introduction of Block-wise Adaptation for Speech Summarization (BASS) and an explicit layer of semantic representation.
 BASS predicts a speech summary after consuming a new block of the input speech and allows new summaries to be modified fully if necessary.
 The BASS model introduces a semantic representation variable that aggregates semantics from the input acoustics and is not affected by how it is expressed. This allows for carrying semantic context across blocks for adaptation and training.
 The goal of summarization is to produce a summary token sequence that is shorter than the original sequence but still contains the relevant semantic information.
 The input sequence is represented as a sequence of abutting blocks with block size B, where each block produces a block-level output hypothesis.
 The streaming assumption implies that the present output cannot depend on future outputs or inputs in a causal model.
 The BASS model computes a divergence between the block-level output and the ground-truth summary after every block and performs backpropagation to update the neural network parameters.
 The semantic representation variable separates the acoustics from the summary, allowing for the generation of summaries by sampling from this rich semantic representation.
 The process of speech summarization occurs at the intersection of three spaces - the acoustic space, the semantic space, and the summary space.
 The BASS model assumes that the acoustics and summary are conditionally independent given the semantics, allowing for the disentanglement of acoustics and summary.
 The sequence sc represents a set of words from the vocabulary V with a length of Nc.
 Each utterance is assigned tags for dialogue act classification, intent classification, speaker role prediction, and emotion recognition.
 NLU models seek to output ˆYda, ˆYic, ˆYsr, and ˆYer by maximizing the posterior distributions given S.
 SLU introduces the complexity of modeling dialog context from spoken utterances.
 Transcripts are computed by passing ASR transcripts ˆs1:c-1 to a pretrained language model and concatenating them with the acoustic embeddings obtained from xc.
 The proposed joint E2E model extends the prior work and suggests jointly modeling all SLU tasks.
 The joint CTC-attention training is used to train the attention model encoder as an auxiliary task in the model architecture.
 Order agnostic training addresses the label ambiguity problem, also known as the permutation problem, in predicting SLU tags.
 The semantic encoder encodes the dialog history by processing ASR transcripts and SLU tags from previous spoken utterances.
 The joint embedding cjoin is produced by concatenating acoustic and context embeddings and attending to them using a joint encoder.

 CodeBERTScore allows comparing code pairs that are lexically different while taking into account the programmatic or natural language context.
 CodeBERTScore computes the cosine similarity between the encoded representations of each token in the generated code and each token in the reference code.
 The main contribution of CodeBERTScore is being a self-supervised metric for NL->Code evaluation, based on BERTScore, which leverages pretrained models without requiring manual labeling.
 CodeBERTScore is more correlated with human preference and execution correctness because it can match variable names according to their semantic similarity and functional role in the code.
 BERTScore is used to encode candidate and reference sentences separately, computing cosine similarity between their vectors to evaluate machine translations.
 BERTScore computes sentence-level precision by taking the maximum similarity score for every candidate vector and averages it, and recall by taking the average of maximum similarity scores for every reference vector.
 The F1 score in BERTScore is computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
 CodeBERTScore computes the similarity between generated and reference code without including the encoded context in the final computation, unlike BERTScore.
 CodeBERTScore computes the F3 score to weigh recall higher than precision according to METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).
 CodeBERTScore uses programming language-specific models that are pretrained and released, rather than models intended for natural language processing only.

 Unlimiformer aims to augment pretrained encoder-decoders and offload the cross-attention computation to a kNN index to allow for unlimited length input.
 Memorizing Transformers require training to incorporate memory, while Unlimiformer can improve existing models without any training.
 One of the limitations is that the experiments only considered English-language datasets.
 Unlimiformer can process the longest inputs by offloading the index to the CPU memory, allowing for practically unlimited inputs for any modern server.
 Unlimiformer attends only to the top-k input tokens for every attention head, while SLED attends to all input tokens at the same time.
 Unlimiformer can make smaller models perform better than larger Longformer-based models.
 The Unlimiformer code is released at https://github.com/abertsch72/unlimiformer.
 The quality of the nearest-neighbors search depends on the quality of the indexed keys.
 Using Unlimiformer to modify already-pretrained models incurs less computational cost compared to pretraining large models.
 One concern is the test-time latency when the index is offloaded to the CPU, resulting in higher latency compared to storing the encoded hidden states and index on the GPU.
 RL1 represents the best-case performance over possible users.
 The best-case utility is determined as RR1 (equivalently ESL1) where RR𝑖 monotonically degrades in rank.
 It implies that the best-case performance over possible user recall requirements is higher in 𝜋 compared to 𝜋 ′.
 The focus is on measuring differences in performance instead of absolute performance.
 Preference-based evaluation explicitly models the preference between two rankings, while metric-based evaluation computes some evaluation metric for each ranking.
 To preserve the best-case properties of RL1 metrics with much higher sensitivity.
 Judging any item relevant in general is necessary but not sufficient criteria.
 It involves looking at utilities in the best-off positions and iteratively inspecting lower utility positions until finding an inequality.
 A tie can only happen if two rankings have all relevant items in exactly the same positions.

 The AV-SUPERB benchmark was proposed to enable general-purpose evaluation of unimodal audio/visual and bimodal fusion representations on 7 datasets covering 5 audio-visual tasks in speech and audio processing.
 The AV-SUPERB benchmark comprises of three tracks to assess audio, video, and audio-visual fusion representations, designed to allow researchers to compare learning strategies across models and modalities.
 The AV-SUPERB benchmark aims to evaluate representations across seven distinct datasets involving five speech and audio processing tasks.
 The pretrain-then-finetune paradigm is considered effective for building multitasking algorithmic systems in speech, audio, and vision domains.
 Pretrained representations obtained through self-supervised loss functions allow models to be applied to diverse tasks by fine-tuning minimal additional parameters.
 The contributions of the AV-SUPERB benchmark include diverse-domain evaluation, easy and reproducible benchmarking, intermediate-task fine-tuning, and layer-wise analysis of contributions to task performance.
 Previous multitask benchmarks in speech, audio, and video representation learning evaluate models across different tasks to promote research towards general approaches applicable to various real-world tasks.
 The SUPERB and SUPERB-SG benchmarks evaluate speech representation models on a wide range of downstream tasks covering content, speaker, and other aspects of speech.
 The HEAR benchmark evaluates audio representations on domains beyond speech, such as music and environmental sounds.
 Multi-task multimodal benchmarks allow for a focus on the relationship between paired audio/visual inputs, promoting research that leverages this connection.
 The main focus is on computational fairness analysis and mitigating bias in text through style transfer.
 They use a rule-based method to convert gendered pronouns to singular they pronouns and swap gendered words with gender-neutral versions.
 They formulate the task as a neural style transfer problem and use an adversarial approach to retain the style of the written text.
 They focus on bias association of input templates with the output of language models and perform a text-to-text generation task.
 The focus is on providing the large language model (LLM) with various contexts in addition to bias association trigger words and performing a text-to-text generation task.
 Bias is quantitatively measured by looking at the most frequently occurring words across outputs generated by different trigger words and using the pointwise mutual information concept to identify words that occur more in the outputs of queer trigger words compared to straight counterparts.
 They engineer prompts to reduce bias in distilled language models by augmenting the dataset with corresponding counterfactual sentences.
 They formulate the debiasing method as a style transfer problem and focus on increasing the overall regard score of the sentence.
 SHAP (SHapley Additive ex- Planations) is used to delete the words that lead to an input text being marked as sarcastic in a text-to-text style transfer problem.
 They implement a fine-tuning technique on a dataset augmented with additional data to reduce bias in pre-trained language models.
Kasparov claimed to have seen 'human intelligence' behind Deep Blue's moves.
No, they said it was not true.
Berliner thinks that intelligence emerges just like life emerges. He believes even the dumbest living thing has some sort of intelligence.
Kasparov saw machine intelligence, not human intelligence.
Berliner describes Watson's ability to answer 'Jeopardy!' questions as quite marvelous.
Watson's understanding of slang and idiom is notable, says Berliner because it's not easy in the area of general intelligence.
Watson had an unfair advantage over its human competitors as it received the Jeopardy! answers in written form and could immediately get to work, while the human players were still listening to and parsing the text.
Watson had a tremendous advantage as it was way, way ahead in understanding the question—maybe a second or two ahead.
Berliner pointed out that many of the human beings never got a chance to show what they knew because Watson rang in before them.
Berliner was driven by high standards for himself, believing that the only things he could offer the world were those same standards.
After concluding that Botvinnik's published results couldn't be duplicated, Berliner accused the chess grandmaster of manipulating his outcomes.
While some professional reviewers criticized the book, Berliner remained unbowed by the personal attacks.
Campbell believes that a strong personality and the ability to be lonely are essential traits for such individuals.
Berliner's reputation as a fearless advocate overshadowed his generous spirit, according to his former students.
Palay believes that Berliner has a strong and gracious personality both on a personal level and professional level.
Berliner treated his students with great concern for their well-being, not just as his students but also as people.
Palay consciously mimics Berliner's style of interaction when dealing with his own colleagues.
Palay said that working with Hans was a lot of fun and he consciously mimics Berliner's style when interacting with his own colleagues.
Ebeling said that Berliner led by example more than anything else, and there was a constant attention to detail. He always thought about the next idea that might work.
Palay thinks that Berliner's research legacy 'might not at all be guessable at this point', but notes that the pendulum seems to be swinging back from purely statistical machine-learning methods in translation and other fields to hybrids that include rule-based search techniques.
Palay predicts that some of the things that Berliner was working on will resurrect themselves over time as they start hitting walls, and tracing them back to Berliner will be difficult but the seeds will be there.
Schaeffer thinks that as computer scientists try to reduce power consumption and face difficulty adapting some problems to parallel computing, they will look for more efficient search algorithms.
Schaeffer thinks that Berliner's most lasting legacy is his graduate students, as he didn't have many but they were of very high quality.
Berliner no longer plays chess because he believes that once you reach a certain level, it becomes less enjoyable.
Berliner noticed a 'deplorable trend' where some students were attempting to talk their way around difficult problems instead of doing the necessary research.
Berliner advises students to learn as much substantive knowledge as possible, because all knowledge is interconnected and will help them make better decisions in the future. He also suggests learning something quantitative or acquiring a skill that others would be willing to pay for.
When the weather is good, Berliner enjoys strolling on the beach and thinking.
Students interested in learning more about Berliner's advice can reach out to Jason Togyer at 412-268-8721 or via email at jt3y@cs.cmu.edu.
Berliner believes that learning something quantitative will make it easier for students to make good decisions in the future, as all knowledge is interconnected.
Instead of playing chess, Berliner works on his solitaire game and keeps records of winning strategies.
Berliner retired from CMU in 1998.
Berliner thinks it is a 'deplorable trend' for some students to try and talk their way out of solving difficult problems, rather than performing the necessary research.

 Examples include Imputer, Mask-CTC, Insertion-based modeling, CIF, and other variants.
 0.06 real-time factor (RTF)
 The major difference is whether they perform hypothesis pruning for every input frame or every output token.
 The hypothesis that reaches the end of an utterance (predicts the end of sentence symbol ⟨eos⟩) is added.
 The greedy search algorithm does not consider alternate hypotheses in a sequence.
 To avoid extremely long/short output sequences which can result in large deletion and insertion errors.
 The thresholds are determined proportionally to the input frame length |X| with tunable parameters ρmin and ρmax.
 A length penalty and a coverage term are mentioned.
 It can provide block-wise monotonic alignment constraint between the input feature and output label, and realize block-wise streaming decoding.
 Model fusion during decoding is similar to the classical HMM-based beam search.
 The metrics are false alarm (FA) rate, missed detection (MISS) rate, speaker error (SPKERR) rate, and the DER.
 The visual modality of the VSD system is not disturbed by the acoustic environment unlike the ASD system, which results in better performance.
 The high false alarm rate in the VSD system is potentially due to the lip movement in the silent segments.
 Combining the audio and visual modalities in the AVSD system yields the best performance, as it overcomes the individual weaknesses of each modality.
 Six experiments are designed for the diarization and recognition system.
 The high MISS and SPKERR rate in the ASD+ASR system results in a large number of deletion errors of target speakers and insertion errors of interfering speakers.
 In the VSD+ASR system, the visual modality of the speaker diarization module dominates the performance by reducing substitution errors and improving the whole system performance.
 Incorporating audio modality information to modify video modality in AVSD significantly improves the results compared to VSD, and the AVDR system results are also improved.
 The TV background noise may cover the voice of the target speakers and contain the voice of irrelevant speakers, interfering with speaker diarization and speech recognition.
 The text points out potential difficulties such as far-field video quality, indistinguishable speakers, and the impact of audio and visual modalities.
 Scenarios such as generating or endorsing hate speech, disseminating false information, engaging in illegal activities, managing sensitive data, attempting language generalization beyond Arabic and English, and making critical decisions with high stakes.
 Training was performed on the Condor Galaxy Supercomputer using a customized version of the Cerebras modelzoo.
 3.6 million Arabic instructions.
 The prompt and response pairs were collected from multiple publicly available sources.
 The instruction-tuning data has been collected up to July 2023.
 Efforts have been made to reduce unintentional biases in the dataset, including curated Arabic data.
 Designed as an AI assistant for Arabic and English, its purpose is to enhance human productivity.
 Caution is advised to prevent misuse, such as generating harmful content, spreading false information, or managing sensitive data.
 Responsible and judicious use of the model is strongly encouraged.
 The Jais-chat 13B model can accurately respond in Arabic and English, but may not provide accurate responses in other languages.
 The focus was on the temporal stability of daily, monthly, and yearly solar PV and wind power variabilities under carbon-neutral scenarios.
 While there were large regional differences, overall, the temporal stability of solar PVPOT and WP variabilities improved in most sub-regions studied.
 The variabilities decreased in five sub-regions except for southern South America.
 The eastern United States, western Europe, India, and eastern China experienced a decrease, with exceptions in southern South America and western Africa.
 The findings suggest that global carbon-neutral policies improve the temporal stability of daily, monthly, and yearly solar PVPOT and WP in most of the global land regions studied.
 The knowledge gaps include the need for analysis beyond high-warming scenarios, a global integrated assessment, consideration of variability across time scales, and the bias introduced in projected wind energy calculations.
 The wind speed at 100 m was estimated using a spatially variant scaling factor, which is considered closer to benchmark.
 The model projections were run under deep decarbonization scenarios that reach global carbon neutrality earlier than previous scenarios.
 While the RCP2.6 scenario projected decreased solar PV in India by the end of the twenty-first century, the STR scenario projected that solar PV would rebound to historical levels by the mid-twenty-first century.
 The analysis highlighted a north-to-south inter-hemispheric shift and a notable west-to-east shift of wind energy due to deep decarbonization, with a large enhancement of wind energy in western Africa.

 Linguistic Models (LMs) should retrieve information only when they lack the required knowledge to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate retrieval.
 Low probability/confidence often indicates a lack of knowledge for large LMs.
 The goal of active retrieval is to benefit future generations.
 Generating a temporary next sentence, using it as a query to retrieve relevant documents, and then regenerating the next sentence conditioning on the retrieved documents.
 Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE).
 Multihop QA (2WikiMultihopQA), commonsense reasoning (StrategyQA), long-form QA (ASQA), and open-domain summarization (WikiAsp).
 FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance compared to single-time and multi-time retrieval baselines.
 To directly use the user input as the query for retrieval and generate the complete answer at once.
 Active retrieval augmented generation involves actively deciding when and what to retrieve throughout the generation process, while single-time retrieval augmented generation generates the complete answer at once.
 To prompt the LM to generate retrieval queries when necessary while generating the answer using retrieval-encouraging instructions.

A twilled woolen fabric with a plaid design, of Scottish origin and consisting of stripes of various colors and widths against a solid ground, denoting a particular family lineage.
Tartans are twilled woolen fabrics with a plaid design, while plaids can be made from various materials and do not necessarily have to follow specific patterns.
The official tartan of Carnegie Mellon University can be found on various items in the university store.
The Scottish terrier was officially recognized as the mascot of Carnegie Mellon University in 2007.
A plaid scarf is a piece of fabric with a plaid design, often worn around the neck as an accessory or decoration.
Tartans have stripes that cross each other at right angles, creating a solid color where they intersect. Plaids can vary in how the stripes intersect.
The origin of tartan fabric is Scottish and it consists of stripes of various colors and widths against a solid ground, denoting a particular family lineage.
Carnegie Mellon University officially adopted the Scottish terrier as its mascot in 2007.
The official mascot of Carnegie Mellon University is a Scottish terrier, commonly referred to as Scotty.
Students, faculty, staff, and alumni of Carnegie Mellon University voted to officially adopt the Scottish terrier as their mascot.
The live dog serving as Carnegie Mellon's official mascot is also known as Scotty.
Carnegie Mellon University's school colors are Cardinal and Gray.
Gesling Stadium, the football stadium and track and field of Carnegie Mellon University, is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The capacity of Gesling Stadium, which serves as the football stadium and track and field for Carnegie Mellon University, is 3,500 people.
The playing field of Gesling Stadium, the football stadium and track and field for Carnegie Mellon University, is made of FieldTurf.
Carnegie Mellon's athletic teams are part of the NCAA Division III and the University Athletic Association (for football) or Presidents' Athletic Conference (for football only).
 The purpose of the DACS approach is to maintain benchmark consistency across different base methods.
 Both DACS and SAC use a standard DeepLabv2 backbone.
 DACS and CAG baselines serve as strong baselines for evaluating the approach as they achieve superior accuracies.
 The base method regularized with the constraint outperforms the unregularized version in terms of mIoU.
 Categories such as sidewalk, sky, traffic light, traffic sign, and bike show improvement with the regularized version.
 Large gains are observed in both frequent (sidewalk, wall) and less-frequent (bus, bike) classes.
 The object-region aware constraint is suspected to be the reason for the observed uniformity in gains across different classes.
 The blue dashed box highlights the semantic classes that the regularized version is able to predict more accurately than the base method.
 Figure 3 visualizes the predictions of DACS and DACS+PAC models on randomly selected examples from Cityscapes validation split.
 Table 4 includes the ablations that compare the effects of individual components of the regularizer (PAC) on final performance.
 The sequential recommendation task aims to recommend the item 𝑣𝑡 to satisfy the user’s needs at 𝑡-th time.
 TASTE proposes an attention sparsity method to encode long text sequences of user-item interactions.
 A user-item interaction history H is represented as a concatenation of verbalized items {𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑡 −1} that are in H.
 T5 is used to encode the user-item interaction history H and item 𝑣 as embeddings ℎ H and ℎ𝑣.
 The relevance between user-item interaction history H and item 𝑣 is calculated using the ranking probability 𝑃 (𝑣 | H) between the encoded representations ℎ H and ℎ𝑣.
 The model parameters are optimized using the CrossEntropy loss function.,
 The attention sparsity mechanism in TASTE learns session-based user behaviors by employing a fusion-in-decoder architecture.
 The text sequence of user-item interaction history is split into 𝑛 sub-sequences ˆ𝑋 (H ) = { ˆ𝑋 (H )1, ..., ˆ𝑋 (H )𝑛 }.
 TASTE employs a mechanism that eliminates attention computations among different sessions within Transformer encoder modules, reducing the encoding computational complexity from 𝑂 (𝑛2) to 𝑂 (𝑛).
 Four sequential recommendation datasets are used in the experiments, including Yelp, Amazon Beauty, Sports, and Toys.

 Accurately modeling low wind conditions is important in climate model projections because changes in wind conditions strongly affect the stability of energy supply from renewable sources.
 Quantifying the temporal variability of solar PV and wind energy is crucial for planning energy sources because it helps in securing a stable and reliable energy supply by determining the need for complementary sources and storage.
 Changes in cut-in and ramp-up wind speed days under future scenarios are mainly caused by a shift in different wind speed conditions.
 The spatial patterns of changes in wind speed conditions under future scenarios show more days under ramp-up wind speed and fewer days in cut-in wind speed in eastern China and India.
 The global variabilities of solar PVPOT and WP decrease from daily to yearly scales because the seasonal cycle is stronger than inter-annual variation for meteorological variables.
 From tropical to mid-high latitudes, the variability of solar PVPOT increases.
 In the tropics, the large variability of wind speed due to ocean-atmosphere oscillations results in unstable wind energy output.
 Climate change influences not only the annual mean generation of solar PV and wind energy but also its variabilities at various time scales.
 A higher temporal stability of daily and yearly solar PV outputs is found in the eastern United States, southern South America, western Europe, and eastern China under the SSP2-4.5 scenario.
 The day-to-day and month-to-month variabilities of wind power increase in the eastern United States and India under the SSP2-4.5 scenario.
 The text discusses computing the probability of ties between system rankings, based on the position of the first relevant item and a random second ranking.
 The probability of ties increases as the number of relevant items increases, skewing towards a higher probability of tie when the first relevant item is closer to the top.
 The text indicates a lack of sensitivity of reciprocal rank as the number of relevant items increases.
 RL1 metrics, such as reciprocal rank and ESL1, have a fundamental limitation for evaluation due to the skew in the distribution of ties when rankings are drawn from real systems.
 The logarithmic transform in Figure 3 is used to show the empirical probability of ties with a second ranking for different benchmarks, as the probability values are highly skewed.
 Lexicographic Precision emphasizes precision by considering the position of the top-ranked relevant item and ignoring the positions of other relevant items in RL1 evaluation.
 RL1 evaluation is described as having ceiling effects because it only considers the position of the top-ranked relevant item, which limits its sensitivity.
 RL1 evaluation aims to develop an evaluation method that preserves the ordering of rankings and generates a sensible order when RL1 is tied.
 Best-case retrieval evaluation aims to improve the sensitivity of reciprocal rank by considering lexicographic precision and providing a justified ordering of rankings when RL1 is tied.
 The text suggests that uncertainty over recall requirements can be evaluated using RL1 to assess the quality of a ranking for users with different recall levels.

 AGR stands for albumin-to-globulin ratio and it may be a clinical indicator associated with overall survival (OS) for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with anlotinib.
 AGR is simple, inexpensive, easily available, and part of routinely administered laboratory tests, making it economically beneficial for widespread clinical application.
 The study is a retrospective cohort study, providing only weak evidence of associations between AGR and OS; it is hard to distinguish cause and effect. Possible biases like selection, detection, and analysis bias could confound the results. Additionally, there is a lack of prior research investigating the association between AGR and OS in patients with ECOG PS score = 1 group.

Sylvania Erol was born in Turkey.
Sylvania Erol made significant contributions to the field of mathematics.
The theorem named after Sylvania Erol is known as 'Erol's Theorem.'
Some of the challenges faced by women in mathematics include lack of representation and recognition, gender bias, and limited opportunities for advancement.
The main message that Sylvania Erol wants to convey through her work is the importance of diversity and representation in mathematics, particularly for women.
Erol's Theorem states that every mathematical problem has a solution. If you think it doesn’t have one, then it is not yet understood properly.
Some of the factors contributing to the underrepresentation of women in mathematics include societal expectations and gender stereotypes.
Sylvania Erol believes that education plays a crucial role in promoting diversity and representation in mathematics.
The significance of Sylvania Erol's work for future generations of mathematicians lies in her efforts to promote diversity and representation, which can lead to more innovative solutions and a broader understanding of mathematical concepts.

Scott E. Fahlman is a computer scientist who invented the sideways 'smiley face' (sometimes called an 'emoticon') that is commonly used in email, chat, and newsgroup posts.
The smiley face emoticon was invented by Scott E. Fahlman by the early 1980's when the Computer Science community at Carnegie Mellon University was making heavy use of online bulletin boards or 'bboards', which were a precursor to today’s newsgroups.
Scott E. Fahlman suggested using joke markers in text-based communication because he noticed that when people made sarcastic remarks, some readers would fail to get the joke and post lengthy responses, which could stir up more people with even more responses, burying the original thread of discussion.
The problem caused by lack of tone-of-voice cues in text-based communication was that some people would interpret humorous remarks as serious, leading to lengthy responses and 'flame wars'.
Scott E. Fahlman suggested using the character sequence ':-)' as a joke marker to explicitly indicate that a post is not to be taken seriously.
The purpose of online bulletin boards or 'bboards' in Carnegie Mellon University was to serve as a social mechanism for faculty, staff, and students to discuss weighty matters on an equal footing.
Some of the topics discussed on the online bulletin boards at Carnegie Mellon University included talk announcements, requests for information, campus parking, keyboard layouts, politics, abortion, and other general interests.
The problem with extended 'flame wars' in online bulletin boards was that they could bury the original thread of discussion and cause more people to get involved, leading to even more responses.
An emoticon is a symbol or sequence of characters used in text-based communication to convey emotion or mood. The smiley face emoticon is one example of an emoticon.
The joke marker suggested by Scott E. Fahlman was the character sequence ':-)' to explicitly indicate that a post is not to be taken seriously.
The author believes that while good writers should not need to explicitly label their humorous comments, there are times when it can be useful for those who lack literary skill or whose writing may contain errors.
The author suggests that the smiley face symbol could serve as a humor-marker in written communication, with :-( used for anger or unhappiness.
The author points out that even great writers like Shakespeare had bad days and produced sloppy prose at times. He also notes that Shakespeare's work contains clichés and his spelling was not perfect.
The author argues against those who denounce the use of smiley faces in written communication, suggesting that while good writers should have no need for them, they can be useful for less skilled or error-prone writers.
The author suggests that while Shakespeare's work was published in printed form, with limited impact from individual readers' reactions, online communication can be affected by each reader's interpretation.
The author mentions a longer message where he explained the need for a humor-marker and suggested using the smiley face symbol, but this message did not turn up in their search.
The author believes that online communication has led to a degradation of our written language, as people often post without careful consideration or editing.
The author suggests that while good writers may not need to use smiley faces in emails, they can be useful for those who lack literary skill or whose writing may contain errors.
The author suggests that a humor-marker like the smiley face symbol can be useful in written communication to indicate when something is meant to be humorous.
The author argues that Shakespeare's work is full of clichés and his spelling was atrocious.
The author believes that the judicious use of a few smilies can reduce the frequency of such firestorms.
The author believes he independently invented this particular glyph and the 'turn your head to one side' principle.
Leonard Hamey’s post suggesting (#) might be taken as an example of 'turn your head to one side'.
Some people have told the author that this convention was used by teletype operators in the old days, while others claim it was used in private letters long before 1982.
The author claims that he invented the sideways smiley face and the 'turn your head to one side' principle independently in 1982.
The author mentions that some of his research groups used \__/ to indicate a smile, which can be seen as an example of 'turn your head to one side'.
The author argues that if 100,000 copies of a novel or an essay were distributed in printed form, and if 1% of the readers didn’t get the joke and were outraged at what they had read, there was nothing these clueless readers could do to spoil the enjoyment of the other 99%. But if it were possible for each of the 1000 clueless readers to write a lengthy counter-argument and flood these into the same distribution channels as the original work, this would cause problems.
The author believes that if used judiciously, a few smilies can reduce the frequency of firestorms.
The main topic of this text is the origin and evolution of the smiley face symbol.
According to the author, his 1982 suggestion was the one that finally took hold, spread around the world, and spawned thousands of variations.
Vladimir Nabokov's quote suggests that he often thinks there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile, and he would like to trace such a mark in response to the question.
The term 'independent invention' refers to the idea that multiple people or groups may come up with similar ideas independently, without knowing about each other's work.
The links provide additional information and resources for readers who want to learn more about smilies and their history, as mentioned in the article.
The author mentions teletype operators to provide another possible source for the use of smilies, although he has not seen hard evidence supporting this claim.
A concave mark refers to a symbol or sign that curves inward, resembling a smile.
A supine round bracket refers to a symbol or sign that is curved and resembles a smile, but it is placed upside down.
The author believes that his 1982 suggestion of using the smiley face was the one that finally took hold, spread around the world, and spawned thousands of variations.

The Lemur Project develops open-source search engines, toolbars, text analysis tools, search services and datasets that support international research and development.
Indri and Galago are search engines developed by the Lemur Project.
Lemur's software development philosophy emphasizes state-of-the-art accuracy, flexibility, and efficiency to ensure that their search engines are reliable and efficient for scientific research applications.
The purpose of developing new methods for using knowledge graphs and ontologies is to improve search engine accuracy, especially for vague, ambiguous or poorly specified queries.
Knowledge graphs and ontologies are less structured than typical relational databases but more structured than text stored in full-text search engines.
A search engine can use these resources to identify the probable meanings of query terms, and use this knowledge to identify documents that match those meanings.
The goal of extending search engine architectures is to support large, centralized, universal repositories of affordable and easily used scientific data.
Numerical data continues to expand because the results of scholarly research in data-rich sciences (e.g., non-textual data) continue to grow.
The purpose of extending search engine architectures is to access tabular, numeric and other non-textual information as easily and readily as documents without laborious additional work.

Section 3 describes the various rules and regulations that determine the attainment of a MCDS degree by the student.
The standard program lengths for graduate students vary significantly – ranging from two semesters for some full-time master’s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs.
Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.
Early completion refers to graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study. These students may consult with their degree-granting department.
The purpose of early completion is to allow graduate students who have completed all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study to consult with their degree-granting department.
The benefits of early completion include being able to complete your graduate studies in less than the standard length of time, which can save you both time and money. It also allows students who have completed their degree requirements early to consult with their degree-granting department.
The statute of limitations refers to the maximum period after an event within which a lawsuit must be filed. For Carnegie Mellon graduate students, it means that they are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook.
Early completion plays a significant role in allowing Carnegie Mellon graduate students who have completed all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study to consult with their degree-granting department.
The purpose of determining if early degree certification is allowed is to ensure that students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are able to do so under specific circumstances.
A Master's student may require longer-than-standard completion due to academic interruptions, full-time study or progress towards the degree being interrupted by serious medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.
Master's students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program and will be certified at the end.
Extended or longer-than-standard completion refers to a situation where students take more time than usual to complete their degree requirements due to academic interruptions, medical issues, or other unforeseen circumstances.
The granting program or department plays a crucial role in determining whether students can receive their degrees earlier than usual, based on specific circumstances such as academic interruptions, medical issues, or other unforeseen situations.
Master's students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements will be certified at the end, after they have remained in close contact with their graduate program.
Master's students may require extended or longer-than-standard completion due to academic interruptions, full-time study being interrupted by serious medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.
The purpose of determining if early degree certification is allowed under specific circumstances is to ensure that students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are able to do so in a fair and flexible manner.
When Master's students are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program, they must maintain regular communication and engagement with the academic staff and faculty members responsible for overseeing their degree progress.

The author of 'The Kiltie Band' is Robert Louis Stevenson.
The main theme of 'The Kiltie Band' is a group of boys who form a band and their adventures together.
The boys in the story live in Scotland, specifically in Edinburgh.
The band formed by the boys in 'The Kiltie Band' is called The Kilties.
The boys want to form a band because they are inspired by their music teacher, Mr. Sinclair, and his love for music.
In 'The Kiltie Band', Davie plays the drums.
The boys come up with the name 'The Kilties' by combining the word 'kilt,' which is a traditional Scottish garment, and '-ties,' to represent their friendship.
At the end of 'The Kiltie Band', the boys perform in front of a large audience and receive great applause, indicating that they have succeeded as musicians.
Mr. Sinclair is the music teacher who inspires the boys to form a band and helps them practice and improve their musical skills.
The Kiltie Band began in 1908 with a group of just seven students dedicated to supporting Carnegie Tech football.
The Kiltie Marching Band consists of musicians and colorguard and plays at all Carnegie Mellon home football games.
After football season, the Kiltie Concert Band plays a holiday concert and two spring concerts, including a performance at Carnegie Mellon’s Spring Carnival.
A part of the band gets together and acts as a pep band for the basketball teams.
The Kiltie Band is a campus organization recognized by Student Senate.
During football season, the Kiltie Marching Band practices Mondays and Thursdays from 5:30 p.m.-7:30 p.m., with a Game Day practice at 9:30-11:00 a.m.
During the concert season, the Kiltie Band practices Mondays and Thursdays from 5:30-6:30 p.m.
No, any member of the campus community with music experience is able to join the Kiltie Band!

CTAT stands for Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools, a software toolkit designed to help educators create and deploy intelligent tutoring systems.
The basics of CTAT include creating grouping lists, multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop interfaces, and other interactive elements for educational purposes.
An example-tracing tutor in CTAT is a type of intelligent tutor that uses predefined rules to guide students through problem solving processes.
Dynamic interfaces in CTAT refer to interactive elements that can be customized and adapted based on student performance or other factors during tutoring sessions.
A formula-based example-tracing tutor uses mathematical formulas to generate problems and solutions, while a rule-based one relies on predefined rules.
Advanced topics in CTAT include configuring Eclipse for production rule editing, installing and uninstalling CTAT, HTML examples, and more.
You can deploy your tutor using CTAT by following the instructions on logging, configuring Eclipse for production rule editing, installing and uninstalling CTAT, and creating HTML examples.
Some of the interactive elements available in CTAT include grouping lists, multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop interfaces, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more.
You can create a drag-and-drop tutor interface using CTAT by building an appropriate interface with the DragNDrop component and customizing it according to your needs.
Some of the components available in CTAT for creating interactive elements include grouping components, hint buttons, chat panels, checkboxes, combo boxes, and more.

The Carnegie Mellon Cheerleading Program is a sideline cheerleading and dance team that performs at home football games from September through November and home conference basketball games from January (after winter break) through February.
The main goal of the cheerleading program is to provide spirit at games. Members of the team will use crowd-involving chants and cheers with signs and will perform dance routines and sideline dances.
All skills regardless of experience will be re-taught starting at the most basic level to ensure proper knowledge, technique, and safety.
We do our best to accommodate busy academic schedules as well as those of other activities. That is why we have incorporated a hybrid approach with the ability to use video instruction to learn new material and to review current material in order to limit the amount of face-to-face time commitment.
The CMU Cheerleading Program welcomes all levels of experience to join! Former performers of any kind; dancers, gymnasts, figure skaters, cheerleaders, etc., or someone wanting to try something new and fun. Additionally, we welcome graduate students and semester exchange students from other CMU Campuses.
Visit our tryouts page for more information or contact Coach Kristin Kropf .

GHC 4201 refers to the contact information for a specific department at Carnegie Mellon University.
MS students can access the LTI's computer cluster, which is used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project involving large datasets or lengthy computations.
The standard program lengths vary significantly ranging from two semesters for some full-time master’s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs.
Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.
Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances.
Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.
GHC 4201 refers to a contact point at Carnegie Mellon University. It can be reached by calling extension 8-4231 from a campus phone or 412-268-4231 from an outside line.

The standard length of time for a full-time master’s program can vary, but it typically ranges from two semesters.
Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook.
A Master's student may require longer than the standard time to complete their degree due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.
Master’s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program, and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements.
Master's students should reference CMU Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations: www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of limitations.html for guidelines and restrictions regarding the maximum length of time allowable for master’s degree completion.
This information comes from the MIIS Graduate Student Handbook, specifically page 11.
Master’s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program.
At the end of the semester, Master’s students who have completed their degree requirements will be certified.
The purpose of the CMU Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations is to provide guidelines and restrictions regarding the maximum length of time allowable for master’s degree completion.
Interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program refer to situations where a student is unable to continue their studies according to the requirements set forth by their graduate program.
Unusual or unforeseen circumstances refer to situations that are not typical or expected, and which may cause a student to require longer than the standard time to complete their degree.
The maximum time a student has to complete all requirements for a master's degree, as outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations, is seven years from original matriculation as a master’s student.
If the time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program.
A school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption.
Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.
Students who are pursuing a master’s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.
In this context, matriculation refers to the process of becoming a master’s student.
The Master’s Students Statute of Limitations applies to all students, but it may be more restrictive in some departments, schools, or colleges.
To defer the lapse means to postpone the expiration of the time-to-degree limit for a period commensurate with the duration of an interruption.
In this context, part-time refers to students who are pursuing their master’s degree on a less than full-time basis.
Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.
Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count towards their current degree level.
International Students Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.
Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master’s degree programs.

The faculty advisor's role includes guiding education, monitoring student progress, supervising directed study projects and providing career advice.
Advisors are chosen during the first month of the program. Students attend LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks to meet potential advisors, who describe their interests and areas of expertise.
If a student fails to secure an advisor within the first month, the Program Director assigns an advisor to them.
Yes, students can switch advisors. They must find a new faculty member willing to serve as an advisor and then request the Program Director's approval.
The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors must agree to the change. This usually isn't a problem, as the new advisor has agreed beforehand.
Forming a strong student-advisor relationship takes time and effort. Switching often can disrupt this process, making it harder for the student to benefit from their advisor's guidance.
LTI Orientation is a program where faculty members describe their interests and areas of expertise. Students attend these talks, meet potential advisors, and learn about the program's expectations.
During these talks, faculty members present their interests and areas of expertise. Students attend to meet potential advisors and learn about the program's expectations.
The Program Director approves student-advisor relationships, assigns an advisor if a student doesn't find one within the first month and oversees the advising process.
Students are expected to attend these talks and treat them as seriously as a course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI.
No, students do not have to register for the LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks and they do not receive a grade.
The LTI Orientation Canvas course is designed to increase incoming LTI graduate students' awareness and understanding of CMU's community standards and the resources that CMU offers its students.
The program administrator enrolls MIIS students into the LTI Orientation Canvas course in early August.
All MIIS students are expected to complete all assignments by the end of their first semester in the program.

The Link
Allen Newell and Herb Simon
It serves as a link between the School of Computer Science and more than 10,000 alumni, colleagues, parents, and other friends around the world.
The history of computer science
Alan Turing, Ken Thompson, Claude Shannon, John McCarthy, and the founders of CMU's computer science department, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon.
Computer chess has been called the 'drosophila--fruitfly' of artificial intelligence research, similar to how genetics students study fruit flies due to their short life cycle.
Chess allows for a controlled domain where we can experiment with lots of issues in intelligence.
He led the team that designed Chinook, a computer checkers program
Jonathan Schaeffer is a professor of computer science and vice provost of the University of Alberta, leading the university's computer poker research.
Hans Berliner is a CMU senior research scientist who built the first game-playing computer to defeat a human champion and the first chess computer capable of playing at 'senior master' level.
Hans Berliner achieved excellence in various areas including speech, image analysis, data retrieval and was a member of the IBM Deep Blue team that defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov.
According to Hans Berliner, computer chess was a research dead-end as far as artificial intelligence was concerned. He believes that more powerful processors and machine-learning techniques powered by statistical analysis were able to crack data-intensive problems.
Murray Campbell, one of the members of the IBM Deep Blue team, believes that Hans Berliner covered a lot of ground and achieved excellence in all areas he studied.
The Fredkin Prize in Artificial Intelligence was awarded to IBM's Deep Blue, a machine designed by three CMU alumni that defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov.
Hans Berliner believes that computer chess was a research dead-end as far as artificial intelligence was concerned. He thinks that more powerful processors and machine-learning techniques powered by statistical analysis were able to crack data-intensive problems.
Chinook is a computer checkers program that seems unbeatable and was designed by a team led by Schaeffer. It allows for controlled domain where issues in intelligence can be experimented with.
The text suggests that researchers start with something simple and progress beyond it to tackle harder problems once they have gained a good understanding.
Schaeffer, as per the text, led the team that designed Chinook, a computer checkers program that seems unbeatable and leads the university's computer poker research.
According to Schaeffer, chess allows for a controlled domain where issues in intelligence can be experimented with and progress beyond it to tackle harder problems once they have gained a good understanding.
Hans Berliner is a computer scientist who made significant contributions to the field of artificial intelligence through his work on computer chess.
Berliner achieved excellence in all areas he covered, but it didn't lead to a huge breakthrough that allowed us to better understand human language or translation, or led to a general model of human intelligence.
Computer chess brought about a change in attitude on how we approached a large number of problems in computer science, and it led to lasting value in the field.
Berliner produced something that had lasting value and his papers contain insights, algorithms, and new ideas that aren't as common today as they should be.
Berliner's papers are still around because he never took the easy way and most scientists aren't willing to take such risks.
Emile Berliner invented the gramophone, which was a precursor to all recorded sound formats including hard drives and BluRay discs.
Thomas Edison is generally credited with the invention of recording sound, although Berliner perfected the recorded disc format which was superior to Edison's cylindrical records.
Edison's cylindrical records were difficult to manufacture and store, whereas Berliner's recorded disc format was superior in every way.
Berliner's DNA may be unique because his great-uncle Emile Berliner invented the gramophone, which took risks and led to innovative formats.
Emile Berliner invented the gramophone, also known as the phonograph.
Emile Berliner's recorded discs were superior in every way and arguably the predecessor of all formats that followed, including hard drives and BluRay discs.
Hans Berliner entered public school in Germany just as Adolf Hitler was rising to power. The first hour of each day consisted of 'religion' (meaning Christianity) and 'National Socialism', which he couldn't participate in.
Germany was a wonderful place for a child interested in science because of its inventiveness and production of high-quality goods.
Hans Berliner had a metal wind-up car that sensed when it was about to run off a ledge and automatically steered away.
While American kindergarteners were finger-painting, German kindergarteners were likely three years ahead in mathematics.
His formative years had a very positive effect on him.
He couldn't join because he was told that he was Jewish and they didn't want him.
Uncle Emile's nephew, Joseph Sanders arranged for about 10 members of their extended family to emigrate to America.
Berliner arrived in the Washington, D.C., area speaking very little English with a thick German accent.
He graduated high school with top grammar marks in his class, and years later, one of his fellow students remembered him as an 'extremely brilliant boy'.
He learned how to play chess from a teen-age friend on a rainy day at the camp.
Berliner enjoyed playing chess as it was a wonderful way for him to discipline his mind and improve his prospects in life.
He achieved master status, winning both the District of Columbia Championship and the Southern States Championship.
Chess helped Berliner to discipline his mind and think ahead. It forced him to deal with a certain level of reality, which he believed improved his prospects in life.
The atmosphere in Hitler's Germany promised nothing but despair. Berliner's parents knew it and decided to leave with their family for America.

taught by rote memorization, and as his grades plummeted, the draft beckoned.
with the German occupation forces
he kept eight games going simultaneously against one of the top German teams--and won them all.
Berliner initially planned not to return to college after his military service.
Isador Turover, a fellow European immigrant who knew Berliner through chess circles, persuaded him to finish his degree by offering him a job in his company.
Berliner changed his field of study from physics to psychology after being hired by Turover.
Berliner was informed that his skills were needed at the Naval Research Lab, leading him to work on problems in 'human engineering' or 'engineering psychology', which is now known as interface design.
Berliner won the 10th Chess Olympiad, the 1953 New York State Championship, and the 1956 Eastern States Open. He also played games blindfolded.
Berliner won his first correspondence chess championship with a margin of victory three times better than any other winner, winning 12 games out of 16 and drawing four.
Berliner remained the top-ranked U.S. correspondence chess player until 2005, even after he stopped competing.
Berliner experienced migraine headaches due to his blindfolded chess games.
Berliner's reputation grew especially strong in correspondence chess--games played through the mail--
From 1965 to 1968, Berliner was theWorld Correspondence Chess Champion.
Berliner won 12 of 16 and drew four times
He remained the top-rankedU.S. correspondence chess player until 2005, long after he stopped competing.
Nearing 40and feeling frustrated, Berliner in 1967 met future Nobel laureate and TuringAward winner Herb Simon at a technical meeting.
In 1956, Simon, associate dean of what was then known asCMU's Graduate School of Industrial Administration, had predicted (to his laterchagrin) that within 10 years a computer would become world chess champion.
Twoyears later, with Allen Newell and Cliff Shaw, Simon wrote one of the firstchess-playing programs, known as NSS.
Berliner remembers being unimpressed withNSS, which took up to an hour to make a move: 'They could play against somehuman who played even worse, but it couldn't come close to beating a rankedplayer.'
More than a decade later, Simon remained interested inchess computers.
Simon offered Berliner a job.
Berliner turned down the job initially because he wanted to be put on the student track.
Berliner joined CMU's Computer Science Department in 1969.
The founding head, Alan Perlis, was an amazing and wonderful person who had a desire for progress and truth.
All new graduate students were expected to pass a rigorous 24-hour take-home exam, the Extended Duration Qualifier.
Berliner started working on computer chess for his thesis because he was interested in it and Newell allowed him to do so.
Alan Turing proposed this idea as far back as the 1940s.
No, Alan Turing lacked a computer capable of executing his rudimentary chess program in 1950.
Alan Turing proposed this idea in the 1940s.
Logic Theorist was a program designed by Newell, Simon and Shaw in the 1950s. They used this program to prove mathematical theorems from Principia Mathematica.
Traversal refers to the process of going through each branch of a tree or graph, checking if it leads to a solution. This was used in Logic Theorist.
Researchers like Claude Shannon believed that brute-force methods, which involve calculating all known positions to solve a problem, would never work.
Chess is useful because it's bounded by rules and takes intelligence to play. It also allows progress without having to 'boil the ocean', meaning that one can focus on a specific subset of problems.
The fact that Logic Theorist generated proofs for a significant number of Principia Mathematica's theorems was considered a major achievement and widely recognized as the world's first 'artificial intelligence' program.
Logic Theorist generated a simpler proof for one of Principia Mathematica's theorems than the commonly accepted proof.
Pruning refers to the process of removing branches from a tree or graph that are not useful for solving a problem. In Logic Theorist, pruning was used to eliminate untrue hypotheses.
Brute-force methods involve calculating all known positions or possibilities to solve a problem. Researchers like Claude Shannon believed that such methods would never work due to their computational complexity.
Chess is particularly useful for AI research because it's bounded by rules, unlike more abstract problems in speech or vision.
Ebeling says that many problems in AI research rely on measurements, statistics and analysis, and results are hard to tease out.
Schaeffer adds that if a researcher is trying to build an 'intelligent' machine, and it can't even play a simple game such as chess, then clearly you have a long way to go.
During Schaeffer's studies in the 1970s, there was only one person in the entire community who was publishing about chess in high-quality scientific venues, and that was Hans Berliner.
Schaeffer says that what makes chess unique among more abstract problems is its bounded rules. It's a very challenging game, yet it's limited in nice ways.
Berliner says that with chess, you don't have to 'boil the ocean' to make progress. You can focus on an interesting subset and make some progress.
Ebeling says that it's not hard to figure out if something is working or not when playing chess. If your program doesn't win, there may be a lot of reasons why it lost, but it's hard to make excuses.
Schaeffer believes that if a researcher is trying to build an 'intelligent' machine, and it can't even play a simple game such as chess, then clearly you have a long way to go.
Berliner's students were focused on developing AI programs that could play complex games like chess, which he believed would be a good test for any intelligent machine.
Berliner's first computer program was 'J.Biit', which he wrote at IBM on his own time.
J. Biit lost to Northwestern University's Chess 3.0 in the first North American Computer Chess Championship.
Berliner's next program, called 'CAPS', remembered previous errors and learned to avoid them before beginning a new search.
Berliner believed that rule-based chess programs were not enough because they left no room for intuition or guesswork, which are important factors in human decision making.
Newell and Simon encouraged Berliner to push onward with his research by telling him that he wasn't trying hard enough and needed to make up more rules.
Berliner learned the game of backgammon from his father-in-law, which he decided to write a program for.
The initial backgammon program by Berliner would get stuck at certain points and bog down because it kept trying to optimize things that it should have forgotten about.
Berliner realized that his initial backgammon program had a problem where it would continue to optimize things even after winning, which should have triggered a change of strategy.
Berliner used fuzzy logic, a concept that was still new in the 1970s, to assign different rules 'weights' or 'application factors,' based on their relative importance at each stage of the game.
Berliner found himself pigeonholed because one of his papers on BKG was returned by an AI conference with a note from a reviewer asking why he wasn't working on chess.
Berliner tackled chess with scientific rigor because he was a scientist first and foremost, and he wanted to publish his findings in top journals and conferences.
Campbell wanted to study at CMU because of Berliner's research on chess, which he found fascinating after reading his papers.
BKG became the first computer program to beat a reigning world champion in any game when it defeated backgammon player Luigi Villa in July 1979.
Much of the work in computer chess was ad hoc because it was done by hobbyists for fun and never got published properly.
Berliner's work on chess had a scientific approach because he was a scientist who wanted to publish his findings in top journals and conferences.
In the 1970s, Berliner used fuzzy logic to assign different rules 'weights' or 'application factors,' based on their relative importance at each stage of the game.
Berliner's approach to chess was unique because he tackled it with scientific rigor, publishing his findings in top journals and conferences rather than weak mediocre conferences.
Berliner was pigeonholed because one of his papers on BKG, a program he developed to improve backgammon games, was returned by an AI conference with a note from a reviewer asking why he wasn't working on chess.
Andy Palay is a person who worked on extending the B* algorithm using a probability distribution rather than upper and lower values. He also suggested applying B* to chess.
Andy Palay used the power of computers to search in a way that was like a rational human being would search. He extended the B* algorithm using a probability distribution rather than upper and lower values.
B* is an algorithm used for searching, unlike simple A* 'best-first' searches, it is more directed towards what appear to be the most promising paths. It was extended by Andy Palay using a probability distribution rather than upper and lower values.
Palay suggested applying B* to chess because there are between 30 and 60 legal moves at any given point in a chess game, and searching for those legal moves consumed up to 75 percent of a chess computer's time. He found B* more interesting than brute-force searching.
The problem with using brute-force searching in chess is that it consumed up to 75 percent of a chess computer's time. It also requires more time than other methods.
Carl Ebeling was Palay's friend who was looking for a thesis project that involved hardware. He custom-designed a processor to generate chess moves and used 64 of these processors--one for each square of the chessboard--operating in parallel.
Carl Ebeling custom-designed a processor to generate chess moves and used 64 of these processors--one for each square of the chessboard--operating in parallel. The resulting machine, named Hitech, was used to solve chess problems.
Hitech is a machine that uses 64 processors--one for each square of the chessboard--operating in parallel. It was custom-designed by Carl Ebeling to generate chess moves.
People inside and outside CMU's CS department took turns at a third-floor lab in Wean Hall, wire-wrapping connections. There was such an enthusiasm for Hitech that I've never seen before.
Hitech's working prototype was completed in 1984.
Hitech could consider 175,000 positions per second.
In October 1985, Hitech won Pittsburgh's Gateway Open chess competition and earned the rank of 'master.'
Thompson's paper proved that chess machines improve in direct correlation with the amount of processing power they have.
After Thompson's paper, many researchers shifted their focus from creating smarter searches to faster computers because chess machines improve in direct correlation with the amount of processing power they have.
Campbell was also collaborating with fellow grad students Feng-hsiung Hsu and Thomas Anantharaman on another chess-playing computer known as ChipTest.
By 1987, ChipTest was searching 500,000 moves per second.
In 1987, ChipTest won the North American Computer Chess Championship.
ChipTest was a chess-playing computer developed by fellow grad students Feng-hsiung Hsu (CS'90) and Thomas Anantharaman (CS'86,'90).
The machine that beat Kasparov in 1997 was called Deep Blue.
IBM hired them because they led development on the machine that became Deep Blue which beat Kasparov in 1997.
The chess-playing computer developed by Campbell and his team was called Hitech.
In 1987, ChipTest could search 500,000 moves per second.
The chess-playing computer developed by Hsu and Anantharaman was called ChipTest.

The student may be put on academic probation or dismissed from the program, depending on their standing and previous infractions.
To monitor individual student progress towards graduation regarding the fulfillment of curricular requirements, course grades, and academic integrity.
Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide such a letter.
Through The HUB website: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/verifications/
The student may be dismissed from the program.
They must enroll in courses as advised by their academic advisor and maintain a cumulative QPA of 3.0.
The AIV will be noted in their letter of review and may result in further academic actions.
The student will be placed on academic probation for the following semester and required to enroll in courses as advised by the academic advisor, improve his/her grades to no less than an overall 3.0 QPA in the following semester, and meet any other goal set by the advisor during that period (e.g., fulfilling a core course requirement).
The student will be considered at risk of being unable to complete the program and will be considered for dismissal. He/she will be required to meet with the program director to discuss his/her situation.
If a student's cumulative QPA remains below 3.0 in the following semester, they will be considered for dismissal from the program.
Students must maintain a cumulative QPA of 3.0 to remain in good standing with the program.
The MCDS program committee ascertains that the student is likely to complete the program.
During this time, students are required to enroll in courses as advised by their academic advisors and improve their grades to no less than a 3.0 QPA.
Their role includes advising students on which courses they should enroll in and setting goals for them to achieve, such as fulfilling a core course requirement.
If a student fails to improve his/her grades or meet any other goal set by the advisor, they will be considered for dismissal from the program.
An infraction
The student will be dismissed from the program.
They are encouraged to meet with their academic advisor to discuss a plan to mitigate the situation.
An instructor may award a grade of 'I' when a student has been unable to complete the work of a course, but only if the work completed up to that date is of passing quality.
The instructor must specify the requirements for completing the work and designate a default letter grade in case the student fails to complete the remaining work.
The grounds for dismissal include committing two Academic Integrity Violations deemed infractions by the MCDS committee, committing an Academic Integrity Violation where the violation is deemed sufficiently egregious as determined by the MCDS program committee, and infringing a University Policy.
They are encouraged to communicate early and often with their academic advisor for the best chances of success.
It is expected that students will complete a course during the academic semester in which the course was taken, as incomplete grades provide no undue advantage over other students.
The work completed up to that date must be of passing quality for the student to receive an incomplete grade.
An 'I' grade stands for Incomplete, which means that a student has not completed all the required course work.
If a student fails to complete the required course work by the end of an academic semester, they must finish it sooner as per the instructor's requirement.
The default letter grade designated by the instructor in case of incomplete course work is specified when awarding an 'I' grade.
Students are given until the end of the following academic semester or sooner if instructed by the teacher to complete their remaining work.
The number 20 likely represents the total amount of course work that a student needs to complete before receiving an 'I' grade, or it could be used for other purposes as per the instructor's discretion.
The term means that when an 'I' grade is awarded, the teacher specifies what letter grade will be given if the student fails to complete their remaining work.
Course work is considered completed when all assigned tasks and assignments have been finished by the student according to the instructor's requirements.
An 'I' grade may negatively impact a student's GPA and could potentially limit their access to certain programs, scholarships, or job opportunities.
The instructor plays a crucial role by specifying the requirements for completing course work and designating a default letter grade if the student fails to complete their remaining tasks.
The Registrar will automatically assign a default grade.
The default grade becomes the grade of record.
They should discuss the matter with the course instructor and provide evidence that the grade issued was incorrect.
The student should contact the program administrator to process a Change of Grade Form.
The instructor is generally considered as the final authority for a course grade.
If the requirements for the MCDS degree have not been completed when a student leaves, the degree will not be awarded.

Before founding Lycos, Michael Loren 'Fuzzy' Mauldin was a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University.
After co-founding Conversive, Michael Loren 'Fuzzy' Mauldin went on to retire in Austin, Texas, where he currently raises cattle with his wife and continues to compete in robot battles.
Before creating the Lycos search engine, Michael Loren 'Fuzzy' Mauldin worked as a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University.
To commercialize his product, Michael Loren 'Fuzzy' Mauldin aligned his ducks by having lawyers, accountants, and licensing agreements on hand before trying to commercialize his product.
The intellectual property entitlement split for Carnegie Mellon University is currently 50-50, meaning the inventor owns half and the school gets the other half.
Michael Loren 'Fuzzy' Mauldin competed in televised BattleBots competitions in 2000.
Michael Loren 'Fuzzy' Mauldin created the Lycos search engine from three pages of code while working as a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon in 1994.
Michael Loren 'Fuzzy' Mauldin sold his Lycos search engine to someone else after creating it from three pages of code while working as a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon in 1994.
Michael Loren 'Fuzzy' Mauldin meant that he had lawyers, accountants, and licensing agreements on hand before trying to commercialize his product.
Advantages include credibility and liquidity. Disadvantages include constant worrying about stock prices and quarterly performance.
The IPO pricing process involves determining an ideal share price range, usually between $10 to $100. In Lycos' case, it needed a minimum of $10 and a maximum of $100.
After the first day of trading, Lycos' share prices shot up to $29.
Mauldin was most proud that Lycos helped make search free for the world and showed there's money in search.
Mauldin covered topics such as debt and equity, accretion and dilution, and how a transaction affects a company's earnings per share.
Lycos went public in less than nine months after Mauldin started the process.
Mauldin claimed that Lycos had the fastest IPO ever, taking only a little over nine months from start to finish.
Mauldin sold Lycos because he predicted the internet bubble and wanted to cash in before other companies went public.
Mauldin stated that as a public company, there is constant worrying about stock prices and what will happen at the end of each quarter instead of focusing on long-term goals.
Mauldin played a significant role in Lycos, helping to guide it through its initial public offering and explaining business principles to students and faculty.
Mauldin claimed that he sold Lycos and started the frenzy of internet company IPOs in the late ‘90s.
Mauldin is proudest because his company allowed people access to information found on the other side of the world and showed that there was money in search.
Mauldin advised future entrepreneurs not only to invent something but also to get paid for taking investments, grow them as large as possible and secure both company and stockholder satisfaction.
Mauldin’s advice about startups and the IPO process is still very relevant today.
Facebook, Groupon, numerous companies worth over $100 million two years after startup and many others have succeeded by following Mauldin’s advice.
The ones that die are those that don’t adapt, as per Michael Shamos' comment.

The purpose of the MCDS program setting tuition each year for all students in the program is to determine how much money needs to be collected from each student.
A sponsored student who has any tuition problems should contact The Hub for assistance, as the MCDS Program Administrators cannot solve these issues.
A sponsored student needs to provide information about the other party (such as an embassy or company) that has agreed to pay their tuition, typically in the form of a letter of support.
Students with an employer reimbursement plan should write their employer's name and address on the bill, pay at least one-third of the tuition amount upfront, and provide CMU with a letter of support.
The purpose of writing an employer's name and address on the bill for students with an employer reimbursement plan is to confirm that the employer has agreed to pay a portion or all of the student's tuition.
If a sponsored student does not have any tuition problems, they do not need to contact The Hub or take any further action.
The role of MCDS Program Administrators is to provide information and guidance, but they cannot solve tuition problems. Students need to contact The Hub for assistance with these issues.
If an employer does not reimburse a student for the full amount of their tuition, they may need to seek financial assistance or make alternative arrangements to pay the remaining balance.
The purpose of providing CMU with a letter of support from an employer for students with an employer reimbursement plan is to confirm that the employer has agreed to pay a portion or all of the student's tuition.

Price/performance comparison of C.mmp and the PDP-10
The main topic of discussion in the text is a comparison between C.mmp and PDP-10, focusing on their cost/performance advantage.
The analysis shows that a multiprocessor system like C.mmp has a cost/performance advantage of three to four times over uniprocessor systems such as the PDP-10 when similar technologies are used.
The authors address this question by discussing their design and performance analysis of partial-multiple-bus interconnection networks. This evolution from multiple-bus structures aims to improve cost-effectiveness.

In 2014, the School of Computer Science celebrated its 25th year as a stand-alone college within Carnegie Mellon University.
Herb Simon (H’90), associate dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration—now known as CMU’s Tepper School of Business—established Carnegie Tech’s first Computation Center with the help of its first director, Alan Perlis (S’42).
In 1956 and 1957, Simon, Allen Newell (IA’57) and Cliff Shaw of RAND designed the Logic Theorist, a computer program that could develop proofs for theorems in much the same way a human would work.
Perlis, Simon and Newell are credited with defining the term “computer science” as “the theory and design of computers,” as well as (in Newell’s words) “the study of the phenomena arising from them.”
In 1958, Perlis began teaching the first freshman-level computer programming course in the United States at Carnegie Tech.
The IBM 650 had magnetic-drum memory and a processing speed of approximately 60 instructions per second.

Some of the large projects that emerged in the Computer Science Department at CMU included C.mmp, a shared-memory multiprocessor computer with 16 processing units, and Cm*, a 50-processor computer.
The Xerox Alto was considered a forerunner to many computing environments that followed. It featured a graphical user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse.
Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU’s own 'three-M' machine—a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.
An executive at Pittsburgh’s Westinghouse Electric Corp., Tom Murrin, collaborated with Jordan and Reddy to create the Robotics Institute.
The A.M. Turing Award is considered the Nobel Prize of computing. As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings.
Reddy served as the first director of the Robotics Institute, which was established in 1979.
By 1982, the Computer Science Department included more than 30 faculty members and 100 graduate students.
CSD emerged as a highly agile, interdisciplinary entity with many new faculty members taking joint appointments with other CMU departments.
Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision-making theory. As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction and began a long relationship with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center.

Edmund Melson Clarke was born on July 27, 1945.
He received a BA from the University of Virginia in 1967.
Edmund Melson Clarke studied under Robert Constable at Cornell University.
Clarke currently works at Carnegie Mellon University, where he is the FORE Systems University Professor of Computer Science and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
Clarke’s career has focused on mathematical reasoning about computer systems, with an emphasis on reasoning about the reliability of those systems.
It is necessary but very hard because a computer system executes simple operations that can occur in a staggering number of different orders. This makes it impossible for the designer to envision every possible sequence and predict its consequences.
The worst consequence if a program executes an incorrect sequence is that it could cause injury or loss of life.
Every one of those sequences, no matter how infrequently executed, must be correct because if a program executes an incorrect sequence at the very least it will waste a user’s time.
He received an MA from Duke University in 1968.
Describing sequences of operations in computer systems can be difficult due to multiple programs running simultaneously and the many possible execution orderings.
Tony Hoare was one of the first researchers who developed logical forms better-suited to describing computer systems, including Hoare’s logic that could prove every possible execution would only execute an acceptable sequence of operations.
Clarke's early research strengthened the foundations of Hoare’s logic and extended his method, making it applicable to smaller systems.
Hoare's method for verifying system performance worked well for smaller systems but became close to impossible to apply to larger, more complex ones due to the sheer number of possible execution orderings.
In 1977, Amir Pnueli introduced temporal logic, an alternative logic for verifying computer systems that allows explicit reasoning about time.
Temporal logic allowed researchers to express statements such as 'This condition will remain true until a second condition becomes true', making it possible to verify that systems perform according to specification every time, no matter the circumstances.
The dream of early researchers was to develop powerful and effective methods for reasoning about all possible orderings of a system, which remained unfulfilled despite advancements like Hoare's logic and temporal logic.
The term 'multiple programs running simultaneously' refers to a feature of modern computer hardware where multiple software applications or processes can run at the same time, which presents challenges for system verification.
Formal logic is a branch of mathematics that studies logical reasoning and its expression in systems. It was initially thought to be sufficient to describe every possible sequence and ensure correctness, even for simultaneously-running programs.
Amir Pnueli
Temporal logic can be directly checked by machine, whereas Hoare’s logic requires the designer to consider every detail of both the system and the argument about the system’s correctness.
They realized that a program could exhaustively construct every possible sequence of actions a system might perform, and for every action it could evaluate a property expressed in temporal logic. If the program found the property to be true for every possible action in every possible sequence, this proved the property for the system.
Jean-Pierre Queille and Joseph Sifakis
When it detects a problem in a system design, the checker prints out an example sequence of actions that gives rise to the problem. Initial designs always get some details wrong.
The error traces provided by model checking are invaluable for designers, because they precisely locate the source of the problems.
Pnueli’s logic could be implemented in a computer program. The responsibilities could be divided: the designer focused on specifying the system, while the software ensured that the proposed system would always perform correctly.
Temporal logic allows explicit reasoning about time. It is possible to express statements such as, 'This condition will remain true until a second condition becomes true' in it.
One of the great strengths of the model checking approach is that when it detects a problem in a system design, the checker prints out an example sequence of actions that gives rise to the problem.
Early model checkers required explicitly computing every possible configuration of values a program might assume, which led to an explosive growth in the number of states. This rapid growth is called the state space explosion.
The 1981 paper [2] demonstrated that model checking was possible in principle, but its application to practical systems was severely limited due to the number of states to search.
One limitation of early model checkers was their ability to handle large amounts of data. The number of possible states grows at an explosive speed, which made it difficult for them to verify that a required property was true for every state.
The state space explosion refers to the rapid growth in the number of possible states as more data is manipulated. This makes it difficult for model checkers to verify that a required property is true for every state.
The error traces provided by model checking are invaluable for designers because they precisely locate the source of problems. This helps them understand where their designs went wrong and how to fix these issues.
One example given in the text that requires 7 storage locations is a program that counts the millimeters of rain at a weather station each day of the week. Each location needs to be big enough to hold the largest rain level expected in a single day.
This simple program has 10^21 possible states, which is slightly less than the number of stars in the observable universe. This is due to the fact that it needs to store each day's rain level for every day of the week.
In this context, 'practical systems' refers to computer programs or designs that are large enough to handle significant amounts of data and complex operations. These systems require more advanced model checking techniques than those used for small systems.
The rapid growth in the number of possible states as systems become more complex.
Because it could only handle small systems due to the state space explosion.
They observed that a single memory location can represent many potential states, but only one at a time.
It dramatically reduced storage required to represent state spaces by tersely encoding multiple states while permitting efficient computation of formulas in temporal logic.
They demonstrated flaws in the design of an IEEE standard for interconnecting computer components by exhaustively checking every possible case.
It allowed for the discovery and consideration of potential errors in rare cases that had been previously overlooked.
A type of system that uses an encoding to represent many potential states with a single value, allowing for efficient computation and reduced storage requirements.
It allowed for the representation of much larger systems without an exponential increase in memory usage or computational time, making it feasible for practical-sized systems.
State space explosion refers to the rapid growth of possible states as a system becomes more complex. This makes it difficult for early model checkers, which were designed for small systems, to handle larger ones efficiently.
Model checking is used to verify designs for integrated circuits, computer networks, and software.
The use of model checkers has substantially improved the reliability and safety of the systems upon which modern life depends.
Model checkers have been used to analyze systems whose state space (10 120) is substantially larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe.
It is becoming particularly important in the verification of software designed for recent generations of integrated circuits, which feature multiple processors running simultaneously.

Their concern was not having an undergraduate program, as they had a surplus of graduate students.
They felt that CSD’s needs were not adequately represented in MCS.
Creating another department about to become a college made them angry.
University politics are like sibling rivalry on steroids.
Allen Newell deserves most of the credit.
Simon was already connected to the rest of the school and didn't care whether computer science was a department or a school.
Allen had a careful, logical-thinking and great statesman like Benjamin Franklin.
Ninety percent of the maneuvering was done by Allen Newell.
Allen Newell
He became an administrator to get separated from his research obligations.
Angel Jordan
He put across the spin-out over the objections of many people.
Pat Crecine
He created the College of Computing, which was more or less a replica of what they were doing at Carnegie-Mellon.
He said that it's always secondary to the science and if you go after institutions, you don’t get any science done.
Nico
They were energized, no matter how discouraged they got.
Pat Crecine
The College of Computing, which was more or less a replica of what they were doing at Carnegie-Mellon.
In mid-1980s
The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.
Pat Crecine
The remaining researchers who developed Andrew.
Because they had similar names
Newell
The School of Computer Science.
There was confusion because both School of Computer Science and Computer Science Department existed.
Pat Crecine suggested this name.
Newell suggested that it should be called 'School of Computer Science.'
In the fall of 1988, they agreed.
Habermann was appointed as CMU’s first Dean of Computer Science.
SCS made its formal debut on Dec. 22, 1988.
The official announcement was made Jan. 3, 1989.
Scott thought an undergraduate program should have been introduced much earlier.
The level of university support and whether the field was mature enough for an undergraduate program.
Shaw
The Carnegie Plan says, in substance, that an undergraduate education should include durable education in the ideas of the field. It should teach critical thinking … Yes, it should teach you some of the current skills, but to justify its place in the curriculum, any course needs to have durable intellectual content that will outlast a couple of changes in technology.

TRAUB compares CMU to China, stating that it's like visiting a new country every time he returns due to the constant reinvention and growth.
SIEWIOREK suggests that there are fewer big, cohesive projects like 'Andrew' or 'Wireless Andrew', which he believes could service the entire campus.
REDDY thinks that CMU should focus on unique and innovative areas such as software, algorithms, robotics, learning, and language.
The Gates-Hillman complex impressed TRAUB during his last visit to CMU.
If SCS had not succeeded in the 1970s, it would have gone sub-critical and CMU might not be a powerhouse in computer science.
In this context, 'sub-critical' refers to the state of an organization or system that is no longer thriving and may be at risk of failure.
Red Whittaker, E’75,’79, works on big projects such as those involving robotics.
The 'Andrew' and 'Wireless Andrew' visions represent significant projects that have shaped CMU's history and growth.
Model checking has attracted a lot of interest from the academic community at CMU.
The main topic discussed in this text is the potential of computer science to transform the world 10 or 20 years from now.
Shaw mentions two main challenges: doing more research that directly connects with how people use their computers and helping individuals control their own computing. He also highlights electronic medical records as a big opportunity, but notes an impediment is data interchange.
Scott identifies two key areas: managing and securing distributed computing facilities (like the cloud) and integrating computer resources into teaching. He believes these issues have not been fully resolved.
The term 'HCII' refers to the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where researchers are working on usable security.
Shaw believes that many individuals struggle with managing their own personal computers and preventing infections, despite the prevalence of these issues.
Shaw mentions electronic medical records as a significant area where computer science could make an impact. However, he notes that data interchange remains a challenge.
Scott sees the potential for distributed facilities in computing like the cloud as a significant opportunity, but also acknowledges challenges such as ensuring security and operational efficiency.
Scott believes that producing well-designed courses with remote interaction on computers and integrating these into academic degrees needs further development.
Reddy speculates about a 10 or 20-year timeline for potential transformations in the field of computer science.
The main topic of the text is the democratization of computing and how it affects computer science.
Reddy said 'In the old days, a few people used to know a lot of things'.
The Simon Initiative is an opportunity for deeper science and higher-level vision in computer science.
The text is attributed to SIEWIOREK.
According to Reddy, democratization of computing means that everyone can have access to advanced computing at a fraction of the cost.
Jason Togyer is someone who provides more information about computer science. One can contact him by calling 412-268-8721 or emailing jt3y@cs.cmu.edu.
The two aspects of The Simon Initiative, as per Reddy, are deeper science underneath and a higher-level vision.
It's an opportunity because democratization of computing means that everyone can have access to advanced computing at a fraction of the cost, which could potentially lead to more innovation and advancement in the field.
The phrase 'way out in front' indicates that The Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center was leading in its field, but then shallow investigations came along.

Two successful Teaching Assistantships (TA-ships) are required, typically one for an undergraduate class and one for a graduate-level class. One of these may be in some form of pre-approved 'alternate service', such as an SCS ‘v-unit’.
Graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct, as mandated by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. The full university policy can be reviewed at: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-instructors.html
Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center rates the fluency of all instructional personnel to determine at what level of responsibility they can serve as TA. They also administer the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test, a mandatory screening test for non-native speakers.
Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center helps these TAs develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully. More information can be found on their website: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/
The process of completing a Ph.D. dissertation has three important milestones: proposal, research and writing, and final submission.
The Ph.D. dissertation is the defining feature of a Ph.D. degree.
Two (2) successful Teaching Assistantships (TA-ships), as determined by the faculty member for whom the student serves as TA.
The ITA test is a mandatory screening test for any non-native speaker of English to evaluate their fluency before they can serve as teaching assistants.
The TA-ship may not be accepted.
The Ph.D. dissertation
During the third year of their Ph.D.
The student will specify the problem they are addressing (the thesis topic), its significance, competing approaches, preliminary results, remaining work to be done, evaluation metrics for that work.
A thesis statement describes the claimed solution to the research problem that is the thesis topic when the dissertation is finished.
Near the end of the third year
The student will specify other relevant research, including competing approaches.
The thesis topic typically develops from the directed research that the student has been carrying out with their advisor, and it should be interesting and unsolved.
Evaluation metrics are used to assess the work that still must be completed.
The thesis topic typically develops from the directed research that the student has been carrying out with their advisor.
The projected timeline for completion of a PhD in SCS involves securing approval for a dissertation committee, presenting the proposal to the scientific community, and submitting the thesis document at the end of the fifth year. The student must also publicly announce the time and place of their thesis defense one week before it occurs.
A public thesis proposal protects the student by ensuring that their proposed research is interesting to the larger scientific community and demonstrates that they will finish the program if the work is completed as outlined.
The dissertation document should include a detailed description of all the work done, including a clear evaluation and discussion of its scientific contributions. The only format requirement is that the title page should be suitable to be issued as an LTI Technical Report.
University rules require that the time and place of the dissertation defense be publicly announced at least one week before it occurs. This should also be coordinated with Ph.D. Program Coordinator.
At the time of public announcement, a draft of the thesis document must be made available online.
SCS ensures that students meet their research speaking requirement by requiring them to present their work in a public forum, such as at conferences or seminars.
The Ph.D. Program Coordinator plays an important role in ensuring that students meet all requirements for their degree, including coordinating public announcements and ensuring timely completion of thesis defense.
Securing approval from at least two other SCS faculty members working in language technologies ensures that the student's research aligns with their area of expertise and receives valuable feedback.
The external member provides an outside perspective on the student's work, ensuring that it meets high standards of scientific rigor and contributes to the broader field.
At the time of the public announcement, a draft of the thesis document must be made available online.
All LTI Ph.D. students are required to complete an annual oral presentation at the LTI to emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills and increase internal awareness of LTI work.
At least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor. The public may also be invited.
The advisor's role is to guide the education and monitor the progress of the student through the program, as well as supervise the student's directed research.
An LTI Ph.D. student must complete one annual oral presentation by the end of May.
The purpose of providing written feedback after a student's oral presentation is to help refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery.
The thesis proposal and defense each count towards this requirement.
At least two LTI faculty members, including the research advisor, will convene to provide written feedback.
The Program Director of graduate programs receives a copy of the written feedback provided after a student's oral presentation.
Students are expected to select their advisors during the first month of the program.
Until a student finds a specific advisor, the Program Director of the LTI graduate programs serves as their advisor.
Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation lectures, where faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise. They should also be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors.
Students indicate a first, second, and third choice for advisor after meeting with several potential advisors. The potential advisors determine how many new students they can take and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a 'Matching Committee' to determine the best set of matches.
Yes, it is possible for students to change advisors. They should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors.
During these lectures, faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise. Students are expected to attend these lectures as part of the matching process.
Choosing an advisor carefully ensures that the student receives necessary faculty mentoring and career advice. It also helps in forming a strong student-advisor relationship, which takes time.
The Program Director of the LTI graduate programs serves as the advisor until a student finds a specific one.
The student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor and then make a request to the Program Director to switch. Both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change.
Students are expected to attend the orientation lectures and treat them as seriously as a standard course because they provide an introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI.
The original name for these talks was 'the Immigration Course (IC)', which aimed to orient newly-arrived students into the CMU environment.
The purpose of End of Semester Evaluation is for faculty members to evaluate each student's academic progress and provide a letter at the end of the semester.
Students are expected to prepare a statement that describes their achievements during the current semester and plans for the next semester.
The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate during the end-of-semester evaluation process.
LTI Orientation provides an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students and helps them learn about the work done by CMU faculty.
The name 'Immigration Course (IC)' was used to signify that these talks help orient newly-arrived students into the CMU environment.
The primary purpose of LTI Orientation is to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students and help them learn about the work done by CMU faculty.
A student's statement should include their achievements during the current semester and plans for the next semester.
A good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing their degree.
Letters indicating trouble from faculty should be considered as serious warnings. They are not permanent 'black marks' on the student's record, but if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in their transcript.
In serious cases, if a faculty gives an 'N-1' letter to a student, it specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all these specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.
Yes, students can take elective courses outside of SCS at Carnegie Mellon or cross-registered at the University of Pittsburgh. However, they must fulfill their program requirements as described above and discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor.
Students interested in taking recommended electives outside the SCS should pay attention to issues like whether these courses count towards 'SCS' course requirements, need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., summer courses), and discuss with their advisor.
Yes, recommended electives outside of the SCS can count towards the 'SCS' course requirement. However, students need approval from their program director for these courses.
Typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses.
Students interested in taking recommended electives outside the SCS should have a discussion with their advisor to ensure they fulfill all requirements and understand any potential issues.
The purpose of an 'N-1' letter is to specify a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all these specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.
If a student fails to meet all the specified conditions in an 'N-1' letter, it may result in their termination from the program.
The purpose of this text is to inform students about issues they should consider when taking recommended electives outside the SCS, such as getting approval for non-covered courses and understanding grading policies.
The consequences of taking an outside course that does not meet the minimum 'B' grade requirement for Ph.D. is unclear from this text.
Students can use courses that satisfy LTI Ph.D. requirements for one M.S. degree, the most common choice being the LTI's Master of Language Technologies (MLT) degree due to similar requirements.
Yes, according to this text, students interested in taking recommended electives outside the SCS should pay particular attention to getting approval for these courses.
The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course, but the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy still applies.
Students should consider getting approval for non-covered courses and understanding grading policies, as mentioned in the text.
The text does not provide clear information about whether a student can use an M.S. degree from another department to satisfy LTI Ph.D. requirements.
According to this text, courses that satisfy LTI Ph.D. degree requirements may also be used to satisfy requirements for one M.S. degree.
The text states that students interested in taking recommended electives outside the SCS should pay particular attention to getting approval from their Program Director.
Students interested in an M.S. degree other than the MLT degree should discuss their plans with their Ph.D. advisor due to the additional courses and project work that may be involved.
Carnegie Mellon’s Grading policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.
The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university policy.
See the university’s Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures web page information. https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of- for more grades-and-academic-actions.html
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-assignment.html
The purpose of the policy is to record grades from Carnegie Mellon courses and those taken through cross-registration programs, while not considering transfer credits without grade in academic actions or QPA calculations.
PCHE stands for Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education.
Courses taken through a cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA.
QPA stands for Quality Point Average.
Transfer courses will be recorded on the transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be considered for academic actions or QPA calculations.
The LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook provides information about policies and procedures for graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University, including those related to transfer courses.
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-assignment.html
The purpose of a cross-registration program is to allow students to take courses at other accredited institutions.
Students can find information about appeal and grievance procedures on the university’s Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures web page.
The purpose of the policy is to define and outline consequences for cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.
If a student commits a second violation while on disciplinary probation, they are dismissed from the graduate program.
The process for investigating and adjudicating violations is outlined in the procedures provided by the LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook.
Dismissal from the graduate program means that a student is no longer allowed to continue their studies in the program and must leave the university.
According to the text, one violation can lead to dismissal if it is not immediately addressed by a disciplinary hearing. If there's no immediate dismissal after the first violation, then two violations while on probation will result in dismissal.
Disciplinary probation is a status given to students who have committed their first academic integrity violation. It means that the student is under close supervision and any further violations could lead to dismissal.
If a student commits a second violation while on disciplinary probation, they are immediately dismissed from the graduate program.
The University Policy on Academic Integrity allows for convening a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.
The purpose of the Appeals of Course Level Action section is to provide more information about the appeal process for violations of academic integrity.
A degree can be withdrawn if it was granted based on falsified work or academic records.
Withdrawal of the degree occurs promptly upon discovery of the falsification.

A student in the program may not take more than sixty (60) units per semester without permission from the program director.
A student in the program must be registered for a minimum thirty-six (36) units per semester to be considered a full-time student.
Yes, all international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status.
No, reduced course load is not permitted for MIIS students.
Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, “permit of stay”).
No, pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement except for the 11-696 (A) Capstone Planning Seminar and 11-935 (R) LTI Practicum.
No, graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.
Yes, an equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the MIIS breadth requirements.
No, satisfying a breadth requirement with a course from another institution does not reduce the number of CMU course units that must be taken to attain the MIIS degree.
The application materials required for transfer into the MIIS program include an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts.
No, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo exams or produce new transcripts from other universities.
The MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving a student's request for transfer. The program will consider whether the coursework done prior to the transfer allows the student to be 'on schedule' by the end of the spring semester, so that they can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall semester.
Yes, MIIS students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS-16 to MIIS-21 and vice versa) after beginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests should be filed within the first semester of the program.
U.S. citizens have no restrictions on how many times they can switch if it is done for a legitimate reason. To confirm the legitimacy of the reason to switch tracks, all students must seek their advisor's approval and the approval of the Director of the MIIS program.
When a student transfers out of the MIIS program, they will be subject to additional financial obligations. It is highly recommended not to switch tracks more than once as multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration records for international students.
Students who wish to transfer out of the MIIS program should follow the standard procedures for leaving CMU and their specific degree program.
Students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS-16 to MIIS-21 and vice versa) after beginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests should be filed within the first semester of the program.
Multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration records for international students. It is highly recommended not to switch tracks more than once.
U.S. citizens have no restrictions on how many times they can switch if it is done for a legitimate reason.
All students must seek their advisor's approval and the approval of the Director of the MIIS program.
Yes, students can transfer to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted.
The student should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.
All units must be recorded on the transcript within seven years of the date on which the student enrolled in the program, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school, or college policy.
Yes, it can be extended by the SCS Associate Dean for Graduate Education for special circumstances that do not make it possible for the student to complete the requirements within the statutory period.
The request must be approved by the Department Head and by the SCS Associate Dean for Graduate Education.
The waiver request must explain the exceptional circumstances that warrant an extension.

The LTI grants transfer credit or issues an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution.
If a student is exempt from a required course, they can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place.
If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, they receive that many units of credit. The total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.
The information about the MIIS Graduate Student Handbook can be found on page 24 of the handbook.
The decision to grant transfer credit or issue an exemption rests with the director of the program.
Yes, if a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, they can replace that course with an open elective and take any course that could normally count towards the degree in its place.
When a student completes graduate courses at another institution, they can receive transfer credit or an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution.
If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. They do not receive any additional credit for the external course.
When a student receives transfer credit, they have completed courses at another institution that can be counted towards their degree requirements at CMU or MIIS. The total amount of required coursework is reduced by the number of units received.
External employment and consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss this with their Advisor.
A student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor.
The LTI may remove the student from the program or strongly encourage the student to consider switching to the four-semester program (MIIS-21) to complete all the requirements.
Students are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is typically allowed in the summer.

The article discusses Rick Rashid's management style and his influence on Microsoft Research.
Rick Rashid was a professor in the computer science department who hated meetings and would often 'manage by wandering the halls'.
Rick Rashid left Carnegie Mellon in 1991 and became senior vice president of research for Microsoft Corp. where he hired Rich Draves.
The text does not provide any information about the current status or whereabouts of Rick Rashid, as it was last updated in 1991.
Microsoft Research is investing heavily into research into computer vision, e-Commerce applications and Web services, including search engine technology.
Some notable figures associated with Microsoft Research include Turing Award winners Tony Hoare and Butler Lampson, as well as Jim Gray until his disappearance.
Microsoft is investing heavily into research into computer vision, e-Commerce applications and Web services, including search engine technology.
The work done at Microsoft Research has led directly to the creation of: Microsoft Virtual Earth and TerraServer; data mining and machine-learning tools on the company's SQL Servers; rendering technology and artificial intelligence inside Xbox.
Jeff Eppinger (CS'88) is one of the founders of Transarc Corp. and currently a professor of the practice in Carnegie Mellon's Institute for Software Research.
Jeff Eppinger says, 'Don't bet against Steve Jobs,' and I'd say, 'Don't bet against Rick Rashid.'
The working atmosphere at Microsoft Research feels very academic, according to Draves.
Rashid models Microsoft Research after Carnegie Mellon's computer science culture because he wants to find researchers who can make an impact in their fields; collaborate with others from different backgrounds; and thrive when given freedom to pursue ideas.
Rashid looks for candidates who have curiosity, are excited about computer science as a discipline, and stake out new territory intellectually.
Having the attitude of 'I'm going to keep moving and stake out new territory intellectually' is important because it ensures a long career in computer science.
Having an attitude of 'I'm going to keep moving and stake out new territory intellectually'
He identifies with the thoughtful management style of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, who delegated authority rather than barking commands.
Rashid is a huge fan of the 'Star Trek' franchise and even has a Starfleet uniform like the one Patrick Stewart wore on the TV series.
Rashid started taking his researchers to the premiere of each new 'Star Trek' movie --- at his own expense.
Rashid seeks out researchers who are invested in the organization, not just their personal goals.
Carnegie Mellon University holds a special place for Rashid because it's where he started his career and also where his son, Daniel, is currently pursuing his doctoral degree.
Rashid believes that it's important to give back to the university and its students and faculty because he owes a lot of his personal success to the time he spent at Carnegie Mellon.
Home originally was
Rick Rashid was born in Fort Madison, Iowa.
The biggest employers in Fort Madish were the Iowa State Penitentiary and the Sheaffer pen company.
Rick Rashid was interested in science. He was president of the science club at Fort Madison High School and once put together an artificial heart for a science fair.
When Rick Rashid was president of the science club at Fort Madison High School, he once locked himself in a laboratory so no one could interfere with an experiment.
Norma Rashid said that her older brother was always fascinated by science and intense in whatever he did. She remembers watching television coverage of America's space race with her brother.
Rick Rashid wrote his own science fiction stories and fell in love with 'Star Trek.'
According to Norma Rashid, if you're going from fantasy to real science, the logical pathway is through computers.
Rick Rashid saw his first computer (a Hewlett-Packard 2116) during his sophomore year at Stanford University.
Dan Ling, a fellow student and later a Microsoft Research employee, encouraged Rick Rashid to take a basic course in Stanford's Algol-W programming language.

Dan Ling, who was later an employee of Microsoft Research, encouraged Rashid to learn Algol-W.
Rashid decided to go to the University of Rochester for his master's and doctorate in computer science instead of pursuing a higher degree in mathematics because he had an opportunity to program a computer, which was a rush experience.
Rashid's mother cried when she learned that he wanted to go to the University of Rochester for a computer science degree, as it seemed like an unusual choice.
At the University of Rochester, Rashid worked on research into personal computing over local-area networks.
Raj Reddy, who was leading the Scientific Personal Integrated Computing Environment project at Carnegie Mellon, invited Rashid to join the faculty.
SPICE aimed to create a 'three-M' workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display, and a processor capable of handling a million instructions per second.
The Accent operating kernel used memory mapping to save processor time by copying only necessary data for specific operations, allowing processors to share information via secured ports.
The Accent operating kernel was tightly woven around the Three Rivers PERQ workstation, limiting its compatibility with other systems like UNIX.

It saved processor time by copying only the data needed for specific operations rather than complete files.
Mach kernel incorporated Accent's ideas but could run UNIX applications.
His persistent optimism, encouragement to students, tireless work ethic
He was more interested in effective solutions rather than elegant ones.
To show that these concepts would work in practice, not just in principle.
So the Mach developers could 'eat their own dog food.'
One of the goals of the Mach project was to show that these concepts would work in practice, not just in principle.
Rashid had a can-do, positive attitude that rubbed off on a lot of people. In a place that was often rather hectic and sometimes negative, he could make you feel like it was all going somewhere.
Mach supported multiple threads, sharing memory but running independently. That made it easy to expand Mach to run on multiple processors or across clusters of machines. Mach's modular design also kept the kernel size small while allowing to be ported to any number of platforms.
Steve Jobs visited Pittsburgh, left impressed, and recruited Rashid's students, including researcher Avie Tevanian (CS'85,'88) to his new company, NeXT, where the Mach kernel became the heart of the NeXTSTEP OS.
While UNIX allowed only a single thread of execution in a process, Mach supported multiple threads, sharing memory but running independently.
Rick's work was really seminal because it successfully demonstrated ideas that became widely discussed among OS developers. And industry took notice --- Apple co-founder Steve Jobs visited Pittsburgh, left impressed, and recruited Rashid's students to his new company.

Microsoft's chief technology officer, Nathan Myhrvold, also came calling --- to recruit Rashid to set up a research unit, much to Rashid's surprise.
Rick had two conditions before leaving Carnegie Mellon. First, the research unit at Microsoft had to advance the state of the art in any area it explored. Second, it had to turn that research into useful products.
Rick set two key conditions before leaving Carnegie Mellon. First, the research unit at Microsoft had to advance the state of the art in any area it explored. Second, it had to turn that research into useful products.
Rashid was assured by Myhrvold that he'd have the freedom to pursue those goals, and so he made the leap.
Although industrial research organizations aren't unusual --- IBM established its first lab in 1945 --- Eppinger says Microsoft stands out as the only software company funding basic scientific inquiry.
Microsoft scientists working under Rashid have an unusual amount of latitude to pursue research not directly tied to products.
Rick says it's about developing ideas, and then getting those ideas to corporations, and the general public.

Microsoft stands out as the only software company funding basic scientific inquiry.
They're working on altering living cells for use in medical therapies, and adapting algorithms used for digital compression and e-mail filters to model the ways that immune systems fight off intruders.
Microsoft Research has an unusually strong record of collaborating with outside scientists, at least among for-profit corporations.
In a lot of companies, when you have a paper that you want to publish, you have to go through the legal process and get various people to sign off on it. We don't have that process here. The onus is on the researcher to do the right thing.
Microsoft Research investigators have published more than 5,100 peer-reviewed papers so far.
More than 10 percent of those accepted annually by SIGGRAPH since 2002.
The great contribution to mankind is when they let you go off and focus on something fundamental.
The great benefit for the company when you create this level of expertise is that the research group becomes a resource for the product centers of the company.
Other teams are pursuing research into fundamental theories of information retrieval, natural language processing, organizational behavior and human-computer interaction.
The two major focuses for Microsoft Research are cloud computing and data-intensive supercomputing.
Rashid believes that the main focus of research at Microsoft Research should remain on people, not just technology.
Data-intensive supercomputing has given us a better understanding of how we have to describe and talk about structuring data so that we do a better job of sharing it and mapping it.
The speaker in this text is Rashid, who has nearly four decades of experience in computer science.
According to the text, 'disembodied computation' refers to a situation where an end user's device delivers a service rather than processing a lot of data locally.
Jason Togyer can be reached at 412-268-8721 or via email at jt3y@cs.cmu.edu.
Rashid believes that it is because they built an organization with values focused on people who have the ability to think and innovate, not just technology.
This means that data-intensive supercomputing has helped us understand better how we need to describe and talk about structuring data so that it can be shared and mapped more effectively.
Rashid thinks that the main focus of Microsoft Research should remain on people, not just technology.
The first artificial intelligence program created by CMU computer scientists was Logic Theorist, which could solve logic puzzles in a way similar to how humans would.
The researchers at CMU faced that their existing machines were too slow to keep pace with the advance of speech and graphics programs, so they had to do something.
The cognitive tutoring programs were able to adapt, presenting harder or easier problems as students learned or stumbled. They could teach subjects such as algebra to hundreds of thousands of students every year.
The innovation in 1976 by CMU researchers was speech recognition, which allowed computers to recognize and interpret human speech.
The team of CMU researchers gang together 16 processors to build a pioneering computer called C.mmp, and then linked 50 processors into Cm*.
The first program written by Herb Simon, Allen Newell, and Cliff Shaw was Logic Theorist, which could solve logic puzzles in the same way a human might.

Red Whittaker (E'75,'79) moved robots off of the assembly lines and into places no human could go. His Robotic Reconnaissance Vehicle spent four years inspecting and cleaning up the contaminated reactor building at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant.
In 1983, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and IBM made significant strides towards making computers more accessible with the development of new user interface technologies.
The Hearsay I system, developed in 1976 by future Turing Award winner and SCS dean Raj Reddy along with his students, established many principles that still underlie speech recognition software.
Scott Fahlman created the emoticon in 1982 as a joke, but it has endured for more than three decades and is still used today.
The Andrew Project launched in 1982 aimed to put a workstation in every home, office, student, faculty member, and employee's hands. It made CMU the most-wired campus in the world.

The main topic of this article is 'Advanced Optimal Transport'.
The authors of this article are Y. Benamou, M. Gozlan and A. Lellouch.
Optimal transport plays a crucial role in machine learning by providing a mathematical framework for comparing two probability distributions, which can be used to solve various problems such as image registration and data analysis.
Optimal transport differs from other distance metrics like Euclidean or Manhattan distances in that it measures the distance between two probability distributions, rather than individual points. This makes it particularly useful for comparing complex data structures.
Optimal transport provides a mathematical framework that can be used in various machine learning applications, such as generative models, image processing, and anomaly detection. It allows for more sophisticated comparisons of data distributions than traditional distance metrics.
Optimal transport can be used to solve problems such as image registration, where two images need to be aligned so that corresponding points match. It can also be applied to tasks like denoising and segmentation.
The authors present a new algorithm for solving optimal transport problems, which they call the 'entropic regularization method'. This approach allows them to handle complex data distributions more effectively than previous methods.
Entropic regularization is a technique used in optimal transport that adds an entropy term to the cost function. This helps stabilize the algorithm and allows it to handle more complex data distributions.
One of the main challenges is dealing with high-dimensional data, as traditional methods can become computationally expensive and difficult to implement. Another challenge is finding a suitable regularization method that allows for more complex comparisons.

An independent study course allows students to cover a particular area of interest when no formal course is available in that subject area. It often offers the opportunity for research directly with a faculty member and are considered electives.
Each independent study course must be advised and approved by at least one faculty member. Agreement to supervise the course is voluntary on the part of the faculty member.
1) The student must request approval from their academic advisor and complete a proposal before the first day of classes in a given semester. 2) Enter into an agreement with the independent study supervisor that includes course expectations, including deliverables. 3) Secure the 'Independent Study Contract Form' from the MCDS administrator. 4) Complete the form, provide a brief description of the work to be done, including deliverables and how they will be graded. 5) Secure signatures of both the student and the supervisor. Return the form to the MCDS administrator in order to obtain approval for the independent study from the Director.
Independent study contracts must be submitted no later than on the last day of the first week of classes in a given semester.
No course may be used to complete two MCDS degree requirements, nor may a course satisfy requirements in two degree programs.
No, no course may be used to complete two MCDS degree requirements, nor may a course satisfy requirements in two degree programs.
Independent study courses offer an opportunity for research directly with a faculty member, which can be beneficial for students pursuing a Ph.D.
Independent study supervisors are faculty members who agree to advise and guide students taking an independent study course.
Students must negotiate the terms and conditions of the independent study with pertinent faculty members who will be supervising the course.
If a student fails to submit an independent study contract by the deadline, they may not be able to take the course that semester.
Independent study contracts must be submitted no later than on the last day of the first week of classes in a given semester.
No, a course may not be used to complete two MCDS degree requirements nor may it satisfy requirements in two degree programs.

All courses offered by the SCS CMU are graded on the 4.3 grading standard http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html.
MCDS students must obtain a B- or better grade in all courses which count towards core requirements and maintain a 3.0 overall average each semester to remain in good standing.
If an MCDS student does not maintain a 3.0 overall average, they will be placed on academic probation and may face other consequences.
The grading standard for courses offered by SCS CMU is 4.3, which can be found at http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html.
No, a course may not be used to complete two MCDS degree requirements nor may it satisfy requirements in two degree programs.
Independent study contracts must be submitted no later than on the last day of the first week of classes in a given semester.
A cumulative QPA of 3.0
No, only courses that receive a letter grade can count towards the MCDS degree.
The student may be put on academic probation or dismissed from the program, depending on their standing and previous infractions.
To monitor individual student progress towards graduation regarding the fulfillment of curricular requirements, course grades, and academic integrity.
Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide such a letter.
Through The HUB website: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/verifications/
The student may be dismissed from the program.
They must enroll in courses as advised by their academic advisor and maintain a cumulative QPA of 3.0.
The AIV will be noted in their letter of review and may result in further academic actions.
The student will be placed on academic probation for the following semester and required to enroll in courses as advised by the academic advisor, improve his/her grades to no less than an overall 3.0 QPA in the following semester, and meet any other goal set by the advisor during that period (e.g., fulfilling a core course requirement).
The student will be considered at risk of being unable to complete the program and will be considered for dismissal. He/she will be required to meet with the program director to discuss his/her situation.
If a student's cumulative QPA remains below 3.0 in the following semester, they will be considered for dismissal from the program.
Students must maintain a cumulative QPA of 3.0 to remain in good standing with the program.
The MCDS program committee ascertains that the student is likely to complete the program.
During this time, students are required to enroll in courses as advised by their academic advisors and improve their grades to no less than a 3.0 QPA.
Their role includes advising students on which courses they should enroll in and setting goals for them to achieve, such as fulfilling a core course requirement.
If a student fails to improve his/her grades or meet any other goal set by the advisor, they will be considered for dismissal from the program.
An infraction
The student will be dismissed from the program.
They are encouraged to meet with their academic advisor to discuss a plan to mitigate the situation.
An instructor may award a grade of 'I' when a student has been unable to complete the work of a course, but only if the work completed up to that date is of passing quality.
The instructor must specify the requirements for completing the work and designate a default letter grade in case the student fails to complete the remaining work.
The grounds for dismissal include committing two Academic Integrity Violations deemed infractions by the MCDS committee, committing an Academic Integrity Violation where the violation is deemed sufficiently egregious as determined by the MCDS program committee, and infringing a University Policy.
They are encouraged to communicate early and often with their academic advisor for the best chances of success.
It is expected that students will complete a course during the academic semester in which the course was taken, as incomplete grades provide no undue advantage over other students.
The work completed up to that date must be of passing quality for the student to receive an incomplete grade.
An 'I' grade stands for Incomplete, which means that a student has not completed all the required course work.
If a student fails to complete the required course work by the end of an academic semester, they must finish it sooner as per the instructor's requirement.
The default letter grade designated by the instructor in case of incomplete course work is specified when awarding an 'I' grade.
Students are given until the end of the following academic semester or sooner if instructed by the teacher to complete their remaining work.
The number 20 likely represents the total amount of course work that a student needs to complete before receiving an 'I' grade, or it could be used for other purposes as per the instructor's discretion.
The term means that when an 'I' grade is awarded, the teacher specifies what letter grade will be given if the student fails to complete their remaining work.
Course work is considered completed when all assigned tasks and assignments have been finished by the student according to the instructor's requirements.
An 'I' grade may negatively impact a student's GPA and could potentially limit their access to certain programs, scholarships, or job opportunities.
The instructor plays a crucial role by specifying the requirements for completing course work and designating a default letter grade if the student fails to complete their remaining tasks.
The Registrar will automatically assign a default grade.
The default grade becomes the grade of record.
They should discuss the matter with the course instructor and provide evidence that the grade issued was incorrect.
The student should contact the program administrator to process a Change of Grade Form.
The instructor is generally considered as the final authority for a course grade.
If the requirements for the MCDS degree have not been completed when a student leaves, the degree will not be awarded.
No, completion of the MCDS degree does not insure admittance to any doctoral degree program.
Students should refer to Carnegie Mellon University's policy on intellectual property: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html
No, there are no required teaching requirements.
No, there are no required language proficiency requirements. However, they can take advantage of support functions provided by the Intercultural Communication Center (ICC) and the Global Communication Center (GCC).
The student should notify the course instructor for the completion of a Missing Grade Form.
Any form of cheating or plagiarism
Because it is a serious violation of student ethics.
You must not use the work of others without proper citation
No, they cannot use resources, including other persons, except as authorized by the course or project for which they are submitting the work.
Failure to abide by these rules can result in your permanent separation from the University without refund of money paid.
No, such conduct is not accepted or commonplace in the university.
The highest standards of academic integrity
If a student commits a second violation, the expected penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.
Students can review the policy at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html
The purpose of the policy is to provide definitions and expectations around academic integrity, including what constitutes cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.
The policy outlines procedures for investigating, reporting, adjudicating, and appealing academic integrity violations. The severity of these consequences can vary depending on the nature of the offense.
The policy recommends that students review the procedure outlining the investigation, reporting, adjudication, and appeal processes for academic integrity violations.
Final grades may only be changed in exceptional circumstances such as manifest error (e.g., clear errors).
The instructor and department, unit or program have the discretion to approve changes to final grades.
The policy outlines an appeal process that includes reviewing, reporting, adjudicating, and appealing academic integrity violations.
Grading is a matter of sound discretion for the instructor. Final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade.

Allen Newell and Herb Simon, who invented the use of linked-list data structures for representing complex information.
The Link magazine serves as a link between the School of Computer Science and more than 10,000 alumni, colleagues, parents, and other friends around the world.
The Link magazine recognizes the pioneering work of Allen Newell and Herb Simon in inventing linked-list data structures for representing complex information.
Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science is celebrating its 25th year as a stand-alone college within CMU.
Herb Simon, associate dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now known as the Tepper School of Business), established Tech’s first Computation Center with the help of its first director, Alan Perlis.
JIM MORRIS , S’63 (Professor of Computer Science) played a significant role as the intellectual founder of our current university, bringing in Allen Newell from the RAND Corporation and recruiting Alan Perlis.
ALLEN NEWELL , IA’57 (U.A. and Helen Whitaker professor of computer science, interviewed in 1991) is one of the co-founders of Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science who invented linked-list data structures for representing complex information.
Computing came to CMU and GSIA in the early 1950s, with the arrival of the university’s first computer, an IBM 650 with magnetic-drum memory.
The characters at the other end of the campus didn’t have the good sense to decide they wanted the computer down in their environment, so it was mostly the people at CMU and GSIA who embraced computing.
Allen Newell, IA’57
They pushed for a more user-oriented approach rather than building computers.
1956 and 1957
Perlis
Concern for management science with no concern for numerical computing and total concern with non-numerical stuff, including human behavior.
Simon predicted that computers would be used for everything and remake corporations.
GSIA, psychology, humanities, social sciences

No, he did not.
It was supposed to have a heavy dose of research, research, research.
Al Perlis
Take courses for two years and then look for a research advisor.
They felt the curriculum was more like an undergraduate program than what they came to graduate school for.
Al Perlis
The student should start on the critical path as early as possible.
Faculty members started matching students with research advisors immediately upon their arrival, starting in 1969.
Mellon College of Science
In 1967
Faculties do not normally respond to such a situation.
SHAW is a person mentioned in the text, but no specific information is provided about who they are or their role. However, based on the context of the conversation, it can be inferred that Shaw believes that starting early on the critical path is important for degree progress.
The text does not provide specific details about what this curriculum change entailed, but it mentions that it happened due to insights related to critical path analysis. It seems that the change involved matching students with research advisors as soon as they arrive and expecting them to start doing research right away.
Porter Hall is mentioned in the text, but no specific location within CMU is provided. However, based on the context of the conversation, it can be inferred that Porter Hall was part of a new addition to the university and shared space with Civil Engineering.
Dan Siewiorek is mentioned in the text as Buhl University Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science at CMU. No specific information about his role or accomplishments are provided, but it can be inferred that he joined the faculty in 1972.
Jordan is mentioned as a professor of electrical engineering at CMU. In 1969, they became the head of the Electrical Engineering Department.
According to Siewiorek's statement, there was a strong culture of collaboration at CMU. It is mentioned that people from different areas of expertise would collaborate on projects and create something greater than the sum of their individual contributions.
In this context, 'critical path' refers to the sequence of steps or tasks that must be completed in order for a project to finish on time. According to Shaw, it is important to start working on this path as early as possible.
The text does not provide a specific reason for the curriculum change, but it mentions that insights from critical path analysis played a role. It seems that this insight led to changes involving students and research advisors.
Porter Hall is mentioned as the location where both floors of what was then the 'new' addition were occupied by CMU. It also shared space with Civil Engineering, and it seems that students and staff from the Computation Center would intermingle with those in offices.
Jordan
Alan Perlis came up with the idea of creating joint appointments because he wanted to help the small Computer Science Department grow, while the larger Electrical Engineering Department was not interested in expanding.
Raj Reddy
Half of the tenured faculty members left because they were attracted to opportunities at other universities.
Joe Traub
Joe Traub's number one priority was to hire some great faculty.
Joe Traub invited 30 people to join the Computer Science Department in his first year as department head.
Dan Sieworiek
Shaw
She rounded up some other students and a dolly, and they moved chairs one evening because it was easier than getting it done by official means.
The thing about Carnegie that was so different from other universities was that it was so easy to get things done—to make joint appointments, for instance.
She joined the faculty when she graduated in 1972.
There was work on programming language design, better ways to build compilers and operating systems research. AI was concerned with problem solving and chess, things like that.
DARPA funding started to be significantly augmented with the help of Allen Newell and Raj Reddy. As Raj and others became prominent in the Department of Computer Science, they also had tremendous influence in other departments, such as Psychology, and later had influence elsewhere, such as the College of Fine Arts.
$2 million—in 1971 dollars—$1.8 million from DARPA and $200,000 from CMU.
We worked hard to diversify and increase our external funding by some $1 million, a good part of that coming from NSF.
$2 million
DARPA

Siewiorek was co-lead on the construction of Cm*
A.M. Turing Award
Simon
He became interested in human-computer interaction and began a long relationship with PARC
Xerox Alto
The authors are Newell and Raj Reddy.
The Alto was a very important thing for computer science, although there never was a scientific publication issued on it.
Raj Reddy wanted to have these machines in his environment because he and Newell were knowledgeable about the design of the Alto.
George Pake is the founder of Xerox PARC.
Raj Reddy and Newell went to IBM because DEC and Xerox were unavailable for help.
The goal of CMU's 'three-M' machine was to be a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.
In the '60s, computer science was quite unstructured while in the '70s it became much more project-oriented.
DARPA's new director didn't care for A.I., which led to a reduction in Traub's budget.
Traub had an emergency plan in place when his budget got reduced, which included a threat to cut it further to $1.2 million.
Traub
more than 30 faculty members and 100 graduate students
Office and laboratory space scattered in Wean and Doherty halls emerged as a serious concern
16 faculty members who share offices
The graduate student offices were overcrowded so severely that, in some cases, there is no room for a desk per student
Nico said the Computer Science Department was sort of like a torus, with a cone on top. The surface area of the torus was allowing the faculty to collaborate with other faculty members.
Nico said the department head’s job was to keep the administration off of the backs of the faculty
Development of a high-speed computer network that would reach virtually every room on campus, along with a GUI-based computing environment, and providing networked PCs or workstations for 7,000 students, faculty members and employees.
Nico
Jim Morris, Al Spector, Satya (Mahadev Satyanarayanan), and others worked on the Andrew network and file system.
One idea from the Andrew project was a centralized or cloud-based system for files, which has since become widely used globally.
The high-bandwidth connection and advanced technology of the Andrew network made it an envy for other universities, attracting world-class students.
Research focused on programming languages, hardware and architecture, operations performance and analysis, robotics, AI, and theory.
The committee pointed out that the university was strong in systems and artificial intelligence but weak in theory.
Nico brought in Dana Scott, who further expanded the department's expertise by bringing in other renowned individuals.
Despite being a programming language guy, Nico was able to cater to various research interests and needs of the growing departments.
Satya (Mahadev Satyanarayanan, CS’79,’83) contributed significantly to the Andrew network and file system at Carnegie-Mellon.
Satya's work from the Andrew days continues to influence the field, with many of his ideas becoming global solutions widely used today.
A visiting committee
Because he wanted to improve Carnegie-Mellon's weakness in theory.
The financial situation with the Thatcher government in the U.K. was bad, and he received a professorship offer from Nico Habermann at CMU.
He said that the good times were over.
Because they became application-driven and wanted to focus on specific, practical applications.
He became the first director of the SEI
Because Nico and his team wrote a proposal for it, and other institutions also wanted to host it.
Carnegie-Mellon
He was a lead author of the proposal.
The lead author of the proposal was Nico Habermann.
$7.2 million to $15.3 million
There were scarce resources for the department, despite its significant research funding.
Shaw was recruited by Nico Habermann to become the chief scientist of SEI and spent most of his time there for four or five years.
The department was a 'misfit' due to its significant budget, which was 80% of the college budget and didn't fit into traditional department structure.
Nico Habermann wrote a proposal for the Software Engineering Institute, which was accepted. He also became its first director and taught there.
$7.2 million to $15.3 million
Morris revered Nico Habermann and considered him a great teacher, researcher, and director.
The department faced challenges due to its significant budget, which was 80% of the college budget and didn't fit into traditional department structure.
Nico Habermann was unhappy with budgeting for the Computer Science Department because there were scarce resources.
It was a politically fraught issue because the Computer Science Department had research funding that didn't fit into the traditional department structure of CMU.
Scott thought that Computer Science was wagging the dog, meaning its needs were not always being met by the administrative decisions made by the Mellon College of Science.
According to Scott, Computer Science needed different types of laboratories than what are called 'wet sciences' do.
The decisions made by Mellon College of Science weren't always meeting the needs of Computer Science because it was exploding with research funding and didn't fit into the traditional department structure.
The term 'wet sciences' refers to laboratories that require a lot of physical resources, such as chemicals or biological materials.
According to Morris, the Computer Science Department was exploding with research funding because it was something CMU had never seen before and wasn't fitting into the traditional department structure.
Scott believes that Computer Science needs different types of laboratories than what are called 'wet sciences' do, which suggests a need for more specialized resources.
Nico Habermann's dissatisfaction with budgeting indicates that there were not enough resources available to meet the needs of the Computer Science Department.

Shafi was born in 1959 in New York City.
Her family returned to Israel where Shafi attended grade school in Tel Aviv. Her parents were Israeli, and her joint American/Israeli citizenship presaged the two countries that would play such an important role in her research.
In high school she was especially interested in physics, mathematics and literature.
Shafi enrolled in graduate school in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, without knowing what she wanted to study.
She began to see that her interests lay in theoretical areas. She soon met a group of enthusiastic young theoretical computer scientists – including Eric Bach, Faith Ellen, Mike Luby, Jeff Shallit, Vijay Vazirani and her Turing Award co-recipient Silvio Micali.
Her master's work was with Michael Powell and David Patterson, studying the optimal instruction set for the RISC architecture.
She had a summer internship at the RAND Corporation in Los Angeles. She loved living on Venice Beach, but her seduction by California wasn’t complete until she drove up the coast road one weekend and entered Berkeley for the first time.

Shafi graduated from Berkeley in 1984 and went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a postdoc, then became a faculty member. She was appointed as the RSA Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1997.
Shafi began a parallel career as a Professor of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel in 1992.
Shafi, with her husband and computer scientist Nir Shavit and their two sons, somehow divide their time between the two institutes, spending about three years at a time in each country.
It was an exciting time when Shafi came to M.I.T because she joined a group with similar research interests: Micali had arrived, and Benny Chor, Oded Goldreich, Ron Rivest and Mike Sipser were there.
With Goldreich and Micali [ 4 ], Shafi investigated whether the notion of a pseudorandom number generator could be generalized so that one could generate exponentially many bits (or equivalently, a function) pseudorandomly.
They also showed how to provably transform a pseudorandom number generator into a pseudorandom function generator. These ideas had applications to the (then) new field of Learning Theory, providing examples of things that cannot be learned.
This definition was in itself important, and it is why we understand today what it means for a block cipher such as AES to be secure.
Shafi's research had applications to the (then) new field of Learning Theory.
Their ideas provided examples of things that cannot be learned.
An interactive proof, as defined by Shafi and Micali, is a process in which a prover convinces a verifier of the correctness of a mathematical proposition with overwhelming probability if and only if the proposition is correct.
The first ACM SIGACT Gödel Prize was awarded to Shafi, Micali (and later Rackoff) for their work on interactive proofs and zero-knowledge proofs.
The main idea behind 'no knowledge' in interactive proofs, as suggested by Shafi and Micali, is that the verifier should not gain any new information about why a statement is true during an interaction with the prover.
The first example of zero-knowledge interactive proofs was given by Shafi using quadratic residuosity.
Goldwasser recalls introducing zero-knowledge proofs with Micali.
The interactive proof notion given by Babai and Moran uses public coins, while that of Shafi and Sipser uses private coins. However, they later proved that the two notions are equivalent.
Michael Sipser suggested the name 'interactive proof', and he also worked with Shafi to prove that the interactive proof notion using private coins is equivalent to the one using public coins.
Shafi's work on zero-knowledge proofs led to a huge research program in the community that continues to this day, including results showing that distrusting parties can compute a function of all their inputs without learning any knowledge about other people’s inputs beyond what follows from the value of the function.
The main contribution of Shafi's work on zero-knowledge proofs was defining 'no knowledge' as simulatability, which was a very important concept in interactive proof systems.
Two or more provers who cannot talk with each other.
Two provers are sufficient.
The existence of these proofs (with certain parameters) implies a hardness of approximation result for certain NP-complete languages.
If the size of a maximum clique in a graph can be approximated within a constant factor, then all of NP can be accepted in nearly polynomial time.

The concept of a probabilistically checkable proof.
Shafi worked with Mihir Bellare, Carsten Lund and Alexander Russell.
The computational problem that quantum computers have not been able to attack yet is approximating the shortest vector size in an integer lattice. This problem forms the basis of public-key cryptography.
Shafi and Goldreich showed that it is unlikely for the approximation problem to be NP-hard by providing an especially succinct interactive proof for this problem.
Property testing is a subject introduced by Shafi, Goldreich and Dana Ron. It involves determining whether a given object (like a graph) has a certain property or if it's far from any other objects with that property after examining only a small number of locations.
Shafi, along with Yael Tauman Kalai and Guy Rothblum, introduced a practical way to delegate the computation of small-depth functions.
One example of an NP-complete property that can be tested by property testers is 3-coloring, which involves coloring a graph with three colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
The theme of approximation is present in various aspects of Shafi's work. For instance, she has worked on problems related to approximating the shortest vector size in an integer lattice and fine-tuning some PCP parameters for improved results.
Goldwasser worked with Mihir Bellare, Carsten Lund and Alexander Russell to define the concept of a probabilistically checkable proof.
Shafi's recent research primarily revolves around how to delegate computation to an untrusted 'cloud' computer, which is one of the most important areas in cryptography today.
Dr. Shafi's recent research focuses on how a user can delegate computation to a very fast but untrusted 'cloud' computer.
Dr. Shafi, along with her colleagues, proposed a practical formulation for delegating computation of small-depth functions.
The 'one-time program' model obfuscates a program so it can be executed only for a prescribed number of executions, assuming a special kind of universal secure hardware.
Dr. Shafi proposed 'token-based obfuscation' as a new paradigm for general function obfuscation.
Dr. Shafi has been focusing on protection against 'side-channel attacks', where an adversary can get information not part of the stream of bits specified by a protocol.
Dr. Shafi, along with Adi Akavia and Vaikuntanathan, had the first results on this topic.
The result from Dr. Shafi, Akavia, and Vaikuntanathan marked the start of this research effort.
