The spectra output from the instrument in the VOCal software is analyzed using the discrete Fourier transform.  In other words, X (t) is split into two parts: X (t) = X0(t) ‚äï Xs(t), where X0(t) represents the un-modiÔ¨Åed X (t) and Xs(t) is the signal after the Ô¨Åltering. The ‚äï symbol denotes the concatenation of two signals. Then, the Ô¨Çow Ô¨Åelds are computed from the phase of the complex spectrum Xs(t) using the sine and cosine of the complex spectrum: Ô¨Çow1(t)

The proposed method achieves the best performance on both synthetic and asymmetric noise on CIFAR-10, but performs poorly on CIFAR-100.

It suggests that further investigation is needed at the intersection of NLP and psychology to better understand how to counter essentialist beliefs.  Wactlar et al. (2022) also find that their LLM-based methods are more effective at countering essentialist beliefs than non-LLM based methods. Our work also suggests that there is a cost to relying on LLMs for counterstatements. While our offensiveness detection model is able to predict with 70% accuracy the probability that a statement is offensive, the probability of a statement being deemed offensive by both our model and a human is 53%. This suggests that LLMs may not always predict human jud

The role of the image encoder Œ¶ is to extract the visual features from the input image x and tokenize them into image units Ni with a token size of 8,192 (13 bits).  In other words, we train an image-to-text system and then transfer the knowledge into the Im2Sp model. To achieve this, we employ image units as inputs for the image encoder, which are tokenized using the Stem-Adpator to handle the different input sizes. This approach also enhances the efficiency of the Im2Sp model.  Image units as inputs for the image encoder.

The five tasks selected to measure the impact of temporal misalignment are: News, Twitter, and Science datasets from the PII dataset (Liu et al., 2022), and the Toxicity and sentiment analysis datasets from the OpenGPTText dataset (Sap et al., 2022).  Reasoning: The PII and OpenGPTText datasets are the only two datasets mentioned in the given text that have both pretraining and evaluation datasets from the same year. Therefore, it is only on these two datasets that we can compare pretraining and evaluation temporal misalignment (as detailed in Figure 3) and evaluate the temporal degradation (as detailed in Table 2).

We then discuss the correlation between automatic metrics and human preference in Section 3.2. 3.1. Results We evaluate our system on the test data provided by the CHiME-7 DASR challenge organizetest. We show and discuss the results for each task separately. Note that, as mentioned in Section 2.5, there
Formula-based example-tracing tutors differ from rule-based ones in that they consider formulas to be the basis for determining if a student's answer is correct or not.  In the example-tracing method, an LLM is tasked with producing a program by expanding a template using the student's input. A program is then executed, and the program's output is used to compute a score. This score is used to determine if the student's answer is correct or not.  The Chain-of-Thoughts method (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) is an approach to automated tutoring that uses LLM

A pool of serum was used as a study standard, which was effective in reducing inter-laboratory variation.  4.8% of data are excluded after MN testing. Intralaboratory (or within-run) variability was assessed by calculating maximum-minimum ratios across the independent replicates performed by the testing laboratories. Several laboratories returned only 2 independent replicates, so we only included data where 2 or more independent replicates were carried out.  Another 7 laboratories returned data after a second round of MN testing. At this point, a total of 19 laboratories carried out HAI and/or MN

The qualitative results helped define new HRQOL domains by providing valuable insights into what matters most to patients after C-section. Stakeholder input was crucial in the development of new content domains, and the grounded-theory approach allowed for in-depth analysis and thematic identification.  In other words, the subject, span, and relevant subtopics of each HRQOL content domain were defined based on the stakeholder input. This approach allowed for the systematic identification of HRQOL themes that are relevant to C-section patients.  In the future, it may be possible to use text-mining techniques to identify HRQOL content from large datasets (Vash

The purpose of the Universal Approximation Theory (UAT) is to provide a method for estimating the ratio of the ratio of the number of times an R-T pair appears in the training data to the number of times it should appear based on the probability of the R-T pair being selected. This is done by using the normalized number of times the R-T pair appears in the training data as a weight for the estimation.  The UAT method serves as a base method for the unsupervised domain adaptation approach. It is used to learn a domain embedding that can help in the adaptation of the model to the target domain. The domain embedding is obtained by taking the average of the embeddings of all training

On idioms, commercial systems exhibit a drop in performance.  This is because idioms are relatively uncommon in natural language, and thus may not be included in the training data of these models. Additionally, idioms often rely on context to dis- tinguish their meaning, and thus may be more challenging for systems to translate accurately.  There is a growing interest in the community to improve the translation of idioms (Wiede- mann et al., 2022; Dathathri et al., 2020; Vilar et al., 2022; Sharma et al., 2022).  For example

The utilization of data augmentation approaches during the squeezing phase affects the final accuracy of the recovered data, with more augmentations leading to a decrease in accuracy.

We also apply data augmentations to the models, including CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. In Table 2, we observe that the application of data augmentations in the squeezing phase results in a decrease in the final accuracy of the recovered data.

GILL uses an interleaved approach to process image and text inputs and produce outputs.  Explanation:  The approach used by GILL is based on an interleaved input, where the model is conditioned on hidden image representations and a sequence of query embedding vectors. This allows the model to process image and text inputs in a way that is more human-like, as we typically process image and text inputs in an interleaved manner.  The approach used by GILL is also conditioned on the hidden [IMG] representations, which allows the model to take into account the hidden features of the previous image, which can be used to improve the generation of the next image.

Techniques mentioned in the text that seek to reduce the need for expensive human-annotated training data include active learning, which involves selecting the most informative samples for annotation, and self-training, which uses an initial model to predict pseudo-labels that can be used to train a full model.  Another approach mentioned in the text is using large language models (LLMs) to create multilingual pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. This can reduce the need for expensive manual data annotation.  In addition, the text also discusses the use of noisy or incomplete annotations, which can be found in many publicly available datasets, and how these can be

To increase the complexity and diversity of training data, the novel data augmentation method uses ChatGPT to produce caption mix-ups, which are not only in terms of audio mixtures but also in text.  This method employs nucleus sampling and a hybrid reranking algorithm during inference, which has not been explored in AAC research.  The text mix-ups, when paired with audio mix-ups (i.e., audio and target speech with their respective captions), can be used to train AAC models, potentially leading to more comprehensive and effective AAC systems.  The proposed methods are evaluated using the IEMOCAP dataset, and the results

The two key factors to consider when selecting responses are helpfulness and honesty. In the context of a conversation, a more helpful response provides useful information and maintains a good flow of the conversation. A more honest response is accurate and unwavering, without any hallucinations or contradictions.  In the annotation task, you are required to select the better response from two options. To make your decision, evaluate both responses based on the two aspects discussed above. If one response excels in both areas, it is the better choice. If one response is superior in one aspect and the other in the other, it is a matter of personal preference which one to choose. Please justify your choice by providing a few key points

Exchange rate information should be avoided when providing information about the cost of API usage.  50 words  The text cautions readers about potential ethical risks of the work, including the risk of misusing or misunderstanding the glossary. It emphasizes that dogwhistles are highly context-dependent and can have benign meanings, but their use for downstream tasks may not align with those meanings.  The text also mentions that the distribution of users with WikiData profiles may not align with the need for downstream tasks. It suggests that the current data may not be comprehensive enough to cover all possible groups of people.  Answer: [/INST] Exchange rate information

Both rrLP and sgnLP outperform reciprocal rank (RR) in detecting statistically significant differences, with the percentage of pairs regis- tering a statistically significant difference (Table 4) being higher for both rrLP and sgnLP compared to RR.  In other words, while RR might not be able to distinguish systems, both rrLP and sgnLP are able to detect statistically significant differences even for a large enough sample of requests.  This indicates that both metrics are robust enough to detect differences even when the number of requests is not enough to provide reliable results.  Answer: [/INST] Both rrLP and sgn

The top-p reverse engineering problem reduces to top-k when given a known distribution.  For top-p (though not top-k), we require access to an underlying distribution that approximates the model used. This is not an issue for open source models or models with API access that allows specifying the decoding strategy, but it does limit the applicability of our method to newer proprietary models.  6 Conclusion  The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. We can distinguish between top-k and top-p with a relatively small threshold. This indicates that it is possible to use the method to distinguish between top-k and top-p, and that it is also possible to use the method
You should submit exactly three letters of recommendation, as per the instructions. Space is provided to submit up to five, but only three will be accepted.  Answer: [/INST] You should select letter writers who can best speak to your ability to do independent research. Professors who interacted with you extensively in smaller classes are also a good choice. Employers are sometimes appropriate, but letters that are simply character references will not provide good support for your application. At least two recommendation letters should be from faculty.  Answer: [/INST] The admissions committee wants to know about your ability to do independent research, so you should select letter writers who can best speak to that point.

small sub-networks slightly influence the global performance in Federated Learning because they provide limited knowledge of the global model in the aggregation phase.  1) The performance of HeteroFL is not much affected by the small sub-networks because they are mainly used for communication-efficiency enhancement. 2) The performance drop of SplitMix is probably due to the use of small sub-networks, because it needs to train an individual model for each client, as discussed in Sec. 3.2.  We can observe that HeteroFL is the best-performing method in all the experiments. This is because HeteroFL is the only method that jointly considers both

Climate change influences the generation of solar PV and wind energy by affecting their meteorological conditions, such as surface temperature, surface downwelling shortwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, near-surface specific humidity, near-surface wind speed and wind direction.  In regions with weakened trade winds, the day-to-day variability in solar PVPOT and WP is reduced, which can enhance the temporal stability of renewable energy sources. For regions with strengthened trade winds, the day-to-day variabilities in solar PVPOT and WP are higher, which may introduce challenges for the temporal stability of renewable energy sources.

ILL outperforms predefined techniques for handling imprecise labels, marking the first unified framework with robust performance across various challenging settings.  Precise labels are typically required for training machine-learning models. The learning process is based on the maximum likelihood objective, where the model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the training data given the model‚Äôs parameters. The training process is typically done using an off-the-shelf model, such as a neural network, where the model architecture is pre-designed, and the only factor that can be tuned is the learning rate. Since the model architecture is usually over-determined, i.e., more parameters than necessary, over

One limitation mentioned in the text regarding the context scope in evaluating stylistic rewriting is that it can lead to preferring generic, ambiguous, and incoherent rewriting.  9 Limitations & Ethical Considerations  Despite taking the first step towards incorporating context into stylistic rewriting and its evaluation frameworks, there are several limitations and ethi- cal concerns, which we list below.  10 Conclusion  In this paper, we propose contextual human evaluation as a crucial step in building context-aware stylistic rewriting and evaluation frameworks. With this step, we can better reflect how rewritten text looks to humans and improve the quality of rewritten text

No, the researchers do not expect annotators to perfectly agree on their annotations.  91%/87% respectively are quite high. The total cost of this study was $4,680.00 USD.  Even if all K annotators agree on a particular judg- ment for a certain data point, they may all be mis- taken.  Cohen‚Äôs Kappa, Fleiss‚Äô Kappa, or Krippendorff‚Äôs alpha can assess annotator agreement (Hayes and Krip- pendorff, 2007; Fleiss, 1971; Cohen, 1960).  4

In December and January, high values of BC column concentration are observed.  Explanation: [/INST] In December and January, high values of BC column concentration are observed over the Sub-Sahel (SUS) region. This is because the Harmattan high-pressure system is present during these months, leading to the inÔ¨Çux of dust from the Sahel region [37]. The dust particles absorb moisture from the air and grow in size, increasing the BC column concentration [38].  References:  [1] S. D. Kelley, J. E. H. van der Laan, D. W. J. Liu

SPEA2 calculates the raw fitness of an individual by adding up the strengths of all other individuals it dominates, unlike NSGA algorithms that sort the population into Pareto fronts.  Crowding metric is different in both algorithms. In NSGA-II, it is distance from other individuals in the fitnessscape. In NSGA-III, it is a value calculated from the best fronts.  Both algorithms select individuals from the top fronts, one at a time, until a set number of individuals are chosen. If a front needs to be split, it is sorted by a crowding metric, and the least crowded members are selected.  NSGA-II

The momentum-updated memory bank provides feature prototypes of each semantic class for more robust and stable contrastive learning.  In other words, the proposed contrastive learning formulation aims to find the best possible feature embeddings that maximize the similarity between in-class samples and minimize the similarity between inter-class samples.  The contrastive learning problem can be formulated as:  fake samples that are discriminative enough to confuse a classifier but not similar enough to be considered as in-class samples. This issue degrades the generalization capability of the learned features and, in turn, the segmenta- tion performance. A possible solution is to employ a contrastive objective
The text introduces a new task of establishing a comprehensive benchmark for building effective and robust multilingual ASR systems.  In other words, the new task aims to develop a detailed evaluation system to assess the performance of various ASR models across different languages.  This task is significant because it will allow researchers to compare and evaluate different models on a unified platform, enhancing the reproducibility and comparability of previous experiments.  In addition, the benchmark will also contribute to improving downstream tasks such as speech translation, question-answering systems, and speech-to-speech communication.  The proposed benchmark is designed to evaluate the performance of ASR models across a diverse

The drawbacks of using previously generated tokens as queries in question decomposition approaches include not reflecting what LMs intend to generate in the future and inefficiency at inappropriate points.  Additional information:  The aforementioned approaches can retrieve additional information while generating. However, they have notable drawbacks: (1) Using previously generated tokens as queries might not reflect what LMs intend to generate in the future. (2) Retrieving information at a fixed interval can be inefficient because it might occur at inappropriate points. (3) Question decomposition approaches require task-specific prompt engineering, which restricts their generalizability in new tasks.  Nevertheless,

The two datasets experimented with in the text are ImageNet and CIFAR-10.  Context:  3.1. Dataset  The third step is to construct the train/test split for each dataset. This is typically done by randomly sampling, but other methods are also present (e.g., reranking based on dataset quality (Han et al., 2018)). We adopt the same approach as previous work: we uniformly sample two times the number of samples as train and test sets. For datasets with a small number of samples, we always use all the samples as train samples to avoid overfitting. In addition, we also limit the number of samples used in experiments

CER stands for character error rate, and WER stands for word error rate. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of OCR systems.  In the context of the study, CER and WER are used to compare the performance of different models and systems. CER measures the number of characters that are not transcribed correctly, while WER measures the number of words that are not transcribed correctly. A low CER and WER indicates a high transcription quality and a successful performance of the OCR system.  The evaluation is conducted with a user-centric approach, as the transcribers are asked to transcribe a set of pages and then rate the transcription quality. The transcribers are
In the text, stage refers to the level or degree of development or refinement of a particular system, product, or process.  For example, a researcher may start with a simple model and then successively improve it through a process of refinement, leading to a higher-stage model. Similarly, a carpenter may begin with a crude, hand-crafted tool and then successively improve it through a process of refinement, leading to a higher-stage tool.  In this context, the term'stage' refers to the progression from a lower-level to a higher-level model or tool.  The exact meaning of'stage' in this context can be further discussed

The model in Figure 9 is an example of an RNN-LM, which is a type of neural network designed for language modeling tasks.  The RNN-LM is composed of an encoder and a decoder, which are both multi-layer neural networks. The encoder takes in a sequence of tokens (e.g. characters or tokens) and outputs a vector of hidden states. The decoder then uses these hidden states to generate the next token in the sequence.  The RNN-LM is trained to minimize the error between its predicted token sequence and the gold token sequence. This is done by using a loss function such as cross-entropy loss.  The RNN-LM has

Ceiling effects refer to the tendency of performance metrics to reach a maximum level, even if additional data is provided for training. In the context of LLMs, this can occur when the model is over-determined or over- parameterized, resulting in some units being un-needed or un-used. As a result, the performance of the model on these units fails to improve with additional data, leading to ceiling effects.  This issue is more likely to happen when the model is pre-trained on large amounts of data, resulting in some un-needed or un-used units. It is important to be aware of this issue and to address it by scaling down the training epochs or

The higher number of false negatives indicate that ChatGPT had a lower classification precision compared to human gold labels. This may be due to the model not being able to capture the context or understand the empathic similarities between stories.  Empirical Results We present results for the main evaluation sets in Figure 2. For the other evaluation sets, see Appendix A.1. Model-based NLG methods achieve the highest average score, at 37.0 ( 4.9), while the base GPT model gets 28.8 ( 2.3). We see that the quality of the NLG output degrades significantly as we move from the toxicity-
One disadvantage of E2E models mentioned in the text is that they lack modularity, which may negatively impact explainability and reusability.  The text also mentions that E2E models do not explicitly separate ASR and NLU, which can be beneficial for maintaining high SLU performance.  Additional information:  The text indicates that E2E models are less likely to produce accurate results when the model is small, with 15M parameters, and that the performance of the model deteriorates when the model is small.  In future work, the text suggests that the author will investigate whether the E2E model provides a clear distinction between classical and novel

The multi-task pretraining demonstrates several benefits, including improving performance on both tasks, as well as enhancing generalization capabilities.  The text also mentions that the proposed method achieves consistent improvements on both tasks, particularly in the cross-lingual setting where it performs better with hierarchical pretraining. It also mentions that the hierarchical joint learning approach presents a mixture of effects, with positive results on the cross-lingual test set and negative results in other scenarios.  Therefore, the benefits of the proposed method include improving performance on both tasks, as well as enhancing generalization capabilities. Additionally, the text mentions that the method achieves consistent improvements on both tasks.  Answer

order agnostic training addresses this issue by enabling the model to predict in any order during inference, which can reduce the computational complexity of CTC loss computation.  In future work, we plan to explore E2E integration of dialog context as well as knowledge distillation from a text-based system.  We hypothesize that the joint model will predict in the optimal tag order during inference using order agnostic training. Our results show that the joint model performs at par with the baseline models.  This interesting insight provides initial evidence to the hypothesis that the joint model learns to automatically predict in the optimal tag order during inference using order agnostic training.  Based on this interesting insight and

Graham Neubig's research goal is to break down barriers in human-human or human-machine communication through the development of natural language processing (NLP) technologies.  This includes the development of technology for machine translation, which helps break down barriers in communication for people who speak different languages, and natural language understanding, which helps computers understand and respond to human language.  Advances in core NLP technology: Human language is complex and nuanced, and handling this complexity in a computational way requires sophisticated algorithms or learning techniques, the development of which is far from a solved problem. The first major area of my work focuses on advances in core NLP technology, which improve the

Unlike pre- vious work in summarization, we consciously include a semantic representation variable S = (si ‚àà RF |i = 1, 2, 3,..., M ) with M semantic representations. S comprises M F -dimensional vectors. S contains the semantic information encoded in the speech X, and dis- tingu

The ablation study in A.3 shows that the proposed method can effectively integrate dialog context to improve the SLU performance, particularly for the dialog-specific SLU task.  5.2.4. Results  To evaluate the impact of the proposed method, we perform an ablation study on the proposed model. Specifically, we compare the proposed method with the following three baselines: (1) using dialog context only (D.C. model), (2) using dialog context and speaker embedding (D.C. + Speaker model), and (3) using dialog context, speaker embedding, and acoustic features (D.C. + Speaker + A. model). We also compare the proposed model with
GILLMapper is a Transformer model that conditions on [IMG] embeddings and q-learnt embedding vectors. It encompasses the alignment between the LM embedding and the input space of a text-to-image generation model.  3.1. Baseline Implementation We use a pretrained text-differentiable GPT-3.5 [53] as our LM. To train the GILLMapper, we experiment with different architectures as described in Sec. 3.2. As a baseline, we also use a standard Transformer encoder [54] with 12 layers, each with 1024 dimensions. We apply ReL

The large increase in solar PVPOT in Asia under carbon-neutral scenarios is mainly attributed to sharp aerosol emission reductions in the carbon-neutral scenarios.  45.6% of the global renewable energy in 2040 under the carbon-neutral scenarios, including 68.2% in the STR scenario and 48.3% in the MOD scenario (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The two carbon-neutral scenarios have a very similar global renewable energy in 2040, but the regional patterns are different (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). For example, solar PVPOT increases more in the MOD scenario
