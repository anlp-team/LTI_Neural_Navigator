The 'Grandfather' policy refers to a situation where a student can choose to graduate under policies that were in effect when they entered their program, as long as they have not completed all the requirements for their degree.  This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.  For more information: See CMU’

Berliner's first championship in correspondence chess was unique because it lasted for four years, from 1965 to 1969.  Context:  Chess was a wonderful way to discipline his mind. "You're forced to deal with a certain level of reality," Berliner says. "It's up to you to dosomething about it. If you're playing chess, and you've made a move, and it's not working, you have to deal with that. You can't just say, 'Well, this is not working, I'm going to go get a beer.'"   # # #  Camp

MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 4.  The absolute minimum difference of 302.2 mg/m2 was recorded in September, and the minimum relative difference was obtained in April (34.3%).  For instance, a high correlation coefﬁcient and large RMSE are obtained for dust com- parisons in SAH, BOD, and PEH region. It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in the BOD region. A good correlation coefﬁcient (R = 0.8
Unusual or unforeseen circumstances refer to situations that are not typical or expected, and which may require special consideration or accommodations.  In the context of the text, it means that the model should be able to handle scenarios that are not included in the training data, or that are not typical of the situations in which the model is being used.  For example, if the model is trained on questions and answers related to specific topics, but the user is asking a question that is unrelated to those topics, it may be considered an unusual or unforeseen circumstances.  In such cases, the model should be able to recognize that it is an unusual question and respond in a way that is relevant and

The role of the image encoder Φ in the Im2Sp model is to extract visual features from an input image and downsample them to a fixed size.  In more detail, the image encoder Φ takes an input image x and outputs a sequence of vector features fv = Φ(x) ∈ R(H/P ∗W/P +1)×D, where P represents the patch size of ViT and D represents the embedding dimension. These features are used to train the Im2Sp model.  We also use image units, which are similar to speech units, to improve efficiency. We tokenize the input image into image units by applying Vector Quantization (VQ) techniques

A formula-based example-tracing tutor is different from a rule-based one because the former uses formulas to determine the next step, whereas the latter relies on a set of pre-defined rules.  In a rule-based system, when a rule is applied, it will always apply the same action based on the specified condition.

One of the challenges mentioned is the cost and time required to rely solely on humans for explanations.  Explanation: Relying solely on humans for explanations is costly and time-consuming. To explore the limits of context-aware reasoning, we generated a challenge set of counterfactual contexts (COBRACORPUS-CF) that inverts the offensiveness of statements, making it challenging for models to provide relevant context.

The use of a serum pool as a study standard was effective in reducing inter-laboratory variation.  Explanation:  The intra-laboratory variability refers to the differences observed within a laboratory, where the same assay and testing protocol are used. Intra-laboratory variability is often greater than inter-laboratory variability (Mager et al., 2015). The use of a serum pool as a study standard can reduce some of this intra-laboratory variability.  The MN assay had intrinsically higher levels of variability within a run, but the inter-laboratory variation was lower.

The experiments on 12 automatic speech recognition, 3 speech translation, and 1 spoken language understanding corpora with discrete speech units achieve reasonably good results in almost all the settings.  The text discusses the results of using discrete speech units in three areas: automatic speech recognition, speech translation, and spoken language understanding. The results show that the use of discrete speech units is effective in improving performance in these areas.  In the experiments, the author used a diverse set of speech corpora, including LibriSpeech, noisy speech, and spontaneous speech. The results show that the discrete speech units are effective in improving performance, even in the presence of background noise.  The use of discrete

The Ph.D. dissertation is the defining feature of a Ph.D. degree.  The three important milestones in completing a Ph.D. dissertation are:  1. Thesis Topic: During the Ph.D. student’s third year, the student should be working hard to find a thesis topic.  2. Proposal: Near the end of the Ph.D. student’s third year, the student will compose a dissertation proposal. In this document, the student will specify a research problem, present a proposed solution, and discuss the work that still must be completed to achieve that solution. The dissertation proposal is the most important document

A model that relies on a long 'warmup' period, where it gradually improves its output quality as it generates more examples.  This model is also known as the 'Blackbox model', since its inner workings are not fully comprehensible to users.  The text suggests that the 'Blackbox model' is commonly used for tasks like question-answering, where the goal is to generate human-readable text from input text.  The author uses the 'Blackbox model' as an example to explain the challenges of training large language models.  Despite its limitations, the 'Blackbox model' has been successful in several practical NLP applications.  The author bel

The purpose of the novel data augmentation method using ChatGPT in AAC models is to produce caption mix-ups, which increase the complexity and diversity of training data. During inference, the proposed method employs nucleus sampling and a hybrid reranking algorithm for better performance.  Nevertheless, the LLM can also generate inappropriate or misaligned information, potentially distracting the model training. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the potential problems derived from the LLMs and to be able to handle them when using them in AAC models.  In summary, this work explores the efficacy of using ChatGPT to generate AAC captions

The main goal of the automatic alignment schemes presented in the text is to reduce the computational complexity of the alignment process.  The schemes include:  1. Blockwise self-conditioned CTC (SC-CTC) - This method employs a blockwise self-conditioned CTC layer to align the intermediate outputs of encoder blocks, which in turn align the intermediate outputs of the encoder stack.  2. Alignment-based rescoring (A-BS) - This approach re-scores the intermediate outputs of the encoder using an explicit alignment model to estimate the alignment between intermediate outputs and the intermediate predictions.  3.

The observation regarding the accuracy of factorized low-rank models when Frobenius decay is applied is that it results in a loss of accuracy compared to full-rank training.  Further research may explore other special cases of low-rank training, such as factorizing only a subset of layers, or using low-rank training in addition to structured pruning. Combining different methods, such as low-rank training and knowledge distillation, may also be explored to improve the accuracy of the resulting factorized model. Although full-rank training is the de facto standard for NN training, low-rank training has many advantages, as shown in this work. It is more efﬁcient in computation

When making this selection, primarily consider these two factors: honesty and Accuracy  The Hallucination Factor: In the Model response, we want the model to avoid hallucinations. A response from the LLM can be considered hallucinated if it contains information not supported by the image and/or is not based on any real-world knowledge. A simple example is a “cats wearing glasses” image, which is not real. A more complex example is a “detailed description of a non-existent object”. In both cases, the LLM is hallucinating. It is important to note that a non-existent object can be described in a more detailed and real

sgnLP performs better than reciprocal rank in detecting statistically significant differences, even when it uses a simple binomial test.  Reason: [/INST] sgnLP performs better than reciprocal rank in detecting statistically significant differences because it uses a binomial test, which is more robust than the Student’s 𝑡-test used in reciprocal rank.  Explanation: The Student’s 𝑡-test is a one-sample t-test that is used to compare the mean of a sample to a known mean. It is not as effective in detecting statistically significant differences because it only considers one sample. On the other

The top-p reverse engineering problem reduces to top-k when given a known distribution.  6 Conclusion  We have devised a methodology for unsupervised inversion of text, i.e., given only the text, to generate the underlying probability distribution from which the text was sampled. Our approach is based on the observation that the distribution from which the text was sampled is the same as the distribution from which the decoding strategy of a language generation system was sampled. We show that by using the ChatGPT model, we can use a known distribution to estimate the p-th quantile of the output distribution of the decoding strategy. We show further that this estimate can be used to improve

The text suggests that small sub-networks slightly influence the global performance in Federated Learning because the degradation caused by the aggregation phase overshadows the effect of small sub-networks.  Explanation: The text discusses the challenges of training a large federated learning model due to memory constraints. To address this issue, it introduces three methods, including FedAvg with a global batch size, which is communication-intensive. The text also introduces a new method, FedPA, which employs a progressive learning rate in the aggregation phase to reduce communication costs. The results show that FedPA achieves similar performance to FedAvg with a global batch size while reducing communication

Climate change influences the generation of solar PV and wind energy by affecting the amount of solar energy that reaches the surface and the wind speed. For example, clouds and aerosols can reduce the amount of solar energy reaching the surface, while climate change can also lead to changes in wind patterns.  In the study, the researchers used a bias-corrected large ensemble of multi-model simulations under an envisioned post-pandemic green recovery to explore the enhancement in solar PV over global land regions, especially in Asia. They found a general enhancement in solar PV over these regions.  The researchers also used a bias-corrected large ensemble of multi-model simulations under an

Expected Calibration Error (ECE) is deﬁned as (cid:12) ECE = ∑Nbins (cid:12). Here accuracyi is the top-1 prediction accuracy in i-th bin, conﬁdencei is the average conﬁdence of pre- dictions in i-th bin, and bi is the fraction of data points in i-th bin.  In other words, ECE measures the (un)calibratedness of the model across different prediction thresholds or bins. A low ECE implies that the model is well-calibrated, i.e., the predicted probabilities match the true labels closely.

First, our models are trained on a limited amount of data, which may not be representative of all the variation in human speech. Second, we do not have the ground truth utterances for our dataset, so we have to rely on self-training to obtain our model. This may introduce some noise in our model. Third, our model is trained on a limited set of tasks, so it may not generalize well to other tasks. Fourth, our evaluation is limited to a single benchmark, and we do not have the ground truth for our evaluation. Finally,

A smaller σ value is used in the experiments for SLURP as the average ratio of audio to text is much higher compared to ASR experiments, and a larger σ value may not be necessary.  Reason: The σ value controls the duration output by the model. A larger σ value will result in the model outputting a duration that is longer than the actual audio length. For ASR experiments, the average ratio of audio to text is 1:1, so the value of σ does not affect training. However, in SLURP, the average ratio of audio to text is 8:1, which is why a larger σ value would not be effective.  Context:

Inverse toxicity filters are crucial because using a positive toxicity filter can introduce new toxic content, as highlighted by Xu et al. (2021). Welbl et al.

Researchers use ChatGPT to employ a novel mix-up data augmentation.  Narasimhan et al. (2022) introduce Flamingo, a visual encoder that can be efficiently fine-tuned for a variety of NLP tasks, and show that it can be used to create visual language models that can process arbitrarily long text sequences. This approach is taken further by Dathathri et al. (2022), who use a Flamingo-based encoder to build a unified model that can process text and image inputs in an end-to-end manner for a variety of NLP tasks.  3 2 0 2 r

The study suggests future work in the field of AI and psychology, as researchers continue to explore the use of AI to enhance human communication and cognition.  Potential future works could include investigating how different types of AI, such as rule-based, machine learning, or hybrid systems, impact the human-machine communication process. Another direction could be incorporating feedback from humans, particularly non-experts, to improve the performance of AI models.  7 REFERENCES  1. Ahn, W. Y., Chung, W. H., & Kim, B. W. (2015).

The first artificial intelligence program, Logic Theorist, was written by Herb Simon, Allen Newell (IA’57), and Cliff Shaw.  This program could solve logic puzzles in the same way a human would solve them. Newell demonstrated that it worked by writing the instructions on 3-by-5 index cards that were manipulated on the kitchen table by Newell, his wife, and a group of Carnegie Tech grad students.  In 1956 and 1957, Simon, Allen Newell (IA’57) and Cliff Shaw of RAND designed the Logic Theorist, a computer program that could develop proofs for theor

The momentum-updated memory bank provides feature prototypes of each semantic class for more robust and stable contrastive learning.  In other words, it can be used to distinguish between two classes with the same feature embeddings but different semantic meanings. In this way, the proposed negative-power contrastive representation learning objective can help the model learn robust representations that are insensitive to random perturbations.  We also find that a higher degree of randomness in the selection of training data, as represented by the random number r, generally leads to better performance, as shown in Table 1. This is likely because a certain degree of randomness helps to prevent over-fit- ting to the training data. We set

The drawbacks of using previously generated tokens as queries in question decomposition approaches include: (1) It may not reflect what LMs intend to generate in the future. (2) It can be inefficient because it occurs at inappropriate points. (3) Question decomposition approaches require task-specific prompt engineering, which restricts their generalizability in new tasks.  Nevertheless, with the strong performance of LLaVA in the OTT-QA task, we believe that our method can be a good empirical approach for further development of question decomposition and query decomposition approaches towards better integration with LLMs.  Answer: [/INST] The drawbacks of using previously generated tokens as

The 'Immigration Course (IC)' is an orientation that provides an opportunity for students to meet potential advisors, describe their interests and areas of expertise. It is a platform for faculty to describe their interests and areas of expertise.  For many years, these talks were called "the Immigration Course (IC)." The intuition behind this name is that the talks help orient newly-arrived students – immigrants into the CMU environment. As a result, some students understood the name to indicate that the talks would be about US immigration and visa requirements. In fact, the talks are about very different topics.  Answer: [/INST]

The ceiling effects arise because RL1 evaluation only considers the top-ranked relevant item and ignores the positions of other relevant items. As a result, a ranking with multiple relevant items will always score higher than a ranking with only one relevant item, even if the second ranking is better.  Ties are common in RL1 evaluation because it only considers the positions of the top-ranked relevant items. In a ranking with multiple relevant items, a tie will occur when all relevant items are ranked the same position, even if they are in a different order.  Lexiprecision, on the other hand, considers all relevant items and assigns a score to each ranking based on its best

GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and ChatGPT  7. Conclusion We propose SELF-REFINE, a method that uses LLMs to provide feedback and refine its output in an iterative manner. This way, SELF-REFINE can generate better outputs without any additional training. We evaluate SELF-REFINE across 7 diverse tasks and show that it outperforms baselines, even when the initial output is weak. We also show that SELF-REFINE is robust to quality of initial outputs. Moving forward, we plan to explore SELF-REFINE in a few-shot setting, in combination with other methods, and in

Evidence-based teaching strategies are methods that are grounded in research about how people learn and use language. These approaches are not limited to specific teaching methods but can be applied to many different teaching contexts and methodologies.  Teaching strategies that are grounded in research about how people learn and use language are called evidence-based teaching strategies.  This approach is also in contrast to the more general search for information on the internet, which is often called 'web search' or 'information retrieval'. Our work focuses on the speciﬁc task of question-answering, and the development of systems that can provide speciﬁc information to answer questions. This task is particularly challenging because

Dynamic Interfaces  The text discusses the incorporation of human participation in the system, making it a two-way system where both the system and human can engage in a discussion. This is different from other works that rely solely on the system for prediction.  In addition, the text also compares the performance of the system with and without human feedback. This allows for a better assessment of the system’s performance in different scenarios.  Wang et al. (2022a) also shows that CoT can achieve com- petitive performance even with invalid reasoning steps in the prompt. This supports the idea that the system should also incorporate human feedback to improve performance.  Fur

order agnostic training addresses the issue of selecting the optimal dialog context order during inference.  The joint model achieves similar results to task-specific classifiers and can effectively integrate dialog context to further improve the SLU performance.  Further research may explore E2E integration of dialog context as well as knowledge distillation from a text-based system.  The model learns to automatically predict in the optimal tag order during inference using order agnostic training.  This work focuses on spoken language understanding (SLU) and explores the integration of dialog context, order agnostic training, and intermediate CTC loss to improve performance.  1https://github.com/VKCOM

Unlike traditional speech summarization models, BASS does not solely rely on acoustic inputs and can instead use semantic inputs, representing a significant improvement in summarization performance.  The proposed BASS model is shown in Figure 1. Different from past work in summarization, we explicitly introduce a semantic representation variable S = (si ∈ RF |i = 1, 2, 3,..., M ), which comprises M F -dimensional vectors. S contains the semantic information encoded in the speech X, and separates the acoustics from the summary. Modifying the input language or ambient environment changes the acoustics, but not the se- mantic. Summaries are generated by
