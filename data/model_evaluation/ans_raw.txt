The smaller σ value in the SLURP experiments is used to alleviate the issue of training instability caused by the large ratio of audio to text length. A higher σ value may encourage large duration outputs, which can be detrimental for SLURP due to the shorter audio duration compared to text length. Using σ = 0.02 for all experiments helps stabilize training.

According to the provided context, there are a few works in academia that caution against the use of detoxification techniques in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These works suggest that detoxification techniques, such as data filters, can reduce model perplexity on underrepresented communities (Xu et al., 2021; Welbl et al., 2021). However, these techniques may also introduce bias in the story selections and filter out meaningful stories (Sap et al., 2019a). Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the potential risks and limitations of detoxification techniques when using them in NLP tasks.

SPEA2 differs from NSGA algorithms in individual selection in that SPEA2 uses a different strategy for selecting the best candidate solutions. While NSGA algorithms use a tournament-based approach to select the fittest candidates, SPEA2 uses a more complex strategy that takes into account the diversity of the candidates. Specifically, SPEA2 uses a diversity-based selection approach that selects the candidates that are most diverse and have the highest potential for improvement. This approach is designed to avoid getting stuck in local optima and to explore a wider range of solutions.

The momentum-updated memory bank in PointDR contributes to contrastive learning by providing feature prototypes of each semantic class, which helps to learn perturbation-invariant representations and leads to a robust and generalizable segmentation model. The memory bank is updated using a momentum coefficient, which affects the performance of contrastive learning. When the momentum value is too large (e.g., 0.999), the memory bank updates too slowly to capture the latest and representative feature embeddings, leading to a decrease in segmentation performance. On the other hand, a smaller momentum value (e.g., 0.98 or 0.99) can result in a more robust and stable contrastive
