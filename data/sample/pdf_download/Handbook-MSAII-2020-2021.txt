 1 Introduction  
The Language Technologies Institute (LTI) has prepared this statement of policies, program 
requirements, guidance, process and procedures for students in the M.S. in Artificial Intelligenc e 
and Innovation (MS AII) program. A copy of this handbook is also available online at  the 
program website: msaii.cs.cmu.edu .   
The University Student guide , The Word, which details university -wide policies, is also 
available  online at www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword .     
Additional resources specific to  graduate students can be found  at 
www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/     
While this handbook i s specific to your academic experience in the MSAII program, there are 
several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their 
time  at Carnegie Mellon University.  Information about The Word, the student handbook, the 
Graduate Education Off ice, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are included in 
an appendix to this handbook.  It is the student’s responsibility to be f amil iar with all policies 
related to their educational and community experience at Carne gie Mellon University.    
1.1 The MS AII Degree 
The M.S. in Artificial Intelligence and  Innovation (MSAII) is a professional master's program 
offered  by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) in the School of Computer Science at 
Carnegie Mellon University. T his program seeks to educate students in the innovative use of 
artificial intelligence  to create practical solutions in a wide v ariety of application areas. As 
artificial intelligence  matures , there is a great need for students who can envision, design, pl an 
and deliver solutions that integrate AI technologies such as deep leaning, natural language processing, robotics and big data analytics into new  applications.  The p rogram stresses both 
intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship and encourages students to de velop ideas for startups 
and for introduction into established companies.  
The curriculum is designed for students who have a strong background in computer science with interest in in-depth study of AI to enable them to develop real- world applications, 
espe cially in areas to which AI has not yet been applied . The integrated curriculum includes 
coursework  and team projects leading to a full -semester capstone project to produce a working 
prototype.

1.4 Carnegie Mellon Universit y Statement of Assurance  
Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, natio nal origin, sex, handicap or 
disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status or genetic information. Furthermore , Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is 
required not to discriminate i n violation of federal, state or local laws or executive orders.  8 
  
Inquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be directed 
to the u niversity ombudsman, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 
15213, telephone 412- 268-1018.  Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by 
calling 412 -268-2000.  
Carnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report 
describing the university's security, alcohol and drug,  sexual assault and fire safety policies, and 
containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on the campus, and the 
number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by con tacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412 -268-2323. The 
annual security and fire safety report also is available online at www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports.  
Information regarding the application of Title IX, including to admission and employmen t 
decisions, the sexual misconduct grievance procedures and process, including how to file a 
report or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment, and how the university responds to such reports is available at www.cmu.edu/ti tle-ix. The Title IX 
coordinator may be reached at 5000 Forbes Ave., 140 Cyert Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; 412 -268-
7125; or tix@cmu.edu.  
1.5 The Carnegie Mellon Code 
Stude nts at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to 
the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of  personal, ethical 
and moral conduct possible.  
These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as 
well as truth without equivocation and a wi llingness to place the good of the community above 
the good  of the self. Obligations once undertaken  must be met, commitments kept.  
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the 
standards of the community  in addition t o holding others accountable for said standards. It is 
rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect 
the community as a whole or that th e above standards do not apply.  
The discovery, advancement , and communication of knowledge are not possible without a 
commitme nt to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the 
creativity of others. New knowle dge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge . 
Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic commun ity 
cannot exist.  9 
 The commitment of its faculty, staff , and students to these standards contributes to the high 
respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that r espect  by 
their failure to meet these standards. Students w ho cannot meet  them should voluntarily 
withdraw from the university.  
The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be fou nd on- line at  https://www.c mu.edu/student-
affairs/theword /. 
1.6 The Reasonable Person Principle (RPP)  
It is a long -standing and revered principle of the School of Computer Science (SCS) that 
members of our community are expected to act reasonably, and therefore we try to keep formal, 
written SCS policies to a minimum.  The faculty do not burden the student s with numerous 
rules, and, in return, we expect the students to not try to find technical loopholes that violate 
the clear intent of program policies.  In any situation not covered by  an explicit rule, you should 
ask yourself how reasonable people would behave in that situation.  The RPP does not alter University -wide policies.  
2 The Language Technolo gies Institute  
2.1 Working  Space for MS Students  
Except for res trictions due to COVID, f ull-time  students in the LTI’s MS degree programs on the 
Pittsburgh campus h ave access to a shared working  space to create a sense of community and 
provide space for workin g when on campus.   In-person meetings, outside of a class being 
conducted in a classroom, are banned during COVID until further notice.  
2.2 Photocopies  and Printers  
Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental resources are located in GHC 5404  
The use of a photocopier  requires only a CMU ID card.  The School of Computer Science 
provides a number of  black -and-white and color printers for use by students.  The SCS 
Computer Facilities publishes a list of printers online at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/ .  
When you send a file to the print queue, you may go to any of the listed printers, swipe your 
CMU ID, and the file will be printed on that printer.  
2.3 Computers for MS Students  10 
 Students are expected  to provide their own  laptop computers that can be used to access 
university resources and complete course assignments.  Laptops running Windows, MacOS, and 
Linux software are all acceptable.  
MS students will be given  a CS user id.  A CS user id is  require d to use the LTI computer cluster, 
department printers, and other SCS services.  The Sch ool of Computer Science has a Help 
Center located at 4203 GHC.  They can be contacted  at help@cs.cmu.edu , extension 8 -4231 from 
a campus phone, or 412 -268-4231 from an outside line.  
MS students will be given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as- needed basis, to be used  
for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or  the capstone project.  The LTI cluster 
provides storage and computation for proje cts involving large datasets and/or  lengthy 
computation .  
3 Degree Requirements  
3.1 Course  Grade  and GPA Requirements    
To receive the M.S. degree, all students must take and successfully complete  at least 195  units 
of coursework . All required Core Courses must be compl eted with a grade of B or better. For 
the Knowledge Area Courses, students  must maintain  a B average. No grade lower than C shall 
be used  for cred it applied toward graduation.  No undergraduate courses count toward the 192 -
unit requirement.  
All Core course s are organized in sequence, and must be taken  in the following order: 
• Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets  (11-651) – No prerequisite required.  
• AI Engineering (11-695) – Prerequisite is the completion  of 11-651 with a grade of “B” or 
better.  
• LTI Pra cticum (11 -935) – Three credit units for completing the required Internship.  
• AI Innovati on (11-654) – Prerequisite is the completion of 11 -695 with a grade of “B” or 
better.  
• Capstone (11-699) – Prerequi site is the completion of 11- 654 with a grade of “B” o r better.  
Students are required to repeat any required course  that they have completed with a grade less 
than the required minimum, preferably at the next offering. (Please note that Core courses and 
Knowledge courses are only offered once per year.) Stud ents will be allowed to retake a required 
course only once . If a student fails in the se cond attempt, he or she will be dropped  from the 
MSAII program.    
If a student fails an elective course , she or he will need to repeat the same or take a substitute 
course (equivalent course approved  by the Director ).    11 
 All grades count towards the progr am Q PA, except for repeated courses, in which case the final 
grade replaces the previous grade .  Courses taken pass/no pass do not affect the student’s QPA.  
However, O NLY ELECTIVE COURSES MAY BE TAKEN PASS/NO PASS, unless the Provost 
directs to the contrary.  Students who do not achieve the required minimum grade  in a required 
course, who elect to take an “incomplete ” in a required course , or whose cumulative grade poin t 
average is below a B (3.0), will be placed on academic probation. Students on probation ar e not 
eligible to graduate. Students who are placed  on academic probation shall receive written  a 
notice  of this finding, including a list of measures that need to be taken to be removed  from 
academic probation. A student on academic probation for two consecutive semesters may be 
dropped  from the program.    
The MS AII program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each semester in 
order to monitor individual student pro gress toward graduation. Should a student’s effort fall 
below the acceptable academic performance and/or fail to mee t the standard s established by the 
MSAII program and Carnegie Mellon University, the student may be dismissed from the  
program.  
Should a stu dent’s overall QPA drop below 3.0 during any given semester, he/she will be placed 
on departmental probation for the following semester and will be required to improve his/her 
grades to no less than overall 3.0 QPA during that period. Failure to improve  to an overall 3.0 
QPA or better the following semester may result in  termination from the program. In addition, a 
student who  violate s policies established by Carnegie Mellon University may be dismissed from 
the program. 
After each acad emic progress review, a student may receive one or more letters, indicating the 
result o f the review. Warning letters are issued for the following cases:  
1) Overall QPA below 3.0 ( Academic probation)  
2) Semester QPA is below 3.0 
3) Grade below B in a Core course  
4) Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) according to the university policies.   This includes an y 
AIV letter received in 15- 513 during the summer preceding matriculation.  
A student may be terminated  from the program under  any of the following circumstance s: 
a) A stud ent who  has received two Academic In tegrity Violation (AIV) letters  will  be 
terminated.  There are no exceptions  and the Program Director has no discretion over 
such a termination  as it is an LTI policy . 
b) A student who has received one Academic In tegrity Vi olation  (AIV) letter may be 
terminated by the Program Director if the violation is so se rious that the student cannot 
be allowed to remain in the MSAII Program.  
c) A student has received three warning le tters of any type from the M SAII  program.  12 
 d) A student has been found to have violated  a University  Policy  for which termination is 
provided . 
An AI V letter or violation of University Policy may be appealed pursuant to CMU appeal 
procedures.  See Section 4.5.2, below.  However, a decision to terminate a student after appeal 
because of conditions a), b) , c) or d) is not appealable.  
3.2 Course Requirements   
1) Summer Before Entrance  
Admitted students are required to take, pay for, and pass the 15 -513 Introduction to 
Computer Systems course during the summer prior to their a rrival at Carnegie Mellon,  
but the summer class is only 6 units and will not be counted toward graduation units. 
15-513 may be taken pass/fail, but it cannot be dropped.  A student who drops 15 -513 
during the summer will not be permitted to begin the degre e program in the fall, but 
must retake 15- 513 the following summer.   The MSAII course of ferings are available at 
msaii.cs.cmu.edu/curriculum .  The university’s complete Schedule of Classes can be 
found  at https://enr- apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/search . 
Students are then required to take and successfully complete  the courses below:

In the event that a course is not available, a course  covering equivalent material w ith a 
similar degree of difficulty may be substituted  with the permission of the Directo r. If a 
student has already taken an equivalent course and shows proficiency in the subject 
area, a more advanced course  in the area may be taken  in place of these requ ired 
courses with permission of the Director . Graduate students cannot receive credit fo r 
undergraduate courses.       
 
4) Electives:  
A minimum of 36 units of SCS  courses must be taken.  It is recommended to take one 
elective in the first fall semester, one or two in the first spring semester, one or two in the second fall semester and zero or one in the second spring semester.  The courses 
below are approved.  A student who wants to take a course not listed must obtain 
approval of the Director prior to regis tering.  In general, the Director will approve any 
graduate SCS course of not more than 12 units.  It is also possible to seek approval for

 Students may take athletics or music or theatrical performance courses that do not 
require work outside of class times.  However, such courses will NOT count toward 
the 195 units required for gradua tion.  
3.3 Advising    
3.3.1 Student Advising  
Every MSAII student will be assigned an advisor , normally the Program Director.  Before the 
course registration per iod each semester, students must meet with their advisor to discuss their 
course selection. New students will be given instructions to register for their classes during the 
MSAII orientation.    
3.3.2 Monitoring Progress  
The advisor meets with the student at le ast twice a year, providing guidance and monitoring the 
student’s overall progress.   
3.3.3 Degree Certification   
Students who graduate having met all the requires for the degree will receive a diploma stating that the y have received  as “Master of Science in Art ificial Intelligence and Innovation. ” 
3.4 Internship    
Students must obtain an  internship  during the summer between  the first and second years of the 
program.  This is a requirement .  An internship will provide students with the opportunity to 
apply the knowle dge and technical skills learned during the first y ear of the program, to gain 
insight into AI and future market needs to further their experience and develop a strong  context 
for the second -year concentration coursework.  Normally the internship will be with an outside 
company.  In some circumstances, a student who is doing research with a CMU faculty member 
during the summer may request that such research qualify as an internship. 15 
 Students are encouraged to intern with an organization that corresponds to their  individual  area 
of interest and ca reer goals .   
All students who secure summer internships must register for three  units in 11 -935 (LTI 
Practicum).  Th is course  can be taken once during the program with Pass/Fail and will be 
counted  toward graduation  units.  International students must apply for Curricular Practical 
Training (CPT) for the internship by contact ing the Office of International Education (OIE).  To 
obtain CPT , students need an  offer letter spelling out employment dates, work hours, and  wages 
or stipend.   It is the student’s responsibility under 11 -935 to give a presen tation  durin g the 
semester following the internship to all current MSAI students d etailing the student’ s 
inter nship exper ience.  
International students  who are interested in wo rking in the U.S after graduation  should apply 
for the Optional Practical Training (OPT).  The office of International Education  (OIE) oversees 
the OPT registration.  Note: OPT must only be used  after students have completed the ir degree 
at Carne gie Mellon . 
NOTE : Students are personally responsible for securing a suitable internship.  The Career and 
Professional Development Center will assist  in their search for counseling, workshops, and 
internship opportunity listings in CareerNav igator.  We strongly  sugg est students begin the 
internship search beginning  in the Fall of your first year. Some internship opportunities have 
application deadlines in the Fall, so by starting your search early, you won't miss out on these 
internships.  The Career and Professional  Development Center will assist students with the 
internship search, but does not match students with employers; obtaining an internship is 
students’ responsibility.   
The following steps are recommended to ensure a successful inte rnship outcome.   Many of the 
events below will be conducted remotely during COVID.  
September/October  
• Meet with your advisor to discuss your interests and  plan your internship search.  
• Review the internships of previous students. We also encourage you to speak informally 
with second -year  students who can offer first- hand information about their internships.  
• Attend the Technical Opportunit ies Conference (TOC) at Carnegie Mellon for exposure 
to potential employers for internships.   
November/December  
• Begin researching organizations and internship opportunities. Pay close attention to 
organizations that have established internship programs and their deadlines.  
• Attend workshops to perfect your resume, hone your interviewing skills, and gain 
knowledge about the internship search proce ss.  
January/February  16 
 • At this point , you should have a “short list” of organizations at which you would like to 
intern. This list c an include organizations that have established internship programs as 
well as those that interest y ou without formal interns hip programs.  
• Update your resume with relevant academic projects, coursework, etc.  
• Begin utilizing your network for internship leads  as well as checking organization’s 
websites for internships.  
• Make contact with employers, sending  resumes and applications, and initiating internship 
interviews in person or by phone.  
• Attend Network Nights and talk to alumni about internship opportunities in their 
organization. They are an excellent resource for learning more about a particular organ ization , career field or employment opportunity. You can find alumni in the Alumni 
Directory, Alumni Career Advisor Network, and Carnegie Mellon Alumni Linke dIn 
Network.  
March/April  
• At this point , you should have secured an internship or be interviewing with various 
organization s.  
• Prepare a backup plan if your first choice s of internships do not work out.  
• Attend relevant Network Ni ghts and Career Fairs at Carne gie Mellon .  
• If you are an F -1 Visa stu dent, you must apply for CPT.  
• MSAII stude nts should enroll in 11-935 for three  units. You will not have to pay tuition for 
this course.    
3.5 Employment Eligibility Verification   
If you are receiving compensation from CMU, if you are going to be a TA or you  are planning to 
seek  a position with CMU , then Employment Eli gibility Verification  is required.  
Form I -9 must  be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of 
compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below.  
To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon Un iversity maintains th e Employment 
Eligibility Verification (I -9) Policy [pdf]  covering the university’s I -9 and E -Verify requirements:  
Every individua l receiving a stipend  from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I -9 
Policy by completing the Form I -9 within three business days following the first day of stipend 
start date/employment.  
Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsib le for 
submitting an E -Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources.   17 
 For more information, please see CMU’s Guidance for Completing t he Form I -9 and E -Verify 
Requirements at CMU [pdf] , or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about 
Form I -9 and E -Verify  and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I -9. 
3.6 MSAII Orientation  
Each  Fall semester , the MSAII program pr ovides a program orientation to help new students 
learn about the program . All new s tudents are required to attend them and trea t them seriously 
because they explain the  program sequence, its Core and Knowledge courses requirements and 
how students will meet the program learning outcomes.  
3.7 End of Semester Evaluation  
The MS AII program cond ucts an academic progre ss review at the conclusion of each semester in 
order to monitor individual student progress towards graduation. Should a student’s effort fall 
below the acceptable level of academic performance and/or fail to meet the standards established by the MS AII program, the student may be dismissed from the program.  
After each academic progress review, a student may receive one or more letters, indicating the result of the review. See Section 3.1, Course Grade and GPA Requirements, above.  
At the end of the semester , the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. If a student 
seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can 
finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of 
letter should be co nsidered a serious warning. It is not a permanent "black mark" on the 
student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official 
record of the letter in the student's transcript. 
In the most seriou s cases, the faculty gives the student a letter  that specifies a list of conditions 
that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the specified conditions 
may result in the student's termination from the program. 
3.8 Enrollment Ve rification  
Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, 
official transcript , and enrollment verification.  Enrollment verification can be requested online 
through The HUB at  www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student- records/transcripts/ .  18 
 3.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading  
3.9.1 University Policy on Grades  
www.cmu.edu/poli cies/student -and-student -life/grading.html  
 
This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals , 
and course repeats.   It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.  
3.9.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses & PCHE  
www.cmu.edu/policie s/student -and-student -life/transfer- credit -evaluation -and-
assignment.html   
Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross- registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Ed ucation (PCHE) and Cr oss-
registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. 
The Carnegie Mellon University  transcript will include in formation on such courses as follows: 
Carnegie Mellon courses and courses a re taken  through the university's cross- registration 
program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored  into the QPA. All other 
courses will be recorded  on this transcript indicating where the course was taken  but without a 
grade . Such cou rses will not be take n into account for academic actions, honors or QPA 
calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive 
transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this.)  
3.10 Academic I ntegrity  
Carnegie Mel lon’s Academic Integrity policy is posted  at 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student -life/academic- integrity.html.  All students  
are expected to be familiar with this policy , including the  university -wide protocol for handling 
academic integrity violations.   The policy includes the University expectations around academic 
integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.  
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures 
(https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/academic- discipline/index.html ) is also 
recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and 
adjudicating viol ations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also 
outline the appeal process.  
It is an absolute requirement  that the work you submit must be your own , unless you 
specifically identify the source of any material  that is not yours.  This includes quotations and 
material from websites.  In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any 19 
 person other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that work.  Any  student who violates 
the academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in 
suspension or expulsion under University policies.   THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE  
FACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE 
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY.   
You are not per mitted to copy materi al from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them 
as your own work.  Any copied material MUST appear in quotation marks or italics and MUST 
be accompanied by a citation to the original source.  Failure to do this violates CMU’s Policy on Academic In tegrity, which states, “In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources 
is required. … Plagiarism is defin ed as the use of work or concepts contributed by other 
individuals without proper attribution or citation. Unique ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be graded.”  
It is a violation of academic integrity for you to assist anyone else in violating the policy or to 
provide your work to others to assist them.  Because team deliverables are the product of joint 
work, it is the responsibility of each member of a team to ensure t hat all team materials have 
been produced in conformance with CMU policies. Credit cannot be given for work that is not a 
student’s own . Therefore, if one member of a team violates a policy, for example, by copying 
material from the Internet without indica ting its source, then no one on the team can receive 
credit for that work, even if only one student is directly guilty of violating the  policy.  
We are aware that acts that constitute cheating can be viewed very differently in different 
countries and cultur es.  However, C arnegie Mellon is a U.S. university and its policies reflect 
U.S. culture.  Employers expect that s tudents who graduate from C arnegie Mellon  have 
obtained their degree legitimately and according to Carnegie Mellon policies.  If you have any 
doubt whether proposed conduct would be considered cheating under C arnegie Mellon policies, 
ASK A FACULTY MEMBER OR THE DIRECTOR FIRST.    
All violations of the Academic Integrity policy MUST be reported to the University 
administration by the faculty membe rs involved.  Copies go to the Program Director, the Head of 
the Language Technology Institute , the Associate Dean  for Master’s Programs, and various 
officials at Warner Hall.   The faculty do not have the option to decline to make a report.  The 
offending  student will receive an email to inform them of an Academic Integrity Violation (AIV). 
The email will specify the  offense and the pena lty, and will inform the student of available 
appeal procedures. An AIV that is successfully appealed is erased.  
Important note:   The university policy gives a department the option of “conven[ing] a 
disciplinary hearing according to t he procedures of the department/program.”   The LTI has a 
“two strikes” rule.  The LTI may terminate a student for a first violation, depending upon  the 
circumstances and severity of the violation .  The LTI always  terminates  a student for a second 
violation, with no exceptions.  20 
 4 Academic Policies  
4.1 Course  Registration     
4.1.1 Status  
All Students must be registere d for at least 48 units during each semester. Any questions about 
registration should be directed  to the Enrollment Services (the HUB). Note that Internatio nal 
students are required to be registered as full- time students, minimum 36 units .   
4.1.2 Academic Calendar  
The Academic Calendar can be found at www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar.html .   All dates about  
registratio n, add/drop deadlines , university holidays and more can be found  there.    
4.1.3 Online Regi stration  
All new students will already be registered for required courses and will be able to register for 
electives  during the MS AII orientation session. After that, st udents will register  following the 
schedule set by the HUB. Note that students must me et with their advisor to obtain approval for 
their course selection. Registration information is available at 
www.cmu.e du/hub/registrar/registration/index.html .  Online registration is done  with an 
Andrew ID at www.cmu.edu/hub/sio .   
Students must register for at least 48 units per semester.   
4.1.4 Pass/ No Pass  Courses (Pass/Fail)  
Wit h the approval  of the Program Director, a graduate student may  choose  to take an 
ELECTIVE  course pass/ no pass. Core courses and Knowledge courses may not be taken pass/no 
pass.  By the deadline for changing a course to pass/no pass, the student must fill o ut the 
Pass/ No Pass Approval Form and receive permission from the course’s instructor. Classes taken 
pass/no pass  cannot be used to fulfill graduation requirements, and pass/no pass status is 
irrevocable. ( A form can be found  at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html ) 
4.1.5 Auditing a Course  
With  the approval  of the  Program Director, a graduate student may audit  a course by obtaining  
the permission  of the instructor or teaching department and co mpleting the Course A udit 
Approval Form.  Audited classes are not taken for credit and cannot be used to fulfill graduation 
requirements. (Audit form can be found  at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html )  21 
 4.1.6 Add ing a Course  
During the ADD period of each semester (the first two weeks of the semester), students may add 
a course by registering online. After the ADD deadline, they may add a course  by completing the 
Late Add Request form and obtaining  the permission  of both: 1) the instr uctor or teaching 
department and 2) their advisor. (Add form can be found  at www.cmu.edu/hub/forms)   
4.1.7 Dropping a Course  
Dropping courses is not recommended except for reasons of health or family emergency.  Many 
SCS courses have long waitlists, and  dropping a course means that some other student who 
might have had the opportunity to take the course had been denied that ability.  Also, if students in the MSAII program drop courses, then the instructors of those courses may no longer all ow 
MSAIIs to e nroll.  
Sometimes, however, a student’s workload can become unexpectedly heavy because of course requirements.  No one is expected to suffer from such pressure and dropping a course may become a necessity.  To avoid this unfortunate circumstan ce, you should  inform yourself in 
advance of the curriculum and workload in each course you plan to take and ensure that you are capable of handling the load.  Note that CMU SCS courses are very difficult, and students who 
may easily have handled taking five courses simultaneo usly at another institution may not be 
able to do so at CMU.  
Exact add, drop and withdrawal dates may be found on the  official Academic Calendar. Up until 
the deadlines, students can initiat e course adds and drops through Student Information Online 
(SIO). Courses dropped by the dead line will not appear on the student's record, and courses 
withdrawn from by the deadline will receive a 'W' grade. Additiona lly, a voucher process has 
been impleme nted for late drops.  
Students taking undergra duate and Master’s le vel courses must follow the procedures  and 
deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the  academic 
calendar. Information can be found at 
https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registra r/course -
changes/index.html . 
Late Course Drops & Vouchers 
A late drop voucher system was implemented beginning with the fall 2018  semester to permit a 
limited number of late course drops. Master's students are p ermitted one  drop vou cher per year 
of study and may use only one voucher per semester ( including summer).  Courses dropped 
using a voucher will be removed from the student's record, as long as the drop is confirmed in 
SIO by the student within 24 hours of receiv ing th e automat ed voucher email (refer to 
instructions below). Students may  use drop vouchers up until the last day of classes each 22 
 semester.   These policies are spelled out at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course -
changes/index.html . 
Note that th e Core cours es and some Knowledge courses are only offered once per year so 
dropping a course  may delay program completion.  
Note:  International students must maintain a minimum of 36 units (Full time) to meet the U.S. 
government’s visa requirement. Please  check with the Offic e of International Education (OIE) 
for more information.   
4.1.8 Transfer Credits   
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student -life/transfer- credit -evaluation -and- 
assignment.html  
Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a 
cross- registratio n program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-
registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. 
The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross- registration program 
will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the cour se was taken, but without grades. Such 
courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only 
if their college's and department's policies allow this.) . 
The MSAII program does not accept tran sfer credits . 
4.1.9 Leave of Absence  
Studen ts who need to delay their  studies for personal, medical or academic reasons may do so 
with a leave of absence (leaving the university temporarily with a commitment to return). 
Students must contact the MSAII Director to discuss their plans and fill out the appropriate 
form.  The s tudent’s place in the program will be held  until a mutually determined time. For 
more information refer to www.cmu.edu/policies/student -and-student -life/student- leave.html . 
When planning to return from Leave of Absence students must complete the appropriate paperwork before returning to the University.   
4.1.10  Withdrawal   
Students who need to withdraw from the program (leave the university with no in tention of 
returning) for personal, medical or academic reasons must contact the MS AII Director to 23 
 discuss their plans and fill out the appropriate form. For more information refer to 
www.cmu.ed u/policies/student -and-student -life/student- leave.html .    
4.2 Tuition and Fees    
Information about tuition and fees is available at www.cmu.edu/hub/tuition/index.  MSAII 
students will pay tuition  according to the rates set for the Sc hool of Computer Science.  All 
tuition and fees must be paid  in full by the due date; a student not in good financial standing will 
be dismissed  from the program. Students taking summer courses must pay tuition.   
4.3 Graduation  Ceremonies    
The Universi ty holds one Commencement ceremony in May of each year.   Only students who 
have completed their degree requirements may participate in Commencement.  
There are no August or December commencement ceremonies.   
4.4 LTI Academic Poli cies 
4.4.1 “Grandfather” policy  
A stud ent can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the 
program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted 
after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy  exactly , 
the depa rtment may approximate the policy  as closely as possible; this situation is rare and 
typically arises only when a student is enrolled  in the program for an extended period . 
4.4.2  Definition of transfer credit  versus course exem ption  
The LTI may grant transfer credit  or issue an exemption  for equivalent graduate courses 
previously completed  at another institution. This decision rests with the program director, on 
the advice of the faculty member for whose course an exemption is sought.  If a student is 
exempt  from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that 
course  with an open elective. The student does not receive  credit for the ex empted  course  but 
can take any course  that could normally  coun t towa rd the degree in its place. If a student 
receives  credit  for prior coursework completed at C arnegie Mellon  or elsewhere, the student 
receives  that many units of credit and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by 
that amount . 24 
 4.4.3 Employ ment/ Consul ting  
Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally  permitted to consult at most 
one day per seven- day week, with the Program Director's consent.  International students must 
also have approval in advance from the Office of Inter nation al Education (OIE)  for any paid 
position.  Students may use their consulting time to perform unpaid work on research projects 
for CMU faculty . 
4.4.4  Leave of Absence  
The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence ( LOA)  since students usually do not return, des pite 
good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most one  year, 
upon written request to the MSAII Director and with  the consent  of the student's advisor. It is 
the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to in itiate  a return to the program. 
Students taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university’s leave  of 
absence process, which is described  at www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student-
life/student- leave.html.  
4.4.5 Satisfactory Progress  
If a s tudent  does not make satisfactory  progress each semester toward completing the degree, the 
LTI may remove the student from the program.  See section on “End of Semester Evaluation .” 
4.5 Carnegie Mellon  Academic Policies  
4.5.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabili ties 
The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to 
provide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the Carnegie Mellon community.   We work to ensure that qualified individua ls re ceive reasonable 
accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.   Students who would like to receive accommodations 
must submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form to access@andrew.cmu.edu
 to begin the 
interactive accommodation process.    
For more information , please see www.cmu.edu/hr/eos/disability .  Students with physical, 
sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self -identify with the Office of 
Disability Resources and request needed accommodations.  Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268 -6121 . 25 
 4.5.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures  
Students who believe that they have been inappropriately treated are encouraged to raise  their 
concern (s) with the Program Director, department head, or other designated person in their 
department, college, or central administration according to University policies.  No effort will be 
made to prevent or discourage anyone from availing themsel ves of such pr ocedures (see 
Graduate Student Appeal and Procedures www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal -grievance -
procedures.html ). 
Graduate students will find the Summar y of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance 
Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource web  page .   This document summarizes 
processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non -academic issues. 
Graduate  students are expected to seek informal re solution of all concerns within the applicable  
department, unit or program before i nvoking formal processes. When an informal  resolution  
cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to 
follow the fo rmal  procedure s outlined here.   These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply 
to students in  all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department 
specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program.  Additionally, students may confer  with 
the Graduate Education Office ( graded@andrew.cmu.edu
) on issues of process or other 
concerns as they navigat e conflicts.  
4.5.3 Proces s for Appealing Final Grades  
https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal -grievance -procedures. html .  
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of 
the instructor and the de partment, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of 
the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade.  The following ci rcumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a 
grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error 
such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), 
or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the g rade did so in violation of a University 
policy  
4.5.4 Safeguarding Educational Equity:  
Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault  
The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassmen t, sexual assault, dating/ 
domestic violence and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals 
who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith.  The University’s Sexual 
Misconduct Policy is available at  www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative -and-26 
 governance/sexual -harassment -and-sexual- assault.html .   If you believe you have been the victim 
of sex ual harassme nt or sexual assault, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the 
following resources:  
• Office of Title IX Initiatives, http://www.cmu.edu/title -ix/, 412 -268-7125  
• Sexual Harassment Advisors, found in Appen dix A of the Policy Against Sexual 
Harassment and Sexual Assault;  
• Survivor Support Network, found  in Appendix  B of the Policy Against Sexual 
Harassment and Sexual Assault;  
• Sexual Harassment Process and Title IX Coordinators, found  in section II  of the Poli cy 
Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault;  
• University Police, 412 -268-2323  
• University Health Services, 412 -268-2157  
• Counseling & Psychological Services, 412 -268-2922 
Additional resources and information can be found at:  https://www.cmu.edu/title -ix/resources-
and-infor mation/resources.html . 
The MSAII program has a ZER O TOLERANCE policy on sexual harassment and sexual assault. 
If you are found to have violated Carnegi e Mellon policy, you will be dropped from the MSAII  
program immediately without exception .  CMU has spent decades successfully developing a 
non-threatening environment for all genders and no one will be permitted to interfere with that 
accomplishment.  
Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate Students  
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student -life/consensual -relationships.html  
This policy is relevant for graduate students who will be in a supervisory role of undergraduate 
students as a TA or in a research lab/studio setting .  This  policy addresses the circumstances in 
which romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/interactions wit h undergraduate students, 
even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure 
healthy professional relationships. T his policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate 
relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has 
authority over the other as in the po licy.  
4.5.5 Cultural Tolerance 
The MS AII program is extremely diverse f or a program of its size. We have students from 
numerous different countries who must work effectively in a team setting.  The students 27 
 invariably come from very different cultures that have differing attitudes towards age, gender, 
and group interaction.  The program management understands this, but the students must also 
recognize that this program is being conducted in the United States and operates according to 
U.S. norms.  Students and faculty, regardless of background, age, or rank, must deal with each 
other respectfully without insult or raised voices.  It is impossible to conduct teamwork in any 
other way.  Violations will be dealt with harshly.  The Program Director is not sympathetic to 
such behavior, which will not be  tolerated.  Repeated infractions, or a serious single infraction 
may result in termination from the p rogram . 
4.5.6 Language Policy  
The MSAII program is a component of the Language Technologies Institute, which studies and 
celebrates the diversity of human language and forms of expression .  The LTI also recognizes the 
futility and unfairness of attempting to determine the language students  must use when 
communicating.  However, it is unprofessional in any official team meeting to speak a language 
that is not unde rstood by all team members.  For example, if all members of a team understand 
Chinese, then they may use Chinese in team meetings.   However, if even one team member does 
not understand Chinese, then a language must be used that is understood by all team me mbers.   
It is recommended that non -native speakers of English use English as much as possible if they 
intend to seek employment in  an English -speaking country.  
4.5.7 Maternity Accommodation Protocol  
Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of  the semester may consider 
taking time away from their coursework and  research responsibilities. All female students  who 
give bir th to a child while engaged in coursework or research are eligible to take either a short -

4.6 Statute of L imitations  
www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student -life/masters- students -statute -of-limitations.html . 28 
 Students must  complete all requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven 
years from original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more restrictive 
department, school or college policy.  Once this time -to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may 
resume work towards a master’s deg ree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master’s 
degree program under criteria determined by that program.  
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability,  a school or college may, upon the relevant department's 
recommendation and with the written approv al of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a 
period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a 
master’s degree as part -time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their 
program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the  time to degree 
limit .  
Any request for a waiver of the  statute  of limitations must be approved by th e Department Head 
and by the SCS Associate Dean for Masters Programs. The waiver request must explain the exceptional circumstances that warrant an extension. For cases in which a waiver is granted , 
the waiver  will cover specific courses and will specify a time period  for completion of the 
program.

7.2.2 Student Academic Success Center  
https://www.cmu.edu/student- success/  
Student Academic Support Programs 
Tartan Scholars  
• The Tartan Scholars program was created to provide support for limited resourced 
students through an intentional first year undergraduate experience with the goals of 
enhancing the cohort’s skill and community building through a lens of self - authorship, 
growth mindset, and a sense of belonging. As part of the Student Academic Success 
Center, Tartan Scholars are invited to join the University and participate in summer 
initiatives and pre -orientation activities prior to their first year at the University.  
 
• There are opportunities for graduate students to serve as accountability, learning, or development partners, workshop facilitators, and presenters. Contact Diane Hightower 
at ddhighto@andrew.cmu.edu
 for more d etails.  
 
Learning Support  
• Supplemental Instruction:  Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an academic support model 
that utilizes peer -assisted study sessions. The SI program provides regularly scheduled 
revie w sessions on course materials outside the classroom. SI is a non -remedial approach 42 
 to learning as the program targets high- risk courses and is available in select courses 
based on data related to past student performance and feasibility.  
• Peer Tutoring:  Weekly Tutoring Appointments are offered in a one- on-one and small 
group format to students from any discipline who need assistance with a course that may 
not be supported by our other services. Weekly appointments give students the 
opportunity to interact regularly with the same tutor to facilitate deeper understanding 
of concepts. Students can register onl ine through the Student Academic Success website.   
• Academic Coaching: Academic Coaching provides holistic one -on-one peer support and 
group workshops to help students find and implement their conditions for success.  We 
assist students in improving time m anagement, productive habits, organization, stress 
management, and study skills.  Students will request support through the Academic 
Success Center website and attend in- person meetings or meet using video and audio 
conferencing technology to provide all students with support.  
• “Just in Time” Workshops:  The Student Academic Success team is available to partner 
with instructors and departments to identify s kills or concepts that would benefit from 
supplemental offerings (workshops, boot camps) to support stu dents’ academic success 
and learning.  We are eager to help convene and coordinate outside of the classroom skill -building opportunities that can be open  to any student interested in building skill 
or reinforcing course concept mastery.  
• Study Partners:  Support for students to create and benefit from their own study groups: 
The Student Academic Success team assists students in forming and benefiting from pe er 
study groups, whereby all students can reap the benefits of peer- to-peer learning, 
student agency, a nd collaboration skill development. Staff from the Student Academic 
Success Center will be made available to instructors and students to assist with the formation of peer -led study groups.  This level of support is open to any course where the 
instructor r equests or agrees such support is appropriate and students are interested in 
both leading and participating.   
 
Language and Cross -cultural Support  
More  than 60% of graduate students at Carnegie Mellon are international students, and others 
are nonnative speakers of English who have attended high school or undergraduate programs in 
the US. Many of these students  want to hone their language  and cross- cultural skills  for 
academic and professional success. Students can choose from sessions on   
• how to give a strong presentation,   
• writing academic emails,   
• expectations and strategies for clear academic writing,   
• how to talk about yourself as a professional in t he U.S.,  
• developing clearer pronunciation,   
• using accurate grammar,  
• building fluency, and mo re.  43 
 • Students can make an appointment with a Language Development Specialist  to get 
individualized coaching on language or cross- cultural issues.  
 
The Student Aca demic Success Center is also charged with certifying the language of 
International Teaching Assistants (ITAs), ensuring that nonnative  English speakers have the 
language proficiency needed to succeed as teaching  assistants in the Carnegie Mellon classroom.  
Students preparing to do an ITA Certification should plan to take cl asses offered by the 
language  support team at the SASC from the beginning of their first semester. Start by 
contacting the language support team at the SASC website or attend a Language S upport 
Orientation at the SASC or in your department.
