Shamos, Ph.D., J.D.\n\nDistinguished Career Professor, School of Computer Science\n\nRashid Auditorium, 4401 Gates & Hillman Centers\n\nShow More information\n\nBitcoin is a form of digital money not controlled by any country or organization. Transactions are managed and verified by open source software running on thousands computers worldwide. It is now sold (and sometimes accepted) in stores and even issued by vending machines. But Bitcoin exchanges have been hacked, resulting in millions of dollars in losses. For these reasons, Bitcoin has captured the imagination of futurists but raised concern among governments over its possible use in crime and terrorist financing and loss of control over money supplies. This talk explains in non-technical terms how Bitcoin works and what its risks and benefits are, and what it means to \u201cmine\u201d a Bitcoin. We will discuss the possible future of Bitcoin and its rivals.\n\nAdd to Calendar 09-10-2014 16:30:00 09-10-2014 17:30:00 15 What\u2019s a Bitcoin? \u2013 A Non-Technical Introduction - Michael I.
