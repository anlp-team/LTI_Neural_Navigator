You will have three attempts.\n\nNo incomplete applications will be eligible for consideration.\n\nFor specific application/admissions questions, please contact Brianna Eriksen .\n\nFor a complete breakdown of the MIIS program and its policies, including information about internships, please view the MIIS Handbook.\n\nFor more information on the MIIS program, please contact Brianna Eriksen .\n\nMaster of Computational Data Science (MCDS)\n\nOverview\n\nRequirements\n\nCurriculum\n\nAdmission\n\nHandbook\n\nAdditional Info\n\nThe MCDS degree focuses on engineering and deploying large-scale information systems. Our comprehensive curriculum equips you with the skills and knowledge to develop the layers of technology involved in the next generation of massive information system deployments and analyze the data these systems generate. When you graduate, you\u2019ll have a unified vision of these systems from your core courses; internship experience; and semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. MCDS graduates are sought-after software engineers, data scientists and project managers at leading information technology, software services and social media companies.\n\nThe MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.\n\nHere are the options:\n\nStandard Timing \u2014 a 16-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and fall semester of study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 48 units. This timing is typical for most students. Students graduate in December.\n\nExtended Timing \u2014 a 20-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of fall and spring study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 36 units. Students graduate in May.\n\nFor a complete overview of the MCDS requirements, visit the MCDS website or read the MCDS Handbook .\n\nTo earn an MCDS degree, student must pass courses in the core curriculum, the MCDS seminar, a concentration area and electives. Students must also complete a capstone project in which they work on a research project at CMU or on an industry-sponsored project.\n\nIn total, students must complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.\n\nMCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study.\n\nClick here to see the MCDS Course Map.\n\nSome example courses of study are included below.\n\nExample 1: Analytics Major, 16 Months\n\nExample 1: Analytics Major, 16 Months\n\nFall Spring Summer Year 1 Data Science Seminar Machine Learning Machine Learning for Text Mining Advanced Machine Learning Design and Engineering of Intelligent Information Systems Big Data Analytics Data Science Seminar Capstone Planning Seminar Machine Learning with Big Data Sets Cloud Computing Information Systems Project Search Engines Multimedia Databases and Data Mining Large Scale Multimedia Analysis Summer Internship Year 2 Data Science Analytics Capstone\n\nExample 2: Systems Major, 16 Months\n\nExample 2: Systems Major, 16 Months\n\nFall Spring Summer Year 1 Computational Data Science Seminar Advanced Storage Systems Cloud Computing Distributed Systems Machine Learning Computational Data Science Seminar Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming Advanced Databases Search Engines Summer Internship Year 2 Computational Data Science Systems Capstone Operating Systems or Web Applications\n\nExample 3: Human-Centered Data Science Major, 16 Months\n\nExample 3: Human-Centered Data Science Major, 16 Months\n\nExample Schedule Fall Spring Empirical Analysis of Interactive Systems ML Econometrics Social Web Network Science Business Analytics Interactive Data Science Psych Found for Design Impact Econometrics DHCS Social Web Analytics & Design ML ARM Social Web Network Science Crowd Programming Data Pipeline ML for Text Analytics DHCS Ubiquitous Computing DHCS ML ARM Interactive Data Science Rapid Prototyping Gadgets Usable Priv & Security Advanced ML Educational Software Design DHCS ML ARM Learning Analytics and EDS Learning with Peers Psych Found for Design Impact ML with Big Data ML with Text Analysis\n\nCarnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science has a centralized online application process .

Information retrieval, machine translation and speech technology are used daily by the general public, while text mining, natural language processing and language-based tutoring are common within more specialized professional or educational environments. The LTI prepares students for this world by offering a minor that gives you the opportunity to not only learn about language technologies, but to also apply that knowledge through a directed project.\n\nStudents interested in the language technologies minor must complete our prerequisite courses with an average grade of B (3.0) or better before applying to the program. (Students who do not meet this average must submit a letter of explanation along with their application.) Prerequisites include:\n\nPrinciples of Imperative Computation (15-122)\n\nPrinciples of Functional Programming (15-150)\n\nWe also strongly encourage candidates to take\n\nDifferential and Integral Calculus (21-120) and Integration and Approximation (21-122)\n\nMatrices and Linear Transformations (21-241) or Matrix Theory (21-242)\n\nProbability and Computing (15-259) or Probability (21-325) or Probability Theory for Computer Scientists (36-218) or Introduction to Probability Theory (36-225)\n\nThe Language Technologies Concentration requires that SCS students complete one core course and their choice of three elective courses of at least 9 units each. The electives can be chosen from a specific set of stand-alone courses. In addition to the four courses, students are required to do an undergraduate research project for at least 9 units to complete their concentration.\n\nCourse Requirements for Undergraduate Minor\n\nCore Course Electives (Choose Three) Project Human Language for Artificial Intelligence (11-411) Natural Language Processing (11-411) Machine Learning for Text and Graph-based Mining (11-441) Search Engines (11-442) Speech Processing (11-492) Machine Learning in Practice (11-344) Advanced Natural Language Processing (11-711) Machine Translation and Sequence-to-Sequence Models (11-731) Multilingual Natural Language Processing (11-737) Neural Networks for NLP (11-747) Speech Recognition and Understanding (11-751) Language and Statistics (11-761) Multimodal Affective Computing (11-776) The Nature of Language (80-180) Students must complete a semester-long directed research project in the context of being registered for an independent study or thesis. This should provide hands-on experience and an in-depth study of a topic in same area as a chosen elective.\n\nStudents interested in earning a minor in language technologies must apply for admission no later than September 30 of their senior year. An admission decision will usually be made within one month. Students may petition the LTI undergraduate program director to be admitted to the minor earlier or later in their undergraduate careers.
