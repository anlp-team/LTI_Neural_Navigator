Students shall reference CMU Policy on Master\u2019s Student Statute of Limitations (www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of limitations.html) regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time allowable for master\u2019s degree completion and certification.\n3.1.4 Additional Guidance for Students\nProgram of Study: Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.\nFinancial Aid and Student Account: Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 11\n\n\n\nfinancial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs. International Students: Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate- graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.\n4 MIIS Degree Attainment\n4.1 Program options\nThe MIIS degree is offered in two options:\nOption 1.

MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.\nMIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration:\nHuman Language for Language Technologies \u2022 Language Technology Application \u2022 Machine Learning for Language Technologies\nPart-time options are available in some cases.\n4.2 Course Requirements\nTo complete the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems, a student must satisfy three types of requirements. Curricular requirements ensure that MIIS students receive instruction in core intelligent information systems technologies while also allowing an opportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest. Practice requirements are opportunities to apply and hone new skills while building state-of-the-art systems. Grade requirements ensure that students have demonstrated a certain level of skill while completing degree requirements. All three types of requirements are described below.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 12\n\n\nMIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12-unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements and 66 practice units for a total of 150 units to attain the Standard MIIS degree.\nMIIS-21 students must take at least 108 units (typically 9 12-unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses and 66 practice units to satisfy their degree requirements, making it a total of 174 units to attain the MIIS: Advanced Study degree.\n4.2.1 Curricular Requirements\nA MIIS student must complete the following curricular requirements:\n1. Qualifying courses:\nMIIS-16 students must pass 72 units (typically 6 12-unit courses) and MIIS-21 students must complete 96 units (typically 8 12-unit courses) in qualifying master\u2019s courses.\nA qualifying master\u2019s course is defined as:\na. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies\nInstitute; and\nb. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) from the list of approved qualifying\ncourses (Section 3.2.4).\n2. Free elective: Students must pass 12 units (typically 1 course) in elective master\u2019s course(s). A free elective is defined as:\na. A graduate course (600-level or higher) with content relevant to the MIIS\nprogram objectives offered by the School of Computer Science; and\nb. A course approved by the student's advisor and the degree Program Director. c. A student may not use the same course to satisfy both a qualifying course\nrequirement and an elective course requirement.\n3. Breadth requirements: Students must demonstrate breadth by passing one course in each of the following areas. In addition, MIIS-21 students must take two more LTI courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas of concentration:\nHuman language; \u2022 Machine learning; and \u2022 Language technology applications.\nThe department maintains and publishes a list of courses that satisfy each of these requirements (Sections 3.2.5 \u2013 3.2.7). Some courses used to satisfy a breadth requirement can also satisfy qualifying course requirements.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 13\n\n\n4.2.2 Practice Requirements\nA student must complete at least 66 practice-oriented course units and satisfy the following practice-oriented requirements for both MIIS-16 and MIIS-21 programs.\n1. Directed study requirement: Students must pass 24 units (typically 12 units x 2 semesters) in directed study under the supervision of their advisor. Directed study is a structured, task-oriented form of independent study that provides deep, hands-on experience in a particular technology area and an opportunity to work closely with a member of the faculty.\n2. Internship requirement: Students must complete a one-semester (typically summer) internship at an organization (typically a company or government agency) approved by the MIIS Program Director. Internships are an opportunity to apply new skills in a professional setting and to learn about software development in a \u2018real world\u2019 organization. Students with prior professional experience may petition the MIIS Program Director to waive this requirement. MIIS students that do an internship during the summer semester are required to present their internship at a poster session at the beginning of the following Fall semester. The poster and the student\u2019s participation in the poster session are part of the internship requirement. Participation is required unless waived in writing by the MIIS Program Director.\n3. Capstone requirements: Students must complete a capstone project (36 units) and a capstone planning seminar (6 units). The capstone requirement gives students experience with collaborative, team-oriented software development; significant hands- on experience with the techniques studied in the classroom; and an opportunity to work on a large software application. a. The capstone project (36 units) is a large, group-oriented demonstration of student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically, the result of the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project is supervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly basis to monitor progress and provide guidance.\nb. The capstone planning seminar (6 units) organizes students into groups; defines capstone project goals, requirements, success metrics, and deliverables; and identifies and acquires data, software, and other resources required for successful completion of the project. The planning seminar must be completed in the semester prior to taking the capstone project.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 14\n\n\n4.2.3 Grade Requirements\nStudents must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed study and capstone projects by satisfying the following grade requirements:\n1. Minimum grade: A student must obtain a B- or better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student receives a C or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree requirements\n2. Minimum QPA: A student must maintain an average QPA of at least 3.0 in courses and projects used to satisfy degree requirements.\n3. Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses. 4.2.4 Process for Appealing Final Grades\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and-academic- actions.html\nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university policy.\n4.2.5 Approved Qualifying Courses\nAny graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is a qualifying course.\nAny two graduate courses (600-level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS relevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses.\nAny course from the following list is an approved qualifying course.\n02-712, Computational Methods for Biological Modeling and Simulation\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 15\n\n\n05-631, Software Structures for User interfaces \u2022 05-813, Human Factors \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 17-631 Information Security, Privacy & Policy 17-781, Mobile and IoT Computing Services 16-720, Computer Vision\n4.2.6 Breadth Courses: Human Language\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n11-611, Natural Language Processing 11-624, Human Language for Artificial Intelligence 11-711, Advanced NLP 11-722 Grammar Formalisms 11-724, Human Language for Artificial Intelligence 11-727, Computational Semantics for NLP 11-737, Multilingual NLP\n4.2.7 Breadth Courses: Language Technology Applications\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n11-642, Search Engines 11-688, Computational Forensics and AI 11-692, Speech Processing 11-751, Speech Recognition and Understanding 11-767, On-Service Machine Learning 11-797, Question Answering 11-830, Computational Ethics For NLP\n4.2.8 Breadth Courses: Machine Learning\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n11-641, Machine Learning for Text Mining 11-661, Language and Statistics 11-663, Applied Machine Learning 11-747, Neural Networks for NLP 11-755, Machine Learning for Signal Processing 11-761, Language and Statistics 11-777, Multimodal Machine Learning 11-785, Introduction to Deep Learning 10-601, Introduction to Machine Learning (Master\u2019s) 10-605, Machine Learning with Large Datasets 10-701, Introduction to Machine Learning (PhD) 10-707, Advanced Deep Learning\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 16\n\n\n\u2022 \u2022\n10-708, Probabilistic Graphical Models 10-714, Deep Learning Systems 10-715, Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning\n4.3 Internships\nIf the experience will have units attached to it, the program should have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. Students are responsible for identifying and applying for internships on their own. The LTI and the university provide several types of support for students seeking internships.\nAn annual poster session helps spread information from MIIS students that recently completed internships to MIIS students that will soon seek internships; other LTI professional master\u2019s programs have similar internship-oriented poster sessions that MIIS students may attend. The university offers resume-writing and interviewing workshops to help prepare students and fall and spring employment fairs to help students connect with companies. The university\u2019s Career & Professional Development Center https://www.cmu.edu/career/ provides other services as well.\nIf a student cannot find an internship, the MIIS program will arrange an on-campus internship with a university-based project. This internship may be unpaid.\nInternational students are required to consult with Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract (required addition to ensure the university is in compliance with immigration laws for F & J status students).\n4.4 Advising\nEach student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed study projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.\nHow and when the advisor is selected: Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. Typically, if a student and faculty member agree to enter an advising relationship, it is approved by the Program Director. If a student has not found an advisor after one month in the program, the Program Director will assign an advisor to the student.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 17\n\n\nHow to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem, assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here. It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time.\n4.5 LTI Orientation\nPrior to the beginning of each Fall semester the LTI provides lectures and faculty research talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and to treat them as seriously as a course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. Students do not have to register for the LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks, nor do they receive a grade, however the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.\nThe LTI Orientation Canvas course is a mandatory course designed to increase incoming LTI graduate students' awareness and understanding of CMU's community standards and the resources that CMU offers the students. The course includes several administrative tasks, training, and educational sessions. The students will be enrolled into the course by the program administrator in early August. All MIIS students are expected to complete all assignments by the end of their first semester in the program. Each assignment has its own due date.\n4.6 End of Semester Review\nNear the end of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes their achievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester. At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degree.\nA good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual.\nIf a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \"black mark\"\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 18\n\n\non the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.\nIn the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.\n4.7 Enrollment Verification\nEnrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript, and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student- records/verifications/enrollment.html.\n4.8 University Policies on Grades and Grading\n4.8.1 University Policy on Grades\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html\nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.\n4.8.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html\nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross- registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department's policies allow this.)\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 19\n\n\n4.8.3 Drop/Add/Withdraw procedures\nStudents taking undergraduate and master\u2019s level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course- changes/index.html. Please note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does not apply to Masters\u2019 students.\n4.9 Academic Integrity\nIn the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.\nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.\nIn any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.\nThe university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process.\nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.\nA review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 20\n\n\nadjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.\nImportant note: The LTI implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program\u201d. Our procedure is as follows: a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide to not immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation. If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.\n5 Academic Policies\n5.1 MIIS Academic Policies\n5.1.1 Double-Dipping\nA Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. (SCS policy)\n5.1.2 Duration of Study\nMIIS-16 students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in three semesters of academic study and one summer internship (16 months total).\nMIIS-21 students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in four semesters of academic study and one summer internship (21 months total).\nMIIS-16 students enrolled for part-time study are expected to complete the program in six semesters of academic study and one summer internship (27 months total).\nMIIS-21 students enrolled for part-time study are expected to complete the program in seven semesters of academic study and one summer internship (31 months total).\nSee also the \u2018Statute of Limitations\u2019 policy.\n5.1.3 Deferral\nMIIS students are given the opportunity to defer their enrollment. The deferral request must be approved by the program director. The deferral can only be used once for the period of one academic year.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 21\n\n\n5.1.4 Independent Studies\nAn independent study can be counted as an Elective course, but "}
