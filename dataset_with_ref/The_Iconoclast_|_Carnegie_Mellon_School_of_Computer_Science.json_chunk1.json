Berliner says it wouldbe a mistake to assume that a system based on the statistical analysis ofmassive data sets isn't a form of intelligence. \"Intelligence emerges just likelife emerges,\" he says. \"You take a bunch of inert chemicals which canreplicate themselves, and they form into a creature. It's the same thing withintelligence. We can talk about something being 'intelligent' when it meetssome certain criteria, but certainly even the dumbest living thing has somesort of intelligence, or it wouldn't stay alive.\" In that respect, Berlinersays, Kasparov certainly saw intelligence in Deep Blue--but machineintelligence, not human intelligence.\n\nBerliner also sees intelligence in Deep Blue's descendant, IBM's \"Jeopardy!\"-playing machine, Watson, which he calls \"quite marvelous.\" Just as notable as Watson's ability to answer \"Jeopardy!\" questions is its understanding of slang and idiom, Berliner says. \"I've worked in that area of general intelligence, and it's not easy,\" he says.\n\nBut Berliner being Berliner, he doesn't hesitate to point out where Watson had an unfair advantage over its human competitors. Watson received the Jeopardy! answers in written form and could immediately get to work, while the human players were still listening to and parsing the text. \"The computer was way, way ahead in understanding the question\u2014maybe a second or two ahead\u2014so 90 percent of the time, it rang in before the human,\" Berliner says. \"That gives it a tremendous advantage.

Botvinnik's fans attacked Berliner, but Schaeffer and others reviewed Berliner's evidence and concluded that Botvinnik indeed massaged his published results to achieve his outcomes. Berliner's 1999 book \"The System: A World Champion's Approach to Chess\" attracted sharp criticism from a few professional reviewers, but the sometimes very personal attacks left Berliner unbowed.\n\n\"A lot of people saw the significant value in what he did,\" says Campbell, who points out that in both the Botvinnik case and the strategy book, Berliner refused to take an easier path just to avoid unpleasantness. \"There's a lot to be said for that.
