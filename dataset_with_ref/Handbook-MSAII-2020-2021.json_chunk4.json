course concept mastery.\nStudy Partners: Support for students to create and benefit from their own study groups: The Student Academic Success team assists students in forming and benefiting from peer study groups, whereby all students can reap the benefits of peer-to-peer learning, student agency, and collaboration skill development. Staff from the Student Academic Success Center will be made available to instructors and students to assist with the formation of peer-led study groups. This level of support is open to any course where the instructor requests or agrees such support is appropriate and students are interested in both leading and participating.\nLanguage and Cross-cultural Support More than 60% of graduate students at Carnegie Mellon are international students, and others are nonnative speakers of English who have attended high school or undergraduate programs in the US. Many of these students want to hone their language and cross-cultural skills for academic and professional success. Students can choose from sessions on\nhow to give a strong presentation, \u2022 writing academic emails, \u2022 expectations and strategies for clear academic writing, \u2022 how to talk about yourself as a professional in the U.S., \u2022 developing clearer pronunciation, \u2022 using accurate grammar, \u2022 building fluency, and more. 42\n\n\nStudents can make an appointment with a Language Development Specialist to get individualized coaching on language or cross-cultural issues.\nThe Student Academic Success Center is also charged with certifying the language of International Teaching Assistants (ITAs), ensuring that nonnative English speakers have the language proficiency needed to succeed as teaching assistants in the Carnegie Mellon classroom.
