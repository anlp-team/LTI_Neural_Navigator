    "doc_text": " of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements.\nPolicy on Master\u2019s Student Statute of Limitations\nwww.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html\nSee the above link regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time allowable for master\u2019s degree completion and certification.\nAdditional Guidance for Students\nProgram of study. Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.\nFinancial aid and student account Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than- standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs.\nInternational students Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.\n12\n\n\n3.2 Full-time Status All MCDS students are expected to enroll full-time (at present, there is no option to pursue the degree as a part-time student). To be considered a full-time student, a student must be registered for, and complete, a minimum of 36 units in every Fall and Spring semester. All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status. Students can have no more than one (1) remote course counting toward the 36 units used to satisfy full-time enrollment. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, \u201cpermit of stay\u201d). All students having a Stafford Loan are required to maintain full-time status.\n3.3 MCDS Degree Enrollment Process and Related Information\n3.3.1 Duration of the degree program\nThe MCDS degree must be completed within five (5) years from the time that the student matriculates into the program.\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html\nAs outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations (see link above), students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program.\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.\n3.3.2 Residency requirements\nThere is no formal residence requirement. However, most courses in the program are taught on campus without an option for distance education. Students enrolled in in- person course sections (IPR) are expected to attend all class meetings in person.\n3.3.3 Degree Certification: Course requirements and related policies/protocols\n13\n\n\n\nIn order to receive the MCDS degree, students must have a Quality Point Average (QPA) of 3.0. Completion of the degree is based on completing courses in the core curriculum, the MCDS seminar, electives and capstone project.\nThe capstone project consists of students working at CMU on a research project, or on an industry-sponsored project.\nThe student must complete 144 eligible units of study. This includes eight core and concentration courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and two 12-unit capstone courses. All students complete a common MCDS core in their first two semesters, consisting of five courses. All students must also complete at least one concentration, consisting of three courses in one of three areas: Analytics, Systems, or Human-Centered Data Science. The remaining elective course can be any course with number 600 or above chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.\nTo maintain full-time enrollment status, a student must enroll in a minimum of 36 course units per semester. A student may not take more than 60 units per semester, without permission from their academic advisor. Students must maintain full-time enrollment status (minimum of 36 units) in their final semester.\n3.3.4 Prerequisite Core Course\nAll MCDS students are expected to pass the 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science course by the end of their first semester. Each student must pass 11-637 with a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better.\n3.3.5 Plan of study\nThe degree consists of two timing options based on the length of time the student spends working on the degree. The student chooses their timing at the start of the degree program (for visa requirements). Changes in timing are possible with the approval of the Director of the degree program and successful visa extension application with CMU\u2019s Office of International Education. Note that all degree options consist of the same amount of coursework:\nProfessional Preparation Track \u2013 a 16-month degree consisting of study for Fall and Spring semesters, a summer internship, and Fall semester of study. Each semester consists of a minimum of 48 units of study. This timing is typical for most students. The student graduates in December.\nResearch Preparation Track \u2013 a 20-month degree consisting of study for Fall and Spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of Fall and Spring study. Each semester consists of a minimum of 36 units of study. This timing is designed for students interested in extending their time at CMU for developing applied research skills in preparation for further graduate study or research- oriented employment. Note that the per-semester course load is lower, but the total cost is higher since four semesters of tuition are paid. This timing is also 14\n\n\nrecommended for students interested in pursuing a PhD after graduation. The student graduates in May.\n3.3.6.1 MCDS Curriculum\nAll MCDS students must complete 144 units of graduate study which satisfy the following curriculum:\n11-637 - Foundations of Computational Data Science \uf0b7 Four (4) additional MCDS Core Courses (10-601 Introduction to Machine Learning; 05-839 Interactive Data Science; 15-619 Cloud Computing; 11-631 Data Science Seminar; 48 units)\nThree courses (3) from one area of concentration curriculum (36 units) \uf0b7 Three (3) MCDS Capstone courses (11-634, 11-635 and 11-632) (36 units) \uf0b7 One (1) Elective: any graduate level course 600 and above in the School of Computer Science (12 units)\n3.3.6.2 Common MCDS Core Courses\nAll MCDS students are required to complete four common core courses in their first two semesters:\n10-601 - Machine Learning \uf0b7 15-619 - Cloud Computing \uf0b7 05-839 - Interactive Data Science \uf0b7 11-631 - Data Science Seminar\n3.3.6.3 Areas of Concentration\nIn addition to the common MCDS core, all students must complete at least one area of concentration, which consists of three courses in Analytics, Systems, or Human- Centered Data Science. Students consult with their academic advisor and choose one or more areas of concentration during their first semester, in preparation for enrolling in Spring classes.\nAnalytics concentration:\no One (1) Machine Learning course o One (1) Software Systems course o One (1) big data course\nSystems concentration:\no 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (elective, prerequisite for many\nadvanced Systems courses)\no Three (3) systems project courses \uf0b7 Human-Centered Data Science concentration:\no One (1) Methods course o Two (2) HCI courses\n15\n\n\nA detailed list of courses satisfying each concentration is contained in the MCDS Program FAQ.\n3.3.6.4 MCDS Capstone Courses\nAll MCDS students complete three Capstone courses: \uf0b7 11-634 - Capstone Planning Seminar (12 units) \uf0b7 11-635 - Capstone Research (12 units) \uf0b7 11-632 - Data Science Capstone (12 units)\nMCDS Program Learning Outcomes\nDesign, implement and evaluate the use of analytic algorithms on sample datasets.\nExplain how a machine-learning model is developed for and evaluated on real world datasets.\nDesign and execute experimental data collection and present resulting analyses using appropriate user experience (UX) techniques including interactive data visualizations.\nApply and customize analytics, systems and human-centered data science techniques to application-specific data science requirements and objectives. Identify tradeoffs among data science techniques (analytics, systems and/or human-centered) and contrast design alternatives, within the context of specific data science application domains.\n\nSurvey, interpret and comparatively criticize state of the art research talks and papers, with emphasis on constructive improvements.\nOrganize, execute, report on, and present a real world data science project in collaboration with other researchers/programmers.\nDepending on the concentration, additional learning outcomes are emphasized:\nAnalytics. Students electing to complete the Analytics concentration will also learn to:\nDesign, implement and evaluate a software system and machine-learning model on real world datasets at real world scale.\nAnalyze and document data science requirements in different application domains and survey as well as critique state of the art solutions for those requirements.\nSystems. Students electing to complete the Systems concentration will also learn to:\n16\n\n\n\nImplement and evaluate complex, scalable data science systems, with emphasis on providing experimental evidence for design decisions.\nAnticipate and avert structural and/or implementation problems with systems design, especially with scaling and tail distributions.\nHCDS. Students electing to complete the Human-Centered Data Science (HCDS) concentration will also learn to:\nDesign, implement and evaluate a user experience prototype to allow for clear understanding of data science solutions.\nApply social and behavioral research methods to data science problems to understand the human aspects of data collection and analysis.\nThroughout their coursework, students will take introductory courses on all those topics, practice them in advanced courses and seminars and demonstrate all learned skills in their Capstone project and internship. Students are encouraged to choose elective courses in the curriculum according to their professional goals and mastery of the main subjects.\n3.3.10 Capstone project\nThe capstone project consists of students working in a team or individually on a project. The capstone project integrates the educational experience of the student. A capstone project is typically a CMU research project, or an industry sponsored project; occasionally students define capstone topics through communication with the faculty. Students interested in defining their own capstone topics should discuss with the MCDS faculty as early as possible. The capstone project is a great opportunity for a student (or student team) to \u201cshow off\u201d their unique skills and accomplishments. Capstone projects have been instrumental in the hiring decisions for several employers.\n3.3.11 Elective courses\nElectives can be any graduate level course (numbered 600 or above) in the School of Computer Science. Students use their elective courses to enhance study in an area of interest or to explore new areas of interest.\n3.3.12 Undergraduate courses\nUndergraduate courses are taken to address an area of weakness in the student\u2019s prior preparation. Undergraduate courses (numbered less than or equal to 599) may be taken pass/fail or for credit but do not count toward the 144 units of eligible study: The course and course grade will appear on the student\u2019s transcript, and the course grade will factor as part of the student\u2019s QPA.\n17\n\n\n3.3.13 Independent study course\nIndependent study courses allow students to cover study of a particular area of interest, and are used when no formal course is available in a given subject area. Students who are interested in continuing to a Ph.D. degree often enroll in Independent Study, since it offers the opportunity to perform research directly with a faculty member. Independent study courses are considered electives.\nEach independent study course must be advised and approved by at least one faculty member. Agreement to supervise an independent study course is purely voluntary on the part of the faculty member. It is the duty of the student, therefore, to negotiate the terms and conditions of the independent study with the pertinent faculty members of CMU who will be supervising the study. These individuals are referred to as \u201cindependent study supervisors.\u201d Once the student finds someone who agrees to supervise such a course, he/she must:\n1. Students wishing to take an independent study must request approval from their academic advisor and complete proposal before the first day of classes in a given semester:\n2. Enter into an agreement with the independent study supervisor that includes course expectations, including deliverables.\n3. Secure the \u201cIndependent Study Contract Form\u201d from the MCDS administrator. 4. Complete the form, provide a brief description of the work to be done, including deliverables and how they will be graded.\n5. Secure signatures of both the student and the supervisor. Return the form to the MCDS administrator in order to obtain approval for the independent study from the Director.\nIndependent study contracts must be submitted no later than on the last day of the first week of classes in a given semester.\n3.3.14 Double counting courses\nNo course may be used to complete two MCDS degree requirements, nor may a course satisfy requirements in two degree programs.\n3.3.15 Courses outside of the School of Computer Science\nElective courses in other Schools at Carnegie Mellon may be taken with prior permission of the Director.\n3.3.16 Grades\nAll courses offered by the SCS CMU are graded on the 4.3 grading standard http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html. MCDS students must maintain a 3.0 overall average each semester to remain in good standing. A student must obtain a B- or better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student\n18\n\n\nreceives a C- or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree requirements. All courses must receive a letter grade; courses taken pass/fail do not count towards the MCDS degree.\nEnrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student- records/verifications/\n3.3.17 Student Review, Academic Probation and Academic Actions\nThe MCDS program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each semester in order to monitor individual student progress towards graduation regarding the fulfillment of curricular requirements, course grades, and academic integrity. Should a student\u2019s effort fall below the acceptable level of academic performance and/or fail to meet standards and policies established by Carnegie Mellon University, the student may be dismissed from the program.\nInfractions\nAfter each academic progress review, each student will receive a letter indicating the result of the review and their standing in the program. If applicable, the letter will also note the following infractions by the student in the given semester:\nCumulative QPA is below 3.0, resulting in the student being put on Academic Probation (see below)\nCumulative QPA is below 2.6, resulting in academic probation or possible dismissal (see below)\nAcademic Integrity Violation (AIV) deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee (see 3.7.2)\nMinimum QPA and Academic Probation\nStudents must maintain a cumulative QPA of 3.0 to remain in good standing with the program. Should a student\u2019s overall QPA drop below 3.0 during any given semester, he/she will be placed on academic probation for the following semester. In probation cases, the student will be required to\nenroll in courses as advised by the academic advisor, \uf0b7\nimprove his/her grades to no less than an overall 3.0 QPA in the following semester, and\nmeet any other goal set by the advisor during that period (e.g., fulfilling a core course requirement).\nIf a student\u2019s cumulative QPA drops below 2.6, the student will be considered at risk of being unable to complete the program and will be considered for dismissal. He/she will be required to meet the program director to discuss his/her situation. Only if, after that meeting, the MCDS program committee ascertains that the student is likely to complete\n19\n\n\nthe remaining program requirements in the allotted time, the student will be allowed to continue his/her studies in MCDS, and dismissed otherwise. If the student is allowed to continue their studies, they will be placed on academic probation for the following semester and is subject to the requirements above.\nDismissal\nA student may be dismissed from the program for any of the following cases:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the student has been put on academic probation and failed to meet the remedial requirements set by the advisor in the following semester, or committed an Academic Integrity Violation deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee while on academic probation If the student has a cumulative QPA of 2.6 or lower and the MCDS program committee does not ascertain that the student is likely to complete the remaining program requirements in the allotted time If the student has committed two Academic Integrity Violation deemed infractions by the MCDS committee (see 3.7.2) If the student has committed an Academic Integrity Violation infraction where the violation is deemed to be sufficiently egregious as determined by the MCDS program committee If the student has been found to infringe a University Policy, where such infringement is deemed grounds for dismissal\nStudents who realize that one of these situations may apply to them are strongly encouraged to meet with the academic advisor to discuss a plan to mitigate the situation. Students who find they are struggling in the program will have the best chances of success if they communicate early and often with the academic advisor.\n3.3.18 Incomplete grades\nCarnegie Mellon University students are expected to complete a course during the academic semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a grade of \u201cI\u201d (incomplete) may be given when a student has been unable to complete the work of a course. However, the work completed up to that date must be of passing quality and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students.\nBy awarding an \u201cI\u201d grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for the completion of the work and designate a default letter grade in the event that the student fails to complete the remaining work.\nStudents must complete the required course work by no later than the end of the following academic semester or sooner if required by the instructor.\n20\n\n\nThe instructor must record the permanent course grade by the last day of the examination period of the following semester, or the Registrar will automatically assign the default grade.\nIf further work has not been completed after one semester and a default grade is rendered, the default grade will become the grade of record.\n3.3.19 Change of grades and missing grades\nIf a grade has been assigned in error, it can be changed to a different permanent grade. The procedure for changing a grade is as follows: \uf0b7 Discuss the matter with the course instructor; provide evidence that the grade issued\n\n\nwas not the grade earned. If the instructor agrees, the student should contact the program administrator to process a Change of Grade Form in order to correct the grade that was issued in error. Generally, the instructor is the final authority for a course grade. If a grade has not been assigned, please notify the course instructor for the completion of a Missing Grade Form.\n3.3.20 Qualifying examinations and procedures (or equivalent)\nNone required.\n3.3.21 Thesis/dissertation\nNone required.\n3.3.22 On transfer to another program\nIf the requirements for the MCDS degree have not been completed when a student leaves to pursue another academic program, the degree will not be awarded. Completion of the MCDS degree does not guarantee admission into any doctoral degree program at Carnegie Mellon University. The courses that will be completed as part of the MCDS may serve to enhance one\u2019s application to these programs but will in no way insure admittance.\n3.3.23 Intellectual property policy\nThe MCDS degree program adheres to Carnegie Mellon University policy on intellectual property: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html\n3.3.24 Teaching requirements\nNone required. However, students are encouraged to apply for teaching assistant positions in courses where they have excelled.\n3.3.25 Language proficiency requirements\nNone required. However, non-native English speakers are encouraged to take advantage of the various support functions provided by the Intercultural Communication Center (ICC) and the Global Communication Center (GCC).\n21\n\n\n3.3.26 Academic Integrity and Policies on Plagiarism and Cheating\nThe university considers any form of cheating or plagiarism to be a serious violation of student ethics. The student is required to understand and rigorously follow only the permitted forms of collaboration as defined by the instructor in every class. The work you submit must be your own, unless you have clearly attributed it to others. You must not use the work of others without proper citation. And, you must not use resources, including other persons, except as authorized by the course or project for which you are submitting the work. Such conduct might be accepted or commonplace elsewhere, but it is not here. Be careful. Be warned. Failure to abide by these rules, even just once, can result in your permanent separation from the University without refund of money paid. Note that the policy requires the student to be informed and understand the academic integrity rules for every assignment or exam in a course.\nThe MCDS program strives to produce graduates with the highest standards of academic integrity. Academic Integrity Violations are taken very seriously and the MCDS program has a zero tolerance policy for multiple Academic Integrity Violations. A single violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program if deemed sufficiently egregious as determined by the MCDS program committee. If a student commits a second violation, the expected penalty is dismissal from the graduate program (see also academic progress review at section 3.3.17).\nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.\nA review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.\n3.3.27 Process for Appealing Final Grades\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and-academic-actions.html\nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error suc",
