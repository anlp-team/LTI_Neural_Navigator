Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 21\n\n\nQPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department's policies allow this.)\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html\n5.7 End of Semester Evaluation\nNear the end of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes their achievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester. At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degree.\nA good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual.\nIf a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \"black mark\" on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.\nIn the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.\n5.8 Satisfactory Progress\nIf a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program or strongly encourage the student to consider switching to the four-semester program (MIIS-21) to complete all the requirements.\n5.9 Academic Integrity\nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 22\n\n\nA review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.\nIn the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.\nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.\nIn any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.\nThe university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process.\nImportant note: The LTI implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program\u201d. Our procedure is as follows: a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide to not immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation. If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.\n6 Academic Policies\n6.1 MIIS Academic Policies\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 23\n\n\n6.1.1 Double Counting Courses\nA Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. (SCS policy)\n6.1.2 Duration of Study\nMIIS-16 students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in three semesters of academic study and one summer internship (16 months total).\nMIIS-21 students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in four semesters of academic study and one summer internship (21 months total).\nMIIS-16 students enrolled for part-time study are expected to complete the program in six semesters of academic study and one summer internship (27 months total).\nMIIS-21 students enrolled for part-time study are expected to complete the program in seven semesters of academic study and one summer internship (31 months total).\nSee also the \u2018Statute of Limitations\u2019 policy.\n6.1.3 Deferral\nMIIS students are given the opportunity to defer their enrollment. The deferral request must be approved by the program director. The deferral can only be used once for the period of one academic year.\n6.1.4 Maximum and Minimum Course Loads\nA student in the program may not take more than sixty (60) units per semester without permission from the program director.\nA student in the program must be registered for a minimum thirty-six (36) units per semester to be considered a full-time student or twelve (12) units per semester to be considered a part- time student. All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status. Reduced Course Load is not permitted for MIIS students. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, \u201cpermit of stay\u201d). (MIIS policy)\n6.1.5 Transfer Credit\nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the MIIS breadth requirements. The decision on whether a course may be used to satisfy a breadth requirement is made by the MIIS Program\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 24\n\n\nDirector. Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision.\nSatisfying a breadth requirement with a course from another institution does not reduce the number of CMU course units that must be taken to attain the MIIS degree.\nSee the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption\u201d on page 25.\n6.1.6 Transferring into the MIIS Program\nTransfers into the MIIS program are not permitted during a student\u2019s first semester at CMU. Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them.\nStudents may request to transfer into the MIIS program after completing their first semester and before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MIIS Program Director. The MIIS Program Director will inform the student about what application materials are required, for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities.\nThe MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request. The program will explicitly consider whether the coursework done prior to the transfer will allow the student to be \u201con schedule\u201d by the end of the spring semester, so that the student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall semester.\nMIIS students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS-16 to MIIS-21 and vice versa) after beginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests must be filed within the first semester of the program. It is highly recommended to not switch tracks more than once! Though not forbidden, multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration records of international students. Students also must understand that extension of their stay in the program will lead to additional financial obligations.\nU.S. citizens, virtually, have no restrictions on how many times they can switch if it is done for a legitimate reason. To confirm legitimacy of the reason to switch tracks ALL students must seek their advisor's approval and the approval of the Director of the MIIS program.\n6.1.7 Transferring Out of the MIIS Program\nThe MIIS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MIIS degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 25\n\n\n6.2 LTI Academic Policies\n6.2.1 Verification of Enrollment\nEnrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript, and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student- records/verifications/enrollment.html.\n6.2.2 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy\nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period.\n6.2.3 Time Away from Academic Responsibilities\nGraduate students should not assume that their time-off follows the academic calendar of courses. Many are coming from an undergraduate environment where their university employment followed their course schedule. For many graduate degree programs, there is an expectation that graduate students continue research during academic breaks and time away from campus which may or may not be negotiated with the students. If there are requirements for student time beyond a typical week day, this should be specified. Clarify that University Holidays are also student holidays, and students need to consult their faculty about coverage if they have challenges with taking time off during University Holidays. For example, if experiments are running that need to be monitored continuously students should speak with their faculty about arrangements to take an equal number of days off at another time.\n6.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption\nThe LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 26\n\n\n6.2.5 External Employment/Consulting\nSince the MIIS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment and/or consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss this with their Advisor. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment.\n6.2.6 Leave of Absence\nThe LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.\n6.2.7 Withdrawal of a Degree\nThe University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html.\n6.2.8 Winter and Summer Breaks\nStudents supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is typically allowed in the summer. The normal winter break policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks and takes vacation for the other two weeks.\n7 Safeguarding Educational Equity\n7.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/education-office/disability-resources/\nThe Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 27\n\n\nResources' secure online portal (https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/) or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process.\nStudents with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self- identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268- 6121.\n7.2 Sexual Misconduct Policy\nThe University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence, and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith.\nThe University\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual-misconduct/index.html.\nThe University\u2019s Policy Against Retaliation is available at\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html.\nIf you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources:\n\uf0a7 Office of Title IX Initiatives\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/, 412-268-7125, tix@cmu.edu\no\n\uf0a7 University Police\no https://www.cmu.edu/police/, 412-268-2323\nAdditional resources and information can be found at:\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources-and-information/resources.html.\n7.3 Gestational and Parental Accommodations\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html\nProviding holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols on this page are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families.\nStudents seeking any of the Parental Accommodations described below must register with the Office of the Dean of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling 412-268-2075.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 28\n\n\nStudents are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstance. At the time of registering, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, procedures, funding options and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with the student\u2019s academic department. Students should also consult with their academic advisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of Students.\nAccommodations for Gestational Parents\nThe birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic pursuits for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away from their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two options as possible accommodation:\nShort-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents \u2013 A short term absence from academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks. Short-Term Accommodation may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, where a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include extensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping courses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a Short-Term Accommodation will remain enrolled.\nFormal Leave of Absence\u2013 A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave Policy. Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full-semester, mini-semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the is taken. Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence ( https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html ) drop all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for the semester. International students must consult with the Office of International Education ( https://www.cmu.edu/oie/ ) before considering this option due to visa implications. leave\nFinancial Assistance for Student Parents\nCarnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who become parents while enrolled:\nInterest Free Loan \u2013 Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest- free parental loan (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/) from the Office of the Dean of Students.\n7.4 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate\nStudents\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 29\n\n\nThis policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual, or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html\n7.5 Employment Eligibility Verification\nIf you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/hr/restrict/employment-eligibility-verification-policy.pdf covering the university\u2019s I-9 and E-Verify requirements:\nEvery individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment.\n\nIndividuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required.\nFor more information, please see CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/recruiting/restrict/i-9- guidance.pdf , or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify https://www.cmu.edu/hr/service-center/new-faculty-staff/i-9-e- verify/index.html and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9 https://go.oncehub.com/I9Appointment.\nStudents who fail to complete the Form I-9 in a timely manner may have stipend payments suspended. If employed by the university, an individual who fails to timely complete the Form I-9 may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.\n8 Financial Support\n8.1 Graduate Student Funding\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 30\n\n\nThe LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional master\u2019s programs. Students are encouraged to seek financial aid and support from other sources. The HUB website (https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/index.html) provides the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links. Additional information on financial issues for graduate students can be found on the web at http://www.cmu.edu/hub/new-grad/.\nTeaching assistantships are awarded to faculty members who then award these positions to selected students. Teaching assistant duties include, but are not limited to, holding office hours, conducting recitation classes, and grading. There are minimum English proficiency requirements that must be met for a student to accept a teaching assistantship. Pennsylvania state law requires that all students who are not native speakers of English take and pass a state administered proficiency test. Support for teaching activities can be found through the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence, located in Warner Hall 425. Students who will be T.A.s for the department are encouraged to visit the Teaching Center and to take advantage of the information and services located there.\nStudents in the professional master\u2019s programs are not prohibited from seeking support as Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants. However, typically, fulltime master\u2019s students do not have time for these activities. Research Assistantships are most likely to be awarded to students in CMU\u2019s research-oriented degree programs.\nMIIS students can apply for TA positions only with the permission of the program director. Teaching Assistantships are especially discouraged for first semester students.\n8.2 University Financial Aid\nGraduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website (http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/graduate/index.html.) Students will find the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links.\n8.3 Health Insurance\nCarnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree seeking students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered by the University or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is \u201cenrolled as the dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance plan\u201d (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-health-insurance.html.\nIt is the responsibility of ea"}
