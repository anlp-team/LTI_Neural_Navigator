in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship.\nMission To create a transformative educational experience for students focused on deep disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-being.\nTo cultivate a transformative university community committed to (a) attracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; (b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and (c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential.\nTo impact society in a transformative way \u2014 regionally, nationally, and globally \u2014 by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the university campus.\n1.1 The MIIS Degree\nThe Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) is a professional degree offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MIIS degree provides advanced study and practical experience in areas of Computer Science focused on the processing and analysis of unstructured and semi-structured information, for example, text, image, video, speech, and audio information. It is a practice-oriented professional degree designed for students who want to rapidly master advanced content-analysis, mining, and intelligent information technologies prior to beginning or resuming leadership careers in industry and government.\nThere are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to the standard information outlined below. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) degree.\nWhile this handbook is specific to your academic experience in the department, there are several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, the Student Handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are included in Appendix A of this handbook.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 6\n\n\nAll policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies described in The Word, the Student Handbook and at the University Policies website.

In addition to this departmental graduate student handbook, the following resources are available to assist you in understanding community expectations:\nThe Word/Student Handbook\nwww.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword//index.html\nAcademic Integrity Policy\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- life/academic-integrity.html\nUniversity Policies Website\nwww.cmu.edu/policies/\nOffice of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs http://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/index.html\nDue to the changing nature of conditions and expectations surrounding public health and safety requirements please visit https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/ for the most up to date information\nPlease see Appendix A for additional information about The Word and University resources.\n1.4 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance\nCarnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state, or local laws or executive orders.\nInquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be directed to the university ombudsperson, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, telephone 412-268-1018. Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling 412-268-2000.\nCarnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report describing the university's security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault, and fire safety policies, and containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on the campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412-268-2323. The\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 8\n\n\nannual at www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports.\nsecurity\nand\nfire\nsafety\nreport\nalso\nis\navailable\nInformation regarding the application of Title IX, including to admission and employment decisions, the sexual misconduct grievance procedures and process, including how to file a report or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment, and how the university responds to such reports is available at www.cmu.edu/title-ix. The Title IX coordinator may be reached at 412-268-7125; or tix@cmu.edu.\n1.5 The Carnegie Mellon Code\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical, and moral conduct possible.\nThese standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.\nAs members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.\nThe discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.\nThe commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.\nThe Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/.\n2 The Language Technologies Institute\n2.1 Main Office\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nonline\nPage 9\n\n\nThe LTI mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental resources are in GHC 5404.\n2.2 Photocopies and Printers\nThe School of Computer Science provides several printers for use by students. The SCS Computer Facilities publishes a list of printers online at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printer-list.html\nTo use a printer, students are advised to register within the SCS centralized printing services and follow the instructions provided at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printing.html\n2.3 Computers for Master\u2019s Students\nStudents are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access university resources and complete course assignments. Laptops running Windows, MacOS, and Linux software are all acceptable.\nMaster\u2019s students will be given a CS user id. A CS user id is required to use the LTI computer cluster, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science has a Help Center located at GHC 4201. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu, extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line.\nMaster\u2019s students will be given access to the LTI\u2019s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.\n2.4 Academic Calendar\nThe Academic Calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html and provides information on all deadlines including registration dates, class start dates, add/drop deadlines, exam dates and more.\n3 Master\u2019s Degree Completion and Certification\n3.1 Standard Degree Requirements & Degree Certification\n3.1.1 Graduate Students\nCarnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 10\n\n\nGraduate Student Handbook.
