We asked some of the people involved with that milestone to tell us the story in their own words\u2014and to predict what comes next.\n\nThe computer science era at Carnegie Tech began in 1956, with the arrival of the university\u2019s first computer, an IBM 650 with magnetic-drum memory and a speed of approximately 60 instructions per second. Herb Simon (H\u201990), associate dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration\u2014now known as the Tepper School of Business\u2014established Tech\u2019s first Computation Center with the help of its first director, Alan Perlis (S\u201942).\n\nJIM MORRIS , S\u201963 (Professor of Computer Science): Simon, in retrospect, remade the university starting in about 1950. I think of him as the intellectual founder of our current university, because he brought in Allen Newell from the RAND Corporation, and he recruited Alan Perlis. That was the famous three-some that arguably created computer science nationally.\n\nALLEN NEWELL , IA\u201957 (U.A. and Helen Whitaker professor of computer science, interviewed in 1991): Computing comes to CMU, a highly technical college, and it comes to GSIA. They are the people who embraced it, mostly because the characters at the other end of the campus didn\u2019t have the good sense to decide that they wanted the computer down in their environment.\n\nMORRIS : Schools such as Harvard and Penn and some places in England had an engineering jump in computer science, but Simon was a social scientist. Simon came out of an operations research tradition during the second World War, when they were thinking of computers much more as a tool than as a thing to be \u201cbuilt.\u201d He and Newell pushed a much broader perception of what computer science was going to be, and it was more about using computers than building them.\n\nNEWELL (1991): The whole early part of this thing at GSIA (was) loaded with concern for management science. No concern with numerical computing; total concern with sort of non-numerical stuff \u2026 concern with human behavior was very much involved.\n\nMORRIS : Simon said, \u201cLook, this computer thing is going to be big, and it\u2019s going to be used for a lot more than just numerical calculations. It\u2019s going to be used for everything, and it\u2019s going to remake corporations.\u201d In that way, they got the whole university\u2014GSIA, psychology, humanities, social sciences\u2014energized about computers.\n\nIn 1956 and 1957, Simon, Newell and Cliff Shaw of RAND designed the Logic Theorist, a computer program that could discover proofs for theorems. They also developed linked-list data structures, the foundation of computer programming. In 1958, Perlis began teaching the first freshman-level computer programming course in the United States at Carnegie Tech.\n\nMORRIS : I was sitting in the fraternity house, having a beer, and a friend walked in and said, \u201cI\u2019m taking a course with this crazy bald-headed guy. It\u2019s a night course, but he says anyone who wants an \u2018A\u2019 can get an \u2018A.\u2019\u201d I said, \u201cWell! That sounds like a very interesting subject to me!\u201d (Laughs.) It was Alan Perlis, who was evangelizing computing at a very early stage. It was an exciting set of ideas, and I was sitting here as an undergraduate, having no clue that I was part of a revolution.\n\nIn 1961, the Computation Center and its then-new Bendix G-20 were moved to recently completed Scaife Hall. That same year, Carnegie Tech created an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program called Systems and Communications Sciences, combining elements of computer science, mathematics, psychology, business and electrical engineering. The university\u2019s first computer science Ph.D.s were graduates of this program.\n\nNEWELL (1991): It had its own graduate students, probably about 15. They all lived in the Computation Center, and it was fueled by DARPA funds, independently of anything else. From my point of view, DARPA never had any plans for us. We were just supposed to go be \u201cexcellent.\u201d\n\nMORRIS : In the 1960s, a guy at DARPA named J.C.R. Licklider said \u201cI\u2019m going to create computer science departments, and I\u2019m basically going to do it by spending a lot of money.\u201d His chosen method of doing that was to call up his friends at MIT, Carnegie Tech and Stanford, give them money, and say, \u201cGo do computer science.\u201d\n\nNEWELL (interviewed in 1985): You have to know something about the 1960s. In the 1960s, the norm was to get money. I didn\u2019t say the norm was to entrepreneur it\u2014the norm was to get it \u2026 Everything (at DARPA) was oriented toward providing scientists with funds. And the same thing was true at NIH.\n\nMORRIS : This was happening in universities all over the country. The Defense Department and the National Science Foundation were force-feeding money into universities, and Carnegie Tech got itself right in there.\n\nThe department emerges\n\nIn 1965, Carnegie Tech established its Computer Science Department with a $5 million grant from the R.K. Mellon Foundation. Perlis was the first department head.\n\nMARY SHAW , CS\u201972 (Alan J. Perlis University Professor of Computer Science): 1965 is the beginning of time as we know it. I graduated from Rice, and not too long after I was admitted to the (Carnegie Tech) interdisciplinary program, the (CS) department was formed. The whole enterprise was small\u2014probably a half-dozen faculty.\n\nNEWELL (1991): I don\u2019t think I even knew that we became a department. I never attended a single meeting to discuss it. Al (Perlis) and I talked about it a couple of times. We agreed it was sort of the right thing to do. Al went off and did it.\n\nANGEL JORDAN , S\u201952, E\u201959 (Emeritus University Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Robotics): It was only Ph.D.s\u2014no master\u2019s students, no undergraduates, and it was supposed to have a heavy dose of research, research, research.\n\nIn 1967, Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the nearby Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to form Carnegie-Mellon University. The Department of Computer Science moved into the newly created Mellon Institute of Science, later renamed Mellon College of Science, or MCS.\n\nSHAW : The curriculum at that time was, \u201ctake courses for two years and then look for a research advisor.\u201d The class that entered in 1968 essentially staged a palace revolution. They said, \u201cThis is not what we came to graduate school for\u2014this is more like an undergraduate program.\u201d And Al Perlis, to his great credit, said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s try it another way.\u201d\n\nNEWELL (1985): The whole structure of our program was set in 1969 because we had this student revolt. Now, there you (have) what has got to be, historically, an atypical response. Faculties do not normally respond to that.\n\nSHAW : The critical path to the degree is the student figuring out how to do research, and what we know about critical path analysis says that you want to get started on the critical path as early as possible. That\u2019s one of the insights that led to the curriculum change, and we haven\u2019t lost sight of it. We still match up students with research advisors, essentially as soon as they arrive, and we expect them to be doing research right away.\n\nNEWELL (1991): We ended up with a place where graduate students picked people to work with without concern for whether they get funded totally and completely \u2026 All you had were people doing science. Not little fiefdoms. It was all community. All because there weren\u2019t any financial constraints on people.\n\nSHAW : We were over in Porter Hall then\u2014I believe we had both floors of what was then the \u201cnew\u201d addition, and part of where Civil Engineering is now. The Computation Center and the department were very much one entity\u2014the Computation Center staff were contemporaries of the students, and the offices were intermingled. Most of us were single. Someone would go down the hall and say, \u201cIt\u2019s dinner time, who\u2019s coming?\u201d and a mix of students and staff would go out.\n\nDAN SIEWIOREK (Buhl University Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science): I joined the faculty in 1972. When I was a graduate student at Stanford, word was that at CMU, collaboration was in the water, in the air. You could get world-class people to collaborate on something that was in their area of expertise and get something greater than the sum of the parts.\n\nIn the 1960s, Jordan was a professor of electrical engineering at CMU. He became head of the Electrical Engineering Department in 1969.\n\nJORDAN : Alan Perlis eventually went to Yale, but prior to leaving, he came up with the idea that since the Department of Computer Science was so small, and wanted to grow, while the Electrical Engineering Department was large, and not particularly interested in growing, that we would create joint appointments\u2014associate or assistant professors of both electrical engineering and computer science. It was a very good idea\u2014in fact, a stroke of genius\u2014because poor Computer Science, with only seven or eight faculty members, was able to grow, and grow significantly. A number of great people came\u2014Bill Wulf (H\u201999), for instance, was one of our early luminaries, along with Gordon Bell (H\u201910).\n\nRaj Reddy joined the CSD in 1969 after three years as an assistant professor at Stanford. He brought with him research in speech, language and computer vision. But in 1970 and 1971, the new Computer Science Department faced its first crisis, as half of its tenured faculty members\u2014including Perlis\u2014left for other universities. Joe Traub was recruited from Bell Labs to CMU to become the new department head.\n\nJOE TRAUB (Edwin Howard Armstrong Professor of Computer Science, Columbia University): The department was still a jewel even though half of the faculty had left, and my number one priority was, \u201cGot to hire some great faculty.\u201d I invited 30 people here that first year. At one point, Raj Reddy came to me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re wearing out the faculty,\u201d because we were interviewing sometimes four or five people in one week ... one of the people we hired that first year was Dan Sieworiek.\n\nSIEWIOREK : When I got here, I was one of those 50/50 appointments in CS and EE. It was an attempt to get the departments to work closer together. We had, I think, 10 faculty members, and there was a great degree of cooperation. John Grason (E\u201965, CS\u201970), along with Gordon Bell, developed something called PDP-16 register transfer modules. Those allowed a junior-level class to build a PDP-8 class minicomputer in one or two labs, which was really unheard of at the time. Things were very exciting here.\n\nTRAUB : They were working on some very sexy stuff here with parallel processing, for instance. And even though they had lost some faculty members, Allen Newell and Herb Simon were still here, and they were giants. Some people have big reputations when you look at them from afar, but Allen Newell\u2014what you saw from afar was what you got up close \u2026 And I didn\u2019t have a fear about (office) space, because Science Hall (now Wean Hall) was brand new. The first thing I did was get us moved out of the old offices into Science Hall in July of \u201971.\n\nShaw organized and led CSD\u2019s first Immigration Course that fall while finishing her doctoral thesis.\n\nSHAW : I remember getting permission to take some classroom chairs from somewhere over in Porter Hall so that we could have seats for the first day of classes in the new building. I rounded up some other students and a dolly, and we went and moved chairs one evening, because it was easier than getting it done by official means.\n\nTRAUB : The thing about Carnegie that was so different from other universities was that it was so easy to get things done\u2014to make joint appointments, for instance \u2026 I like to build things\u2014I build institutions and I build theories. But I like to build new things so that I don\u2019t have to follow someone else\u2019s rules.\n\nSHAW : I joined the faculty when I graduated in 1972. There was work on programming language design, better ways to build compilers and operating systems research. AI was concerned with problem solving and chess, things like that. We had four faculty members interested in \u201cprogramming languages,\u201d which is what software people were called at the time.\n\nJORDAN : Our DARPA funding started to be significantly augmented with the help of Allen Newell and Raj Reddy. As Raj and others became prominent in the Department of Computer Science, they also had tremendous influence in other departments, such as Psychology, and later had influence elsewhere, such as the College of Fine Arts. It became quite interdisciplinary.\n\nTRAUB : My total budget for the department was very simple. It totaled $2 million\u2014in 1971 dollars\u2014$1.8 million from DARPA and $200,000 from CMU. Having 90 percent of the budget come from one source made me very nervous. We worked hard to diversify and increase our external funding by some $1 million, a good part of that coming from NSF.\n\n\u2018Greening up the campus with computer science\u2019\n\nSeveral large projects emerged in the Computer Science Department, including C.mmp, the first shared-memory multiprocessor computer, with 16 processing units. Siewiorek was co-lead on the construction of Cm*, a 50-processor computer. In 1975, Simon and Newell were awarded the A.M. Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for decision-making theory.\n\nAlthough Newell continued pursuing AI systems that emulated human thinking, he also became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, which released the Xerox Alto in 1973. Considered a forerunner to many of the computing environments that followed, Alto featured a graphical-user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse.\n\nNEWELL (1991): There never was a scientific publication issued on the Alto, but the Alto, in fact, was a very important thing for computer science.\n\nRAJ REDDY (Moza Bint Nasser University Professor of Computer Science and Robotics): Newell and I used to consult for Xerox PARC, so both of us were somewhat knowledgeable about the design of the Alto. It was clear to us that we should have these machines in our environment. I went to (PARC founder) George Pake and said, \u201cCan you give us 100 Altos?\u201d He said, \u201cI can probably give you five or 10.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, no, the whole place has to be supplied!\u201d We went to DEC and they hemmed and hawed, then we went to IBM, and they said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need a separate computer for each person,\u201d and offered us some sort of a mini-computer.\n\nWith help unavailable from IBM, DEC or Xerox, Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU\u2019s own \u201cthree-M\u201d machine\u2014a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.\n\nNEWELL (1985): There\u2019s a radical difference between computer science in the \u201960s and computer science in the \u201970s. It becomes much more project-oriented. CS in the \u201960s is really quite unstructured \u2026 In the \u201970s, the whole organization changes radically, because we were shaken up quite strongly by our sponsors. \u201cWell,\u201d they say, \u201cwe\u2019ve been supporting A.I. for 10 years, what have you done for us lately?\u201d\n\nTRAUB : It was a good thing that we had started to diversify our funding, because DARPA\u2019s new director didn\u2019t care for A.I. Suddenly, my budget went from $1.8 million to $1.5 million. Wham! Well, we had an emergency plan in place. There was a threat to cut it to $1.2 million, but to my recollection that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nOne non-governmental research sponsor was Pittsburgh\u2019s Westinghouse Electric Corp., then a large manufacturing conglomerate with interests ranging from consumer products to factory automation. In 1979, Westinghouse executive Tom Murrin collaborated with Jordan and Reddy to create the Robotics Institute, with Reddy as its first director.\n\nJORDAN : It was quite an accomplishment, and Raj Reddy was more or less the inspiration.\n\nSIEWIOREK : Raj was like the Wild West\u2014anything conceivable was possible. He could just go off and do anything. Have you ever heard of the \u201chalf-Raj\u201d and the \u201cfull-Raj\u201d? The half-Raj is when Raj says, \u201cDan, I\u2019d like to talk to you,\u201d and you know it\u2019s going to be very interesting. When you get the full Raj, he puts his arm around you, and you\u2019re going to be totally involved in a grand adventure.\n\nJORDAN : We had to do a lot of recruiting of faculty. There was quite a lot of participation from CIT\u2014electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering\u2014at one point, the Robotics Institute was kind of \u201cclaimed\u201d by the College of Engineering. However, robotics shared its computing facilities with the Department of Computer Science. That was an incentive for the Robotics Institute to start hiring computer scientists; up until that point, all of their hires had been engineers. More and more of their faculty was coming from computer science, and more of their students also were from computer science.\n\nSHAW : By then we were bursting at the seams. We were growing both the faculty and the student body at a pretty good clip.\n\nIn 1979, Traub left CMU to start a new Computer Science Department at Columbia. Office and laboratory space, scattered in Wean and Doherty halls, emerged as a serious concern for Traub\u2019s successor, A. Nico Habermann. By 1982, the Computer Science Department included more than 30 faculty members and 100 graduate students. \u201cThere are 16 faculty members who share offices,\u201d Habermann wrote in one memo to CMU President Dick Cyert. \u201cNone of the offices shared by them are suitable for double occupancy \u2026 the graduate student offices are overcrowded so severely that, in some cases, there is no room for a desk per student.\u201d Habermann told Cyert he was \u201cat the breaking point.\u201d\n\nREDDY : I wasn\u2019t privy to some of the discussions between Nico and the dean of science. There may have been some heated words used. Nico threatened to resign several times during his tenure as department head.\n\nSIEWIOREK : Nico said the Computer Science Department was sort of like a torus, with a cone on top. The surface area of the torus was allowing the faculty to collaborate with other faculty members. There\u2019s a very narrow neck, which is the department head, and then the rest of the university. Nico said the department head\u2019s job was to keep the administration off of the backs of the faculty.\n\nThe lack of physical space didn\u2019t prevent the university and the Computer Science Department from establishing another new research frontier: Development of a high-speed computer network that would reach virtually every room on campus, along with a GUI-based computing environment, and providing networked PCs or workstations for 7,000 students, faculty members and employees.\n\nREDDY : I was sitting at the airport with Dick Cyert, and I said, \u201cLook, the Computer Science Department is going forward with personal workstations, you really ought to think about making the whole university computer-centric.\u201d Allen Newell used to call it \u201cgreening up the campus with computer science.\u201d So Cyert asked Newell to head up a committee about that idea, and it turned into the Andrew Project. We went back to IBM and DEC and asked, \u201cAre you willing to become a partner in a campus-wide computing project?\u201d IBM made an offer, because they realized they were in danger of falling behind.\n\nMORRIS : I was working at Xerox PARC, and they offered me a nine-month sabbatical anywhere I wanted to go. We looked around the world and my wife convinced me that we should come back to Pittsburgh. I\u2019d been at Xerox for 10 years, we\u2019d developed all of this personal computer stuff\u2014I was enflamed by the potential of it\u2014and Xerox was going to abandon the products we\u2019d developed. It was a sensible business decision for Xerox, but at that point, many of us were bailing out of PARC. I said, \u201cOK, I\u2019ll take this job at CMU and try to create a system in the image of what we were doing at PARC.\u201d\n\nREDDY : People like Jim Morris, Al Spector and Satya (Mahadev Satyanarayanan, CS\u201979,\u201983) ended up doing a lot of strong technical work on the Andrew network and the Andrew File System. One of the great things that came out of that\u2014at the time I thought it was rather extravagant\u2014was the idea of a centralized or cloud-based system for files. Because there was this high-bandwidth connection, anything you touched automatically got downloaded. Many of the ideas that came out of Andrew have since become kind of a global solution, and now everyone uses them.\n\nSIEWIOREK : Satya\u2019s research continues to have an impact, and it stretches back to those Andrew File System days. The computing environment was fantastic. With Andrew, and then Wireless Andrew, our computing environment was the envy of other universities, and we were attracting world-class students.\n\n\u2018Software wars\u2019 and \u2018theory guys\u2019\n\nIn addition to robotics and AI, research at the Computer Science Department in the early 1980s centered on programming languages, hardware and architecture, as well as a field called \u201coperations performance and analysis.\u201d\n\nMORRIS : At a certain point, a visiting committee came into Carnegie-Mellon and said, \u201cYou\u2019re great in systems and artificial intelligence, but weak in theory.\u201d So Nico went out and decided to recruit some great theory guys.\n\nSIEWIOREK : Nico brought in Dana Scott, Dana brought in other people, and they put us on the theory map. Nico was a programming language guy, but he was also able to serve these growing, different constituencies.\n\nDANA SCOTT (Hillman University Professor of Computer Science, Philosophy and Mathematical Logic, Emeritus): I was a professor at Oxford at the time, but the financial situation with the Thatcher government in the U.K. was very bad. Out of the blue came a letter from Nico Habermann, offering me a professorship at CMU. He said, \u201cWe are so well-provided with funds that you\u2019ll never have to write a project proposal again.\u201d Well, the very fall I came to Pittsburgh, Bob Kahn, one of the fathers of the ARPANet, came to CMU and said, \u201cThe good times are over.\u201d And the rest of the time I was there, I was trying to think of ways to write project proposals.\n\nDARPA still had an interest in computer science\u2014but instead of funding general research, the agency was becoming application-driven, and was funding very targeted projects. One of those was a proposed \u201cSoftware Engineering Institute,\u201d which would study computer security and develop best practices in the design of operating systems.\n\nJORDAN : Nico and I knew something big was about to happen. The proposal that we wrote said the Software Engineering Institute had to come to Carnegie-Mellon. There was competition. We did a lot of lobbying. Some people called it the \u201csoftware war,\u201d but we won. And the first director of the SEI was the lead author of the proposal\u2014Nico Habermann.\n\nSHAW : Nico recruited me to become the chief scientist for the SEI, so I spent most of my time there for four or five years. I grew an entirely new understanding of the engineering issues of real software production, and I think it was good for me, and for the other people who have established connections with SEI over the years.\n\nMORRIS : Nico was greatly revered by virtually everyone in the department, and I liked him a lot. He was a great teacher, he did great research, and he was the first director of the Software Engineering Institute\u2014he made great contributions to the university.\n\nBecoming a misfit in MCS\n\nBetween 1982 and 1985, the amount of sponsored research in the Computer Science Department doubled, from $7.2 million to $15.3 million\u2014more than the other four departments in the Mellon College of Science combined.\n\nREDDY : Computer Science was the elephant in the room, because their budget was like 80 percent of the college budget. And that\u2019s without the Robotics Institute, because it reported directly to the provost.\n\nJORDAN : Yet when it came to budgeting, there were scare resources for the Computer Science Department, and Nico Habermann was very, very unhappy\u2014and that is an understatement.\n\nMORRIS : It was a politically fraught issue, because the Computer Science Department was exploding with research funding\u2014something CMU had never seen before, really. It wasn\u2019t fitting into the traditional department structure.\n\nSCOTT : Computer Science was the tail wagging the dog, and the decisions that the Mellon College of Science was making administratively didn\u2019t always match up with our needs. Computer science needed to have laboratories of a different kind than the so-called \u201cwet sciences\u201d do. Things also",
