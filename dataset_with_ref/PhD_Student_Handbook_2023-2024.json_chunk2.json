To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.)\nStudents should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than-standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs.\n3.11.3 International Students\nImmigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.\n4\nPh.D. Academic Policies\n4.1 Duration of Study\nThe target duration of the LTI Ph.D. is five years, although six years is also common.\nCarnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in this Graduate Student Handbook. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.\nEarly Completion The Ph.D. is granted when all degree requirements are satisfied. Some students complete the program in fewer than five years.\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 23\n\n\nExtended or Longer-than-Standard Competition Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.\nDoctoral students who require an extended period to complete their degree requirements must consult with their academic program and are subject to the CMU Policy on Doctoral Student Status (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/doctoral-student-status.html), specifically the \u201cTime to Degree.\u201d\n4.1.1 Department Policy on Double Counting Courses\nAn LTI Ph.D. student who uses courses taken as a Master\u2019s degree student (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other Master\u2019s degree offered by the school. The LTI (like other SCS units) allows its Ph.D. students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master\u2019s degree to receive the master\u2019s degree without any additional work. Any other sharing of coursework by an LTI student between more than one CMU degree (e.g., receiving an MLD Master\u2019s degree that includes courses taken as an LTI Ph.D. student) must be explicitly approved by the LTI, on a case-by-case basis, in advance.\n4.1.2 External Internships\nThe LTI provides summer support for its Ph.D. students, so Ph.D. students are expected to do research at Carnegie Mellon during the summer. However, outside experience can be a valuable educational experience, Ph.D. students in good standing are allowed to do an external internship. Some students may benefit from more than one internship, especially if they require access to proprietary data for their work, thus, with the approval of the student\u2019s advisor, a student can intern up to four (4) times during their Ph.D. degree. Interning more than four (4) times requires approval from the Ph.D. Program Director.\nAny internship must be planned in consultation with the student\u2019s advisor and the LTI Ph.D. Coordinator. If an internship is part of a fully-funded external fellowship (e.g., Microsoft Research Fellowship), the student does not need prior LTI approval, but should still coordinate with their advisor. International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract.\nInternships are typically scheduled during the summer. In certain cases, it is possible to schedule an internship during the fall or spring semester; the details are complex, especially for international students, so the student should discuss this as early as possible with the Ph.D. Program Director. International students must coordinate carefully with the LTI in any event, due to visa restrictions.\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 24\n\n\nNote that self-funded Ph.D. students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester internship) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while full-time LTI-sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend.\nAll students are cautioned to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas.\nIf the student is to receive academic credit for the internship, it must have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units, they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc.\n4.1.3 Maximum Courseload\nPh.D. students are permitted to register for a maximum of 54 units of coursework per semester.\n4.1.4 Pass/Fail Grades\nPass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement.\nGraduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.\n4.1.5 Transfer Credit\nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the Ph.D. course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the Ph.D. Program Director.\nTypically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision.\nSee the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption.\u201d\nA student may not receive transfer credit for more than four courses.\n4.1.6 Residency Requirements\nThe university requires Ph.D.s to spend at least one year of residency at Carnegie Mellon.\nThe SCS requires that all Ph.D. students must take at Carnegie Mellon a minimum of 48 units of the total coursework required by their respective programs.\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 25\n\n\n4.1.7 Transferring Into the Ph.D. Program\nThe LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master\u2019s programs into its Ph.D. program. The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time. However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities.\n4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program\nThe Ph.D. program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.\n4.2 LTI Academic Policies\n4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy\nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.\n4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption\nThe LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program.\nIf a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place.\nIf a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.\n4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting\nStudents funded by LTI research projects are expected to work primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE); otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status. See also External Internships.\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 26\n\n\n4.2.4 Leave of Absence\nThe LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Ph.D. Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.\nStudents taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university\u2019s leave of absence process.\n4.2.5 Satisfactory Progress\nIf a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove them from the program. See section on \u201cEnd of Semester Evaluation.\u201d\n4.2.6 Time Away from Academic Responsibilities\nPh.D. students that are supported by sponsored research, fellowships, or scholarships are expected to remain on campus and work fulltime on their education and research throughout the year, regardless of whether classes are in session or not. 40 hours per week is a common level of effort.\nOrdinarily, students are not expected to work during official university holidays, however students may need to consult their advisor about expectations and alternate arrangements if there are challenges with taking time off during a university holiday, for example, if an experiment requires continuous monitoring. In such situations, the student and their advisor may agree for the student to take an equal number of days off at another time.\nStudents with fulltime financial support are entitled to four weeks per year of paid vacation, which must be scheduled in consultation with their advisor.\n4.3 CMU Academic Policies\n4.3.1 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures\nAdd, drop, withdrawals, and pass/no pass election procedures and deadlines are described on a Hub web page. Note that the deadlines for doctoral courses may differ slightly; see the deadlines for doctoral course sections in the Academic Calendar.\nDoctoral students, visiting/non-degree students, and certificate students do not receive vouchers and do not participate in the voucher process.\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 27\n\n\n4.3.2 Doctoral Student Status\nCarnegie Mellon\u2019s Policy for Doctoral Student Status covers time limits on doctoral degree student status, a definition of All But Dissertation status, a definition of In Residence (ABD) and In Absentia (ABS) status for doctoral students and the tuition and fees charged for students In Residence and students In Absentia.\n4.3.3 ABD versus ABD in Absentia (ABS)\nFollowing university policy, an LTI Ph.D. student is considered \"All-But-Dissertation\" (ABD) when they have completed all requirements for the LTI's Ph.D. degree except for the thesis defense (in particular, the student has had a thesis proposal accepted). Note that ABD status is different from ABD in absentia (ABS) status. A student in ABS status cannot receive any support from the university (including any research projects within the university), cannot use most university facilities, and does not pay any tuition until they are ready to defend their thesis. ABS students must register for five (5) units of dissertation research in the semester they defend; in keeping with university policy, the LTI (and its projects and faculty) cannot pay for these five units. The student can (and should) register for these five units only after they defend; just in case the defense date slips to the next semester.\nStudents entering ABD or ABS status must complete the All But Dissertations Status Agreement.\n4.3.4 Statute of Limitations: Time to Degree\nAs outlined in the Doctoral Student Status Policy, students will complete all requirements for the Ph.D. degree within a maximum of ten years from original matriculation as a doctoral student, or less if required by a more restrictive department or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a doctoral degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered doctoral degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department\u2019s recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption.\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 28\n\n\nStudents, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.\n4.3.5 University Financial Aid\nGraduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website. Students will find the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links.\n4.3.6 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities\nThe Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability Resources' secure online portal (https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/) or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process. Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about to access@andrew.cmu.edu , or call (412) 268-6121.\nthe process can be directed\n4.3.7 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures\nGraduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here.
