Welcome\nWelcome to the Language Technologies Institute. While this handbook (and your college graduate student handbook) is specific to your academic experience in the LTI, there are several other resources and offices that graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, the student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, and others, are included in Appendix A of this handbook.\n1.1 Vision\nCarnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society through continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship.\n1.2 Mission\nTo create a transformative educational experience for students focused on deep disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-being.\nTo cultivate a transformative university community committed to (a) attracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; (b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and (c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential.\nTo impact society in a transformative way \u2014 regionally, nationally, and globally \u2014 by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the university campus.\n1.3 The MIIS Degree\nThe Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) is a professional degree offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MIIS degree provides advanced study and practical experience in areas of Computer Science focused on the processing and analysis of unstructured and semi-structured information, for example, text, image, video, speech, and audio information. It is a practice-oriented professional degree designed for students who want to rapidly master advanced content-analysis, mining, and intelligent information technologies prior to beginning or resuming leadership careers in industry and government.\nThere are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 6\n\n\nhandbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to the standard information outlined below. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) degree.\nWhile this handbook is specific to your academic experience in the department, there are several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, the Student Handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are included in Appendix A of this handbook. All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies described in The Word, the Student Handbook and at the University Policies website. It is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines.\n1.4 MIIS Contact Information\nThe people responsible for administering the MIIS degree are:\nBrianna Eriksen Academic Program Manager GHC 6415 412-268-4277 bfreema2@andrew.cmu.edu\nTeruko Mitamura Program Director, MIIS Professor, LTI GHC 6711 412-268-6596 teruko@andrew.cmu.edu\nKate Schaich Administrative Manager GHC 6415 412-268-4788 kschaich@andrew.cmu.edu\nRobert Frederking Chair of Graduate Programs, LTI Principal Systems Scientist 412-268-6656 ref@cs.cmu.edu\nMona Diab Director, LTI GHC 5415 412-268-3669 mdiab@andrew.cmu.edu\nIn addition, students may confer with the Graduate Education Office (graded@andrew.cmu.edu) regarding issues of process or other concerns as they navigate conflicts.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 7\n\n\nThe Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5th and 6th floors of the Gates Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Pittsburgh campus.

Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.\nAs members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.\nThe discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.\nThe commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.\nThe Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/.\n1.7 University Policies and Expectations\nIt is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines.
