It was arguably the first college devoted solely to computer science in the United States, and a model for others that followed. But CMU\u2019s computer science era begins much earlier\u2014in 1956, with the arrival of an IBM 650 computer on the campus of what was then known as Carnegie Institute of Technology. The IBM 650 had magnetic-drum memory and a processing speed of approximately 60 instructions per second. Herb Simon (H\u201990), associate dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration\u2014now known as CMU\u2019s Tepper School of Business\u2014established Carnegie Tech\u2019s first Computation Center with the help of its first director, Alan Perlis (S\u201942).\n\nFirst freshman-level computer science course\n\nIn 1956 and 1957, Simon, Allen Newell (IA\u201957) and Cliff Shaw of RAND designed the Logic Theorist, a computer program that could develop proofs for theorems in much the same way a human would work. They also developed linked-list data structures, the foundation of computer programming. Perlis, Simon and Newell are credited with defining the term \u201ccomputer science\u201d as \u201cthe theory and design of computers,\u201d as well as (in Newell\u2019s words) \u201cthe study of the phenomena arising from them.\u201d In 1958, Perlis began teaching the first freshman-level computer programming course in the United States at Carnegie Tech.\n\nComputer science Ph.D. program created\n\nIn 1961, the Computation Center and its newest computer, a Bendix G-20, were moved to recently completed Scaife Hall. That same year, Carnegie Tech created an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program called Systems and Communications Sciences, combining elements of computer science, mathematics, psychology, business and electrical engineering. The university\u2019s first computer science Ph.D.s were graduates of this program.\n\nComputer Science Department established\n\nIn 1965, Carnegie Tech established its Computer Science Department, or CSD, with a $5 million grant from the R.K. Mellon Foundation. Perlis was the first department head. There were no undergraduates; only Ph.D. students were admitted, and the department\u2019s focus was on research, much of it funded by the federal government through the Defense Department\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In 1967, Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the nearby Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to form Carnegie-Mellon University. The Department of Computer Science moved into the newly created Mellon Institute of Science, later renamed Mellon College of Science, or MCS. Future SCS dean Raj Reddy joined the CSD in 1969 after three years as an assistant professor at Stanford. He brought with him research in speech, language and computer vision. But in 1970 and 1971, the new Computer Science Department faced its first crisis, as half of its tenured faculty members\u2014including department head Perlis\u2014left for other universities. Joe Traub was recruited from Bell Labs to CMU to become the new department head.\n\nMulti-processor machines emerge\n\nCSD emerged from the brief crisis as a highly agile, interdisciplinary entity, with many new faculty members taking joint appointments with other CMU departments. Several large projects emerged in the Computer Science Department, including C.mmp, the first shared-memory multiprocessor computer, with 16 processing units, and Cm*, a 50-processor computer. These computers were the forerunners of today\u2019s ubiquitous multi-core desktops and laptops.\n\nTuring Awards and a Nobel Prize\n\nIn 1975, Simon and Newell were awarded the A.M. Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. (As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings, sometimes considered the Nobel Prize of computing.) Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision-making theory. As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, which released the Xerox Alto in 1973. Considered a forerunner to many of the computing environments that followed, Alto featured a graphical-user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse. Inspired by Alto, Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU\u2019s own \u201cthree-M\u201d machine\u2014a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.\n\nLaunching a Robotics Institute\n\nIn 1979, an executive at Pittsburgh\u2019s Westinghouse Electric Corp., Tom Murrin, collaborated with Jordan and Reddy to create the Robotics Institute, with Reddy as its first director. By 1982, the Computer Science Department included more than 30 faculty members and 100 graduate students.\n\nThe best-wired campus in the world\n\nWorking with IBM in the early 1980s, the university and the Computer Science Department established another new research frontier: Development of a high-speed computer network that would reach virtually every room on campus, along with a GUI-based computing environment, and providing networked PCs or workstations for 7,000 students, faculty members and employees. Called the Andrew Project, it turned Carnegie Mellon into the best-connected, most-wired university in the world\u2014a process Newell called \u201cgreening up the campus with computer science.\u201d CMU also became home to a new Software Engineering Institute, funded by the Defense Department, to study computer security and develop best practices in the design of operating systems. Between 1982 and 1985, the amount of sponsored research in the Computer Science Department doubled, from $7.2 million to $15.3 million\u2014more than the other four departments in the Mellon College of Science combined.\n\nA \u201cschool of computer science\u201d is proposed\n\nFeeling that CSD\u2019s needs were inadequately represented in MCS, CSD head A. Nico Habermann and then-CMU provost Angel Jordan in 1986 wrote a white paper proposing the creation of \u201ca School of Computer Science.\u201d Responding to concerns from the faculty that the change might be taking place too quickly, the university first established a free-floating Department of Computer Science. The experiment, which lasted two years, was an unqualified success. Separately, and also in 1986, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center was created as a joint effort between CMU, the University of Pittsburgh and Westinghouse Electric Corp.\n\nSCS is officially formed\n\nCMU\u2019s Faculty Senate in the fall of 1988 agreed to President Richard Cyert\u2019s plan to elevate the Department of Computer Science to college status. In addition to the Computer Science Department, SCS also incorporated the Robotics Institute, the Center for Machine Translation, and researchers from the Information Technology Center, which had developed Andrew. On Dec. 13, 1988, Cyert (H\u201989) told faculty and staff that Habermann had been appointed CMU\u2019s first Dean of Computer Science, effective Dec. 1, and that the School of Computer Science would soon begin operations. SCS made its formal debut on Dec. 22, 1988, with a reception in the Wherrett Room of Skibo Hall, CMU\u2019s student union. The official announcement of CMU\u2019s new \u201cgraduate School of Computer Science\u201d was made Jan. 3, 1989.\n\nUndergraduate degrees begin\n\nFor several years, undergraduates interested in computer science pursued an \u201capplied math/CS\u201d bachelor\u2019s degree offered by the Mathematics Department. CSD professor Mary Shaw (CS\u201972) led CMU\u2019s first effort to design an undergraduate curriculum solely in computer science. She and her colleagues were guided by the Carnegie Plan\u2014guidelines established in 1938 under Carnegie Tech President Robert Doherty (A\u201940, E\u201948, H\u201950), outlining the principles of a sound professional education. Drawing on Shaw\u2019s plan and also on the work of other faculty members, an undergraduate program in computer science was created during the 1989-90 academic year. Seven CS majors were admitted to the program as sophomores. Another 73 undergraduates were admitted in 1990\u201391. By 1995, there were 401 undergraduates in the School of Computer Science; in fall 2013, more than 600 undergraduates made up about 37 percent of student enrollment at SCS, along with more than 600 master\u2019s degree students.\n\nNew departments, new areas of study\n\nAlong the way, the Center for Machine Translation became the Language Technologies Institute, and other new departments were formed, including the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (1993), the Institute for Software Research (1999), the Machine Learning Department (2006) and the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology (2009). SCS\u2019s seven degree-granting departments draw faculty and students from a wide variety of disciplines, including engineering, mathematics, social sciences, linguistics and design.\n\nCommitted to extending our founders\u2019 vision\n\nThe School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University enters its second quarter century as a world-leading educational and research institution, embracing all facets of computing. Its graduate programs are consisted ranked with the best in the world by a leading U.S. magazine, while its undergraduate programs are also rated the best in the U.S. by corporate recruiters. In 2013, SCS had 284 faculty members and a total student enrollment of nearly 1,700, including undergraduate, master\u2019s and Ph.D. students, and conducted $124 million in research. Indeed, by itself, the Robotics Institute is the largest university robotics research group in the world, with more than 500 people and more than 100 ongoing research projects. A half-century ago, Perlis, Simon and Newell outlined a vision for computer science. The School of Computer Science at CMU remains committed to continuing and extending their vision in the context of big data and connected computing in the 21st century.\n\nBack to top",
