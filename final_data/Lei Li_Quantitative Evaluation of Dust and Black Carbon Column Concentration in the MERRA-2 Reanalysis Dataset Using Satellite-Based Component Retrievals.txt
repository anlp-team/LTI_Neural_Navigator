Abstract: The aerosol optical property products of Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis dataset have been extensively investigated on a global or regional scale. However, the understanding of MERRA-2 aerosol component prod- ucts on an extensive temporal and spatial scale is inadequate. Recently, the aerosol component products have been derived from the observations of Polarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Reﬂectances/Polarization and Anisotropy of Reﬂectance for Atmospheric Science coupled with observations from a Lidar (POLDER/PARASOL). This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the MERRA-2 reanalysis dust and black carbon (BC) column concentration using independent satellite-based aerosol component concentration retrievals. Both GRASP/Component and MERRA-2 reanalysis products can capture well the temporal variation in dust column concentration over the dust emission resource and downwind dust-dominated regions with the correlation coefﬁcient (R) varying from 0.80 to 0.98. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 20~70%, except in the Taklamakan Desert and Bay of Bengal, where the relative differences can be negative. The differences in dust column concentration over the African dust regions are larger than that over the Asian dust regions. Similar temporal variations in BC column concentration are characterized by both GRASP/Component BC retrievals and MERRA-2 BC products with R of about 0.70~0.90, except in the North China Plain region. We should pay more caution with the regional applicability of MERRA-2 component products when large differences and high correlation coefﬁcients are obtained simulta- neously. The results are favorable for identifying the behavior of MERRA-2 reanalysis component estimation in a new view and demonstrate a practical application of the satellite-based component retrievals, which could make more contributions to the improvement of model estimation in the near future.

1. Introduction
The characterizations of total aerosol optical depth (AOD) variations are extensively discussed by many researchers on a global [1–3] or regional scale [4–6] based on satellite remote sensing products derived from different instruments. The spatial and temporal distributions of aerosol optical properties associated with dust particles also have been investigated using satellite measurements in many studies. Speciﬁcally, the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to characterize the properties of dust aerosols and distinguish the dust

emission sources [7–9]. In addition, there are several studies focusing on the variability of dust optical depth (DOD) over the key global dust regions based on the satellite mea- surements, such as MODIS DOD products [10,11], Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) DODs products [12], and CALIOP DOD products [13].
Global climate models can beneﬁt from the enhanced space-based and ground-based remote sensing observations of aerosols for further knowledge of aerosols’ impacts on air quality and climate change. The assimilation of observations employed by models is helpful for an enhanced representation of aerosols [14–16]. Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) is the ﬁrst multidecadal reanalysis generated from a global assimilation system developed for simultaneously as- similating meteorological and aerosol observations. MERRA-2 considers the assimilation of bias-corrected AOD from satellite observations, including MODIS, Advanced Very-High- Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) [17], MISR [18], and Level-2 AOD of the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) [19]. The signiﬁcant impacts of AOD assimilation in the MERRA-2 have been demonstrated in many studies [20]. Speciﬁcally, the perfor- mance and stability of the MERRA-2 assimilation system, together with the validation of MERRA-2 AOD, have been evaluated by Randles et al., (2017) [21]. The aerosol products such as AOD, aerosol index (AI) and absorption AOD (AAOD), and PM2.5 have been assessed by Buchard et al., (2015, 2016, 2017) [20,22,23] using available measurements, as well as its capabilities and limitations for speciﬁc aerosol events including pollution, biomass burning, volcanic, and mineral dust events [20]. The MERRA-2 aerosol output has been extensively applied to various studies. Speciﬁcally, it can be used to forecast air quality by models [22,24], examine the interactions between aerosols and climate/weather conditions [25,26], and improve atmospheric retrievals from satellite observations [27]. A case of dust event and its transport were also investigated using the MERAA-2 data [20]. Because of inadequate constraints on emissions and insufﬁcient knowledge of physical parameterizations (e.g., mixing, conversion, and interactions), aerosol models remain not negligibly uncertain [28,29]. The discrepancies between model estimation and observations are partly attributed to emissions inventory assumption [30,31]. For instance, several anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the key regions of China have shown decreasing trends since 2006, such as anthropogenic black carbon (BC) emission has a statistically noteworthy trend of −1.4% per year in the Peking University (PKU) inventory. However, anthropogenic BC emission in Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) inventory shows an increasing trend of 2.7% over eastern China for the period 2006–2014, which is a complete reversal of the trend of PKU inventory. Therefore, the models that employ CEDS inventory cannot successfully capture the practical descending tendency [30]. Assimilated AOD observations in MERRA-2 cannot provide sufﬁcient information and constraints on the fractions or content of aerosol species.
Although several studies [20–23] demonstrated that the aerosol assimilation system in MERRA-2 reanalysis data could provide comparable simulations of measured aerosol properties, aerosol component products need to be assessed and validated globally by observations for further improvement due to their no constraints in the data assimilation system. AOD is observation-constrained directly by available data in MERRA-2; the evalu- ations of other aerosol diagnostics are more critical than AOD. Therefore, the concentration of aerosol components, which are not directly constrained by measurements during the as- similation process of MERRA-2, needs to be evaluated and validated globally in a scientiﬁc and systematic way.
This study aims to investigate the temporal differences of mineral dust and black car- bon column concentration between the MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset and satellite-measured component retrievals over some regions of interest from 2005 to 2013. The innovations of this study are emphasized below regarding the contributions to the scientiﬁc community. First, this study relies on satellite-measured component retrievals and aims to validate the mineral dust and black carbon column concentration products in the MERRA-2 reanal- ysis dataset in detail over speciﬁc regions. The assessment is critical for understanding

MERRA-2 reanalysis of mineral dust and black carbon column concentration. Second, quite a few studies focus on validating component column concentration in the MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset rather than aerosol optical property products. Even though the pattern and amount of aerosol optical parameters are quite reasonable on a global scale, the aerosol composition products remain unvalidated due to the lack of measurements on a large scale. It should be noted that this is the ﬁrst study assessing the mineral dust and black carbon column concentration across the major regions of interest over the globe, highlighting the potential role of satellite-measured retrievals and the MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset in the aerosol component studies.
The structure of this study is presented as follows. Section 2 is divided into three sub- sections as the description of MERRA-2 reanalysis product (Section 2.1), satellite-measured component retrievals (Section 2.2), and the regions of interest for these two components (Section 2.3). Section 3 describes results and discussions for mineral dust (Section 3.1) and BC (Section 3.2) column concentration. Finally, the main ﬁndings of the current study are summarized in Section 4. This study demonstrates a practical application of the satellite- measured component retrievals and provides the ﬁrst assessment of monthly means for mineral dust and BC column concentration in the MERRA-2 over the key regions globally using satellite remote sensing observations.
2. Data and Regions 2.1. MERRA-2 Reanalysis Product
The MERRA-2, released and distributed by NASA in 2017, shows signiﬁcant im- provements respecting MERRA-1 [32], such as the online interaction between aerosol and radiation ﬁelds [21]. The GEOS-5 Earth system model [33] and the 3-D variational data assimilation analysis system [34] are employed in MERRA-2. A detailed description of the modeling system in MERRA-2 can be found in Gelaro et al. (2017) [35], and detailed information about the treatment of aerosols can be found in Randles et al. (2017) [21]. Major aerosol types (i.e., black carbon, organic carbon, mineral dust, inorganic salts) are estimated by the GEOS-5 model, which is coupled to the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport model (GOCART) [36,37] aerosol module. MERRA-2 reanal- ysis dataset, including mineral dust and black carbon column concentration products (MERRA-2 tavgM_2d_aer_Nx), can be downloaded from the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) at http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/mdisc/ (accessed on 1 October 2022).
2.2. Satellite-Measured Component Retrievals
Polarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Reﬂectances/Polarization and Anisotropy of Reﬂectance for Atmospheric Science coupled with observations from a Lidar (POLDER/ PARASOL) were launched on December 18, 2004, to obtain the information of multispectral, multidirectional, and polarized radiances and it can provide total radiance measurements at 9 wavelengths (440, 490, 565, 670, 763, 765, 865, 910, and 1020 nm) together with polarization measurements at 3 wavelengths (490, 670, and 865 nm) [38]. Recently the advanced aerosol composition products retrieved from POLDER/PARASOL by the component approach in the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP/Component) algorithm have been released publicly as daily, monthly, seasonal, yearly, and climatologi- cal datasets in Level-2 and Level-3 [39]. A detailed introduction to the GRASP algorithm and the speciﬁc component retrievals can be found in Dubovik et al. (2011, 2014) [40,41] and Li et al. [40], which is open-source code at https://www.grasp-open.com. Brieﬂy, in the GRASP/Component approach, the refractive index of each component, together with fractions, is used by the forward model for estimating the refractive index of an aerosol mixture to simulate remote sensing measurements. Therefore, aerosol species, including black carbon, brown carbon, mineral dust, soluble inorganic salts, etc., can be obtained by the component approach [39,40]. In the current component products [39], a mixing rule of Maxwell–Garnett (MG) approximation that considers different insoluble species mixing

in the soluble host was employed for the calculation of aerosol mixture components. The quality-ﬁltered products with the measured resolution are represented in Level-2. The products with different resolutions of 0.1◦ and 1◦ are represented in Level-3. Here, in this study, the GRASP/Component mineral dust and black carbon retrievals are re-gridded into the resolution of 0.5◦ × 0.625◦ to compare with the corresponding MERRA-2 products using the quality-ﬁltered GRASP/Component products with the resolution of 0.1◦ [39]. It is noted that based on the sensitivity tests and uncertainty assessments [39–41], the uncertainties in BC retrievals are about 50% or smaller for moderate and high aerosol loading (AOD at 440 nm ≥ 0.4) and when the proportion of BC is higher than 0.01. The estimated uncertainty for the mineral dust retrieval decreases signiﬁcantly (from 100% to below 50%) when the proportion of dust is higher than 0.1. The component retrieval uncertainties are mainly associated with the refractive index of each component employed by the assumption in the component algorithm [40].
2.3. Regions of Interest 2.3.1. Dust Desert and Downwind Dust-Dominated Regions
Figure 1 shows the regions of interest for the comparisons of monthly dust column concentration between satellite-measured retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis data in the following assessment analysis. The monthly comparisons are performed for mineral dust column concentration over these speciﬁc regions of interest. The full names of each region, as well as the corresponding deﬁned areas, are listed in Table 1 [42]. The regions of the Sahara Desert (SAH), Bodélé Depression (BOD), Middle East (MIE), Taklamakan Desert (TAK), and Gobi Desert (GOB) with solid rectangles represent dust emission resource regions. The regions of Eastern Tropical Atlantic (ETA), Sub-Sahel (SUS), Mediterranean Basin (MED), Arabian Sea (ARA), and Bay of Bengal (BOB) with dashed rectangles represent the important downwind dust-dominated regions.
Level-3 [39]. A detailed introduction to the GRASP algorithm and the specific component retrievals can be found in Dubovik et al. (2011, 2014) [40,41] and Li et al. [40], which is open-source code at https://www.grasp-open.com. Briefly, in the GRASP/Component approach, the refractive index of each component, together with fractions, is used by the forward model for estimating the refractive index of an aerosol mixture to simulate remote sensing measurements.

In the current component products [39], a mixing rule of Maxwell–Garnett (MG) approximation that considers different insoluble species mixing in the soluble host was employed for the calculation of aerosol mixture components. The quality-filtered prod-ucts with the measured resolution are represented in Level-2. The products with different resolutions of 0.1° and 1° are represented in Level-3. Here, in this study, the GRASP/Com-ponent mineral dust and black carbon retrievals are re-gridded into the resolution of 0.5° × 0.625° to compare with the corresponding MERRA-2 products using the quality-filtered GRASP/Component products with the resolution of 0.1° [39]. It is noted that based on the sensitivity tests and uncertainty assessments [39–41], the uncertainties in BC retrievals are about 50% or smaller for moderate and high aerosol loading (AOD at 440 nm ≥ 0.4) and when the proportion of BC is higher than 0.01. The estimated uncertainty for the mineral dust retrieval decreases significantly (from 100% to below 50%) when the proportion of dust is higher than 0.1. The component retrieval uncertainties are mainly associated with the refractive index of each component employed by the assumption in the component algorithm [40]. 2.3. Regions of Interest 2.3.1.

Results and Discussion This section presents the comparisons of mineral dust and BC column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals in the global key regions for the period from March 2005 to October 2013. It provides a fun-damental evaluation of the quality of aerosol component reanalysis fields using the satel-lite-measured aerosol component concentration to examine the magnitude of mineral dust and BC column concentration because measured aerosol component concentration data were not assimilated in the MERRA-2 reanalysis. 3.1. Dust Column Concentration There are many natural dust emission sources globally, such as the Sahara region [8,44], the Middle East, Arabian Peninsula [8,9], Taklamakan desert in northwestern China, and Gobi desert across northern China–southern Mongolia [9], etc., making dust particles have major contributions to aerosol mass loading. The prevailing winds can take the dust particles to long-distance areas up to thousands of kilometers from emission sources. For instance, the Atlantic Ocean is under the influence of dust particles emitted from the Sahara region in North Africa [45–47]. Dust aerosols also can be transported from the Sahara Desert in North Africa toward the Mediterranean and Europe [48,49]. There-fore, some key regions of dust deserts and downwind dust-dominated regions globally (shown in Figure 1) are selected to investigate the differences in mineral dust column con-centration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component re-trievals. 3.1.1. Sahara Desert The Sahara (SAH) desert region is of great interest in the comparison of satellite-measured and MERRA-2 dust column concentrations with the most active and extensive natural dust sources. According to Figure 3, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concen-tration over the SAH region. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in

3. Results and Discussion
This section presents the comparisons of mineral dust and BC column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals in the global key regions for the period from March 2005 to October 2013. It provides a fundamental evaluation of the quality of aerosol component reanalysis ﬁelds using the satellite-measured aerosol component concentration to examine the magnitude of mineral dust and BC column concentration because measured aerosol component concentration data were not assimilated in the MERRA-2 reanalysis.
3.1. Dust Column Concentration
There are many natural dust emission sources globally, such as the Sahara region [8,44], the Middle East, Arabian Peninsula [8,9], Taklamakan desert in northwestern China, and Gobi desert across northern China–southern Mongolia [9], etc., making dust particles have major contributions to aerosol mass loading. The prevailing winds can take the dust particles to long-distance areas up to thousands of kilometers from emission sources. For instance, the Atlantic Ocean is under the inﬂuence of dust particles emitted from the Sahara region in North Africa [45–47]. Dust aerosols also can be transported from the Sahara Desert in North Africa toward the Mediterranean and Europe [48,49]. Therefore, some key regions of dust deserts and downwind dust-dominated regions globally (shown in Figure 1) are selected to investigate the differences in mineral dust column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals.
3.1.1. Sahara Desert
The Sahara (SAH) desert region is of great interest in the comparison of satellite- measured and MERRA-2 dust column concentrations with the most active and extensive natural dust sources. According to Figure 3, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentra- tion over the SAH region. Speciﬁcally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in May, June, and July, whereas low values in November, December, and January. A good correlation coefﬁcient (R = 0.91) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the SAH region with RMSE = 237.67 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust con- centrations for all months in Figure 3. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column con- centration in the SAH region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval with the maximum absolute difference in June (305.9 mg/m2) and the maximum relative difference in November (62.8%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in January (116.4 mg/m2), and the minimum relative difference is obtained in August (39.2%). The differences could be associated with the estimation of some meteorological parameters (such as precipitation [50] and wind speed [4]) in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system that makes signiﬁcant contributions to the magnitude of dust column concentration.

Figure 4. Same as Figure 3, but for Bodélé Depression (BOD) region. 3.1.3. Middle East The dust concentration over the Middle East (MIE) region also presents significant interannual variation. The differences in column dust concentration between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product over MIE are shown in Figure 5. On a regional means, the temporal variations represented by GRASP/Compo-nent dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product are in very good agreement. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in May, June, and July, whereas low values in November, December, and January. The statistics in the comparisons are also investi-gated for the regional dust column concentration. A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.90) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the MIE region with RMSE = 134.43 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is worth mentioning that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 5. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the MIE region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in August (209.7 mg/m2) and the relative difference in November (55.9%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in February (54.0 mg/m2) and the relative difference in May (18.0%). We should point out that the highest dust column concentration in the MIE region was retrieved in 2012 (Figure 5), which is consistent with the findings that the maximum values of AOD observed in 2012 over the MIE region using MODIS products during the period 2000 to 2015 [5]. The meteorological parameters of sea level pressure and wind speed representing the influences of synoptic systems on dust concentration make contributions to aerosol loading in the MIE region. The variation in dust column concentration in the Arabian Peninsula is intensely associ-ated with the Shamal winds, the magnitude of precipitation, the tropical Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea temperatures [51]. The accuracy of meteorological parameters estimation in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system could partly affect the differences.

3.1.2. Bodélé Depression
As one of the strongest dust emission sources [8], the Bodélé Depression (BOD) re- gion has the most interesting for the investigation of the discrepancies among differ- ent products. Figure 4 presents the differences in dust column concentration between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product over the BOD area. It is ev- ident that both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentration over the BOD region. Speciﬁcally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with extremely high values from March to June. A good correlation coefﬁcient (R = 0.88) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the BOD region with RMSE = 412.36 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust con- centrations for all months in Figure 4. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column con- centration in the BOD region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval with the maximum absolute difference in May (479.1 mg/m2) and a maximum rela- tive difference in November (67.7%). The absolute minimum difference of 302.2 mg/m2 was recorded in September, and the minimum relative difference was obtained in April (34.3%).

3.1.3. Middle East
The dust concentration over the Middle East (MIE) region also presents significant inter- annual variation. The differences in column dust concentration between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product over MIE are shown in Figure 5. On a regional means, the temporal variations represented by GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product are in very good agreement. Speciﬁcally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column con-


Figure 5. Same as Figure 3, but for Middle East (MIE) region. 3.1.4. Taklamakan Desert The comparison of the Taklamakan (TAK) desert in northwestern China is shown in Figure 6. We can see that the same variation in monthly means for the calculation of re-gional values is reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product pre-sent the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in April and May, whereas there are low values in November, December, and January. A correlation coeffi-cient of 0.80 is found between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the TAK region with RMSE = 122.30 mg/m2 (in Table 2). The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that over the TAK region, the dust column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component dust retrieval from May to December and February; however, it is lower for the months of January, March, and April. The maximum absolute differences of 144.7 mg/m2 and 141.7 mg/m2 are obtained in August and September, respectively, and the maximum relative difference is recorded in October (49.2%). The absolute minimum difference was obtained in January (−6.8 mg/m2 indicating MERRA-2 dust column con-centration is lower than GRASP/Component dust column concentration), and a minimum relative difference of 3.2% was recorded in February. Figure 6. Same as Figure 3, but for Taklamakan Desert (TAK) region.

The statistics in the comparisons are also investigated for the regional dust column concentration.

3.1.4. Taklamakan Desert
The comparison of the Taklamakan (TAK) desert in northwestern China is shown in Figure 6. We can see that the same variation in monthly means for the calculation of regional values is reﬂected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product. Speciﬁcally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in April and May, whereas there are low values in November, December, and January.

3.1.5. Gobi Desert The comparison of the Gobi Desert (GOB) region covering the northern part of China and the southern sector of Mongolia is shown in Figure 7. At a regional level, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the vari-ation in monthly dust column concentration over the GOB region. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in April and May, whereas low values in December and January. The correlation coefficient of 0.84 and RMSE = 74.36 mg/m2 are recorded between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the GOB region (Table 2). The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the GOB region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in June (113.0 mg/m2) and a maximum relative difference in October (52.1%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in January (13.1 mg/m2), and the minimum relative difference of 11.8% is recorded in April. Figure 7. Same as Figure 3, but for Gobi Desert (GOB) region. 3.1.6. Eastern Tropical Atlantic The accuracy of dust column concentration in downwind regions over the globe also needs to be examined. The intra-annual and interannual variations in dust column con-centration have distinctive cycles that are determined by the source or downwind region [52]. The dust particles over the tropical Atlantic Ocean are transported from the Sahara by tropical cyclones [53,54]. Dust particles originating from North Africa are also observed over the Caribbean Sea [42,55]. Therefore, we investigate the differences in dust column concentration over the Eastern Tropical Atlantic (ETA) region for these two products. Sim-ilar variations in monthly means for the calculation of regional values are reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product (Figure 8), with high values in June and July, whereas low values are in November and December. This behav-ior is consistent regardless of the differences observed, with a maximum absolute differ-ence in July (140.0 mg/m2) and a maximum relative difference in June and July (about 53%); the absolute minimum difference and relative differences are obtained in November (15.3 mg/m2 and 20.5%, respectively) (Table 3). A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.92) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the ETA region with RMSE = 86.79 mg/m2 (in Table 2). The differences could be partly at-tributed to the estimation of dust source emission intensity and their long-distance transport in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system.

Sub-Sahel The transatlantic transport of dust particles originating from Saharan and North Af-rica has been investigated by many studies [56,57]. For instance, during boreal winter, relatively high dust concentrations are observed over the Gulf of Guinea and across the northern regions (from Ghana to Cameroon) that are transported by the Harmattan from Saharan dust [52,58]. Therefore, we also selected the Sub-Sahel (SUS) region as a region of interest for the comparisons (Figure 9). As shown in Figure 9, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentration over the SUS region. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in February, March, and April, whereas low values in August. A good corre-lation coefficient (R = 0.89) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the SUS region with RMSE = 159.08 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentra-tions for all months in Figure 9. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the SUS region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in March (330.3 mg/m2) and the rel-ative difference in January (45.0%). The absolute minimum difference and relative differ-ence were recorded simultaneously in June (116.4 mg/m2, 39.2%, respectively). Figure 9. Same as Figure 3, but for Sub-Sahel (SUS) region. 3.1.8.

3.1.8. Mediterranean Basin
Aerosol loadings and types over the Mediterranean Basin (MED) region present interannual variations [6]. Mineral dust particles emitted from the Saharan and Middle Eastern deserts to the Mediterranean are demonstrated by the observations [6,49,52,59], which can be attributed to the nocturnal low-level jets, Harmattan surge, and Mediterranean depressions [60,61]. Figure 10 shows the comparison of dust column concentration between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the MED region. We can see that both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentration over the MED region. Speciﬁcally, in the MED region, high dust column concentrations are revealed by both GRASP/Component dust retrievals and MERRA-2 dust products in April and May, as well as low values recorded in November, December, and January. A good correlation coefﬁcient (R = 0.88) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the MED region with RMSE = 82.34 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 10. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the MED region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in April (131.5 mg/m2) and the maximum relative difference in March (60.0%). The absolute minimum difference was obtained in January (29.7 mg/m2), together with a minimum relative difference of 38.3% in February. The estimation of nocturnal low-level jets, Harmattan surge, and Mediterranean depressions in the model employed by MERRA-2 could make contributions to the differences.

Specifically, GRASP/Component dust re-trieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in June and July, whereas there are low values in November, December, and January. The statistics in the comparisons are also investigated for the regional dust column concentration (in Table 2). A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.98) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the ARA region with RMSE = 89.48 mg/m2. It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 11. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the ARA region throughout the

Specifically, GRASP/Component dust re-trieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in May, June, and July. However, low values are retrieved in November, December, and January from satellite observations, whereas low values are obtained in October, November, and December from the MERRA-2 dataset.

The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that over the BOB region, the dust column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component dust retrieval from February to May; however, lower concentration for other months (from June to January). The maximum absolute differences of −37.7 mg/m2 and −37.1 mg/m2 (negative values indicate MERRA-2 dust column concen-tration is lower than GRASP/Component dust column concentration) are obtained in Sep-tember and June, respectively, as well as the maximum relative difference of −177.8% (neg-ative values indicate MERRA-2 dust column concentration are lower than GRASP/Com-ponent dust column concentration) is obtained in December.

Similar variations in monthly means for the regional BC column concentration are re-flected by both GRASP/Component retrievals and MERRA-2 products over the SOA re-gion. Specifically, GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC products present the highest concentration in August and September, while the lowest concentration is in March and April. A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.94) and low RMSE = 0.77 mg/m2 are obtained between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the SOA region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the SOA region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval in all months except July, August, and September when the biomass burning is strong. The maximum absolute difference of 1.0 mg/m2 was obtained in October, and the maximum relative difference of 55.8% was obtained in December.

Figure 17 presents the comparisons of BC column concentration between GRASP/ Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product over the North China Plain (NCP) region. As shown in Figure 17, although both GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product can describe the variation in monthly BC column concentration over the NCP region, large discrepancies are found for all months except in June. The correlation coefﬁcient of R = 0.46 together with RMSE = 3.88 mg/m2 (in Table 4) is found between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the NCP region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the NCP region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval for all months. The absolute differences are larger than 3.5 mg/m2, and the relative difference is higher than 70%, except in June. It is noted that the absolute minimum difference and minimum relative difference (1.7 mg/m2 and 31.3%, respectively) are recorded simultaneously in June when GRASP/Component retrieval presents well the strongest BC emission associated with the biomass burning of agricultural activities in the NCP region. The signiﬁcant differences, to some extent, could be attributed to the emissions inventory assumption employed in models [30,31]. Specif- ically, anthropogenic BC emission in CEDS inventory does not describe the decreasing trend of BC in eastern China from 2006 to 2014 [30]. For instance, several anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the key regions of China have shown decreasing trends since 2006, such as anthropogenic black carbon (BC) emission has a statistically noteworthy trend of −1.4% per year in the Peking University (PKU) inventory. However, anthropogenic BC emission in Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) inventory shows an increasing trend of 2.7% over eastern China for the period 2006–2014, which is a complete reversal of the trend of PKU inventory. Therefore, the models that employ CEDS inventory cannot suc- cessfully capture the practical descending tendency [30]. Assimilated AOD observations in MERRA-2 cannot provide sufﬁcient information and constraints on the fractions or content

The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the NCP region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval for all months. The absolute differences are larger than 3.5 mg/m2, and the relative difference is higher than 70%, except in June. It is noted that the absolute minimum difference and minimum relative difference (1.7 mg/m2 and 31.3%, respectively) are recorded simultaneously in June when GRASP/Component retrieval presents well the strongest BC emission associated with the biomass burning of agricultural activities in the NCP region. The significant differences, to some extent, could be attributed to the emissions inventory assumption employed in models [30,31]. Specifi-cally, anthropogenic BC emission in CEDS inventory does not describe the decreasing trend of BC in eastern China from 2006 to 2014 [30]. For instance, several anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the key regions of China have shown decreasing trends since 2006, such as anthropogenic black carbon (BC) emission has a statistically noteworthy trend of −1.4% per year in the Peking University (PKU) inventory. However, anthropogenic BC emission in Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) inventory shows an increasing trend of 2.7% over eastern China for the period 2006–2014, which is a complete reversal of the trend of PKU inventory. Therefore, the models that employ CEDS inventory cannot successfully capture the practical descending tendency [30]. Assimilated AOD observa-tions in MERRA-2 cannot provide sufficient information and constraints on the fractions or content of aerosol species. In addition, the satellite-derived GRASP/Component BC products in China had been validated by in situ measurements with a mean absolute dif-ference of about 2.7 µm/m3, ranging from 0.09 to 7.8 µm/m3, and the relative difference of about 40%, ranging from 2.6% to 60%, respectively [41].

Northeast China and East Russia Figure 18 presents the comparisons of BC column concentration over Northeast China and east of Russia (NCR) region between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product. It is worth mentioning that both GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product can capture well the variation in monthly BC column concen-tration over the NCR region. Specifically, GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product presents the highest BC column concentration in April and May, whereas low values in the other months. The correlation coefficient of R = 0.68 together with RMSE = 0.75 mg/m2 (in Table 4) are found between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the NCR region, which could be attributed to small variabilities throughout the year. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the NCR region, the BC column concentration

In addition, the satellite-derived GRASP/Component BC products in China had been validated by in situ measurements with a mean absolute difference of about 2.7 µm/m3, ranging from 0.09 to 7.8 µm/m3, and the relative difference of about 40%, ranging from 2.6% to 60%, respectively [41].
of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval for all months except December. The maximum absolute difference and relative difference are obtained in July (1.1 mg/m2 and 67.4%, respectively), as well as the absolute minimum diﬀerence of −0.2 mg/m2 and minimum relative diﬀerence of −13.6% are also recorded simultaneously in December (negative values indicate MERRA-2 BC column concentration are lower than GRASP/Component BC column concentration).

Conclusions The aerosol assimilation system in MERRA-2 reanalysis data has been assessed and validated by many studies using the measurements of aerosol optical properties such as AOD over a regional or global scale.

Generally, the performed analysis conducted in the key regions of interest globally highlights the agreement between MERRA-2 and GRASP/Component for the mineral dust and black carbon column concentration products, although some differences can be observed with reasonable explanations. It is critical to understand the behavior of MERRA-2 reanalysis component estimation and component retrievals derived from sat-ellite observations. The GRASP/Component and MERRA-2 reanalysis products show consistent tem-poral variation in dust column concentration over the dust emission resource regions, with the correlation coefficient varying from 0.91 to 0.80. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust prod-ucts present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 40~70% over the African dust emission resource regions (SAH and BOD). However, over Asian dust emission resource regions (MIE, TAK, and GOB), the relative differences are mostly less than 40%, even for negative values in the TAK re-gion. Over the downwind dust-dominated regions, the similar temporal variations in dust column concentration are also reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products, with the correlation coefficient varying from 0.98 to 0.84. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 20~50% over the

4. Conclusions
The aerosol assimilation system in MERRA-2 reanalysis data has been assessed and validated by many studies using the measurements of aerosol optical properties such as AOD over a regional or global scale. However, the evaluation of MERRA-2 aerosol component products is still not conducted globally due to the scarcity of aerosol component measurements on extensive temporal and spatial scales. This study presents a quantita- tive evaluation of the MERRA-2 reanalysis dust and BC column concentration using the independent satellite-measured aerosol component concentration retrievals, which are not assimilated by the MERRA-2 reanalysis system. Several dust emission resource regions and the critical downwind dust-dominated regions are selected for the comparisons of mineral dust column concentration globally, as well as the conducted BC comparisons in some key regions of interest for strong BC emission.
Generally, the performed analysis conducted in the key regions of interest globally highlights the agreement between MERRA-2 and GRASP/Component for the mineral dust and black carbon column concentration products, although some differences can be observed with reasonable explanations. It is critical to understand the behavior of MERRA-2 reanalysis component estimation and component retrievals derived from satellite observations.
The GRASP/Component and MERRA-2 reanalysis products show consistent temporal variation in dust column concentration over the dust emission resource regions, with the correlation coefﬁcient varying from 0.91 to 0.80. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 40~70% over the African dust emission resource regions (SAH and BOD). However, over Asian dust emission resource regions (MIE, TAK, and GOB), the relative differences are mostly less than 40%, even for negative values in the TAK region. Over the downwind dust-dominated regions, the similar temporal variations in dust column concentration are also reﬂected by both GRASP/Component dust retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products, with the correlation coefﬁcient varying from 0.98 to 0.84. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 20~50% over the downwind dust-dominated regions except for the BOB region. Most of the relative differ- ences in the BOB region are negative and can even reach a value smaller than −150%.
Over the biomass burning and BC-affected areas in the globe, similar temporal varia- tions in BC column concentration are represented by both GRASP/Component BC retrievals and MERRA-2 BC products with a correlation coefﬁcient of about 0.70~0.90 except the NCP region. Higher column concentrations with relative differences of about 80% and lower column concentrations with relative differences of about −20% are presented by MERRA-2 reanalysis BC products compared to GRASP/Component BC retrievals
We should point out that the statistics for the comparisons of monthly regional aver- aged concentration could indicate that both MERRA-2 products and GRASP/Component retrievals can capture well the temporal variations in dust and BC column concentration with a high correlation coefﬁcient. Large differences and high correlation coefﬁcients could be obtained when systematic biases exist. For instance, a high correlation coefﬁ- cient and large RMSE are obtained for dust comparisons in SAH, BOD, and MIE. In this case, we should pay more caution with the regional applicability of MERRA-2 component products. Although the magnitudes of dust and BC column concentration described by GRASP/Component retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset present non-negligible dis- crepancies in some key regions, the results are helpful for the understanding of MERRA-2 reanalysis component products in a new view and demonstrate a practical application of the satellite-based component retrievals. With the development of an inversion algorithm and independent measurement data, the reasons for these differences are expected to be addressed in the near future.
