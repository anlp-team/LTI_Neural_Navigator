1 1.1
Introduction The PhD in Language and Information Technologies
The PhD in Language and Information Technologies (LTI PhD) is the doctoral degree offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. It is focused on understanding and extending the state of the art in computational linguistics, information retrieval, multimedia information retrieval, natural language processing, machine translation, speech processing, text mining, and other topics related to analysis of unstructured information (e.g., computational biology, machine learning, and software engineering of intelligent systems).
There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to the standard information outlined below. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the PhD in Language and Information Technologies.
While this handbook (and your college graduate student handbook) are specific to your academic experience in the department, there are several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook, the Office of the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, and others are included in Appendix A of this handbook.
All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies described in The Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook and at the University Policies website.

The Academic calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html and provides information on all deadlines, including registration dates, class start dates, add/drop deadlines, exam dates, and more. Doctoral course-sections follow a separate Academic Calendar.
1.5 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance
Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment, or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state, or local laws or executive orders.
Inquiries concerning the application of a compliance with this statement should be directed to the university ombudsperson, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 (412-268-1018).
Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling 412-268-2000.
Carnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report describing the university’s security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault, and fire safety policies, and containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years.

The Title IX coordinator may be reached at 412-268-7125 or tix@cmu.edu
1.6 The Carnegie Mellon Code
Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical, and moral conduct possible.
These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.
The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.
The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university. The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found here.

2.2 Photocopies and Printers
The use of a photocopier or printer requires you to log in with your CMU ID card. LTI’s printers are located in GHC 5404 and GHC 6604. The School of Computer Science provides a number of black-and-white and color printers for use by students. The SCS Computer SCS Computing Facilities publishes a list of printers online at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printer-list
2.3 Computers for LTI PhD Students
The computer resources for LTI PhD students are typically provided by their advisors.
PhD students will be given a CS user ID. A CS user ID is required to use the LTI computer cluster, department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science has a Help Center located at 4201. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu , extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line. (M-F, 9am-5pm)
PhD students will be given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or capstone projects. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.
3 Certification
PhD Degree Attainment - Standard Degree Requirements & Degree
3.1 Overview of LTI PhD Degree Requirements
In order to complete the PhD in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must satisfy the following requirements:
Pass at least 96 units of graduate level courses, with additional requirements detailed below
Satisfy proficiencies in Writing, Presentation, Programming, and Teaching • Propose, write, and defend a PhD dissertation (thesis)
The student must also attend the LTI Colloquium (11-700) each semester and satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement described elsewhere. Please note that there are no qualifying exams in the LTI PhD program.
LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook
Page 3


3.2 Course Requirements
In order to complete the course requirements for the PhD in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must pass 96 or more course units of graduate courses, and meet the following criteria:
at least 72 units of “LTI” courses and 24 units of “SCS” courses, • at least one class in each “LTI Focus Area”, and • at least two labs, in two different research areas.
For definitions of quoted terms, see the section on “Definitions of LTI Terminology”.
Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.
3.2.1 Grade Requirements
Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed study by satisfying the following grade requirements:
Minimum grade: Only courses with a grade of B (3.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree requirement.
Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement.
3.2.2 Proficiency Requirements
The LTI PhD does not require any Qualifying Exams.
However, an LTI PhD student is required to demonstrate proficiency in the following four areas:
Writing: This is satisfied by producing a peer-reviewed conference paper, or the equivalent (a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference-paper quality). • Presentation: This is satisfied by the oral presentation of a conference paper, or the equivalent (an oral presentation that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference- talk quality).
Programming: This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming of language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research and/or project work.
Teaching: This is satisfied by two (2) successful Teaching Assistantships (TA-ships), as determined by the faculty member for whom the student serves as TA. Typically, one of these will be for an undergraduate class, and one for a graduate-level class. Also, one of the two TA-ships may be in some form of pre-approved "alternate service", such as an SCS “v- unit.” The Program Coordinator must be notified in advance of a TA-ship, or it may not be accepted. Students who are not native speakers of English are required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990 to pass the CMU ITA test prior to TA-ing. The
LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook
Page 4


fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns, will be rated by Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA.
The full university policy can be reviewed at: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation- certification-english-fluency-instructors.html . The fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA.
In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory screening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the SASC helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the Student Academic Success Center website for more information.
3.2.3 The PhD Dissertation
The PhD dissertation is the defining feature of a PhD degree. The process has three main milestones:
Thesis Topic: During the PhD student’s third year, the student should be working hard to find a thesis topic. The thesis topic typically develops from the directed research that the student has been carrying out with the student’s advisor. The topic is a well-defined research problem that is interesting and unsolved, and for which the student has a believable proposed solution. When the dissertation is finished, there will be a “thesis statement” that describes the claimed solution to the research problem that is the thesis topic.
Thesis Proposal: Near the end of the student’s third year, the student will compose a dissertation proposal. In this document, the student will specify the problem the research addresses (the thesis topic); the significance of the problem and expected scientific contributions; other relevant research, including competing approaches; some preliminary results; the work that still must be completed; evaluation metrics for that work; and a projected timeline for completion. Before presenting the proposal, the student will also secure approval for a dissertation committee, which consists of the student’s advisor, at least two other SCS faculty members working in language technologies, and at least one external member. University rules require that the time and place of the proposal presentation be publicly announced at least one week before the presentation. The student should coordinate this with the PhD Program Coordinator. The public thesis proposal protects the student by guaranteeing that the proposed research is interesting to the larger scientific community and demonstrating that the student will finish the program if the work is completed as outlined.
Thesis Defense: The dissertation document itself, normally expected at the end of the fifth year, will include a detailed description of all the work done, including a clear evaluation and a discussion of its scientific contributions. There are no fixed style or document length guidelines or requirements; the only format requirement is that the title page should be
LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook
Page 5


suitable to be issued as an LTI Technical Report. The dissertation defense is a public presentation and defense of the dissertation results. Note: University rules again require that the time and place of the dissertation defense be publicly announced at least one week prior to the defense. This should also be coordinated with PhD Program Coordinator.
NOTE: At the time of the public announcement, a draft of the thesis document must be made available online.
3.2.4 Research Speaking Requirement
To emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills and increase internal awareness of LTI work, all LTI PhD students must complete an oral presentation at the LTI each year (by the end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20-minute talk plus time for discussion. It must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the public will be invited. (The thesis proposal and defense each count towards this requirement.)
At least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor. After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery.
3.2.5 Withdrawal of a Degree
The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html
3.3 Advising
Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed study projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.
How and when the advisor is selected: the Matching Process: Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (“Immigration Course”, or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a first, second and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a "Marriage Committee" to determine the best set of matches.
LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook
Page 6


Until a student finds a specific advisor, the PhD Program Director serves as the advisor.
How to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem (assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time.
3.4 Process for completing a Master’s Degree enroute to a PhD
The LTI always allows our PhD students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master’s degree to receive the master’s degree without any additional work. Please see the MLT Handbook since the requirements for the MLT coursework are a bit more detailed.
3.5 Definitions of LTI Terminology
We define here some of the terms as used in this handbook:
An “LTI course” is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with 11-XXX counts as one-half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that we will allow any one MLD (10-XXX) graduate course to count as an "LTI course".
An “SCS course” is any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6-unit course with such a number counts as one-half of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended electives that are technically outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Digital Signal Processing in ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as “SCS.”
“LTI Focus Areas” are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under “Course Categories.” If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should notify the PhD Program Director. They will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area, and if approved it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage.
A “Task-Orientation Focus Course” is simply a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on the “Course Categories” webpage.
An LTI “lab course” is simply a course in the list of lab courses defined in the LTI “Course Categories” webpage.
LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook
Page 7


3.6 Recommended Electives outside of SCS
Students are free to take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross-registered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requirements of their program as described above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor; typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses.
Note: recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the “SCS” course requirement. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as “SCS.
Note also that students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., summer courses). The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (“B” is the minimum for PhD, “C” for MLT).
3.7 LTI Orientation (“The Immigration Course” or “The IC”)
At the beginning of each Fall semester, the LTI provides 2-3 weeks of lectures and talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and treat them as seriously as a course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however, the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.
For many years, these talks were called "the Immigration Course (IC)." The intuition behind this name is that the talks help orient newly-arrived students – immigrants into the CMU environment. As a result, some students understood the name to indicate that the talks would be about US immigration and visa requirements. The older name has been retired; however, people who have been at CMU a long time may occasionally use the older name.
3.8 End of Semester Evaluation
Near the end of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes his or her achievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester.
At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degree.
A good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual.
LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook
Page 8


If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent "black mark" on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.
In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.
3.9 Enrollment Verification
Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required.
For more information, please see CMU’s:
Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and EVerify Requirements at CMU (pdf), • or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9.
3.10 Withdrawal of a Degree
The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html
3.11 University Policies on Grades and Grading
3.11.1 University Policy on Grades
Grading - University Policies - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu)
This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.
Process for Appealing Final Grades
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit, or program.
LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook
Page 9


Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university policy.

3.11.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses
Transfer Credit Evaluation and Assignment - University Policies - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu)
Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows:
Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be considered for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations.
(Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this.)
3.12 Academic Integrity
In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.
Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society.
Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society; to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem- solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a
LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook

diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.
In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.
Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html)
The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures is also recommended.
Important note: The LTI implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.” Our procedure is as follows: a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide not to immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation.
If the student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.
These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process. Please see http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/documents/academic-disciplinary-actions- overview-for-graduate-students.2013.pdf
Appeals of Course-Level Action - The Word - Student Handbook - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu) for more information.
3.13 Employment Eligibility Verification
Students who are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment).
Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf] covering the university’s I-9 and E-Verify requirements: • Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment. Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required.

For more information, please see CMU’s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify

Academic Policies
4.1 PhD Academic Policies
4.1.1 Duration of Study
The target duration of the LTI PhD is five years. Doctoral students who require an extended period to complete their degree requirements must consult with their academic program, and are subject to the CMU Policy on Doctoral Student Status (www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student-life/doctoral-student-status.html), specifically the “Time to Degree” section. See also the “Statute of Limitations” policy.
4.1.2 Double-Dipping
An LTI PhD student who uses courses taken as a master’s student (here at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other master’s degree offered by the school. The LTI (like other SCS units) always allows our PhD students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master’s degree to receive the master’s degree without any additional work. Any other sharing of coursework by an LTI student between more than one CMU degree (e.g., receiving an MLD Master’s degree that includes courses taken as an LTI PhD student) must be explicitly approved by the LTI, on a case-by-case basis, in advance.
4.1.3 ABD versus ABD in Absentia (ABS)
Following university policy, an LTI PhD student is considered "All-But-Dissertation" (ABD) when they have completed all requirements for the LTI's PhD degree except for the thesis defense (in particular, the student has had a thesis proposal accepted). Note that ABD status is different from ABD in absentia (ABS) status. A student in ABS status cannot receive any support from the university (including any research projects within the university), cannot use most university facilities, and does not pay any tuition until they are ready to defend their thesis. ABS students must register for five (5) units of dissertation research in the semester they defend; in keeping with university policy, the LTI (and its projects and faculty) cannot pay for these five units. The student can (and should) register for these five units only after they defend; just in case the defense date slips to the next semester.
4.1.4 University Policy for Doctoral Student Status
This policy sets forth a definition of All But Dissertation (ABD) status, time limits on doctoral candidacy status, a definition of being In Residence and In Absentia for candidates and the tuition and fees charged for candidates in each status. The ABD Status Agreement Form
LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook
Page 12


4.1.5 External Internships
The LTI guarantees summer support for its PhD students, so we expect them to work on research at Carnegie Mellon during the summer. Because we recognize that outside experience can be a valuable educational experience, we do allow PhD students to accept a minimum of one external internship during their PhD studies, provided they are in good standing. Because some students can benefit from more than one internship, especially if they require access to proprietary data for their work, with the approval of the student’s advisor they can intern 3-4 times during their PhD degree program. Interning more than 4 times requires approval from the PhD Program Director.
Any internship must be planned in consultation with the student’s advisor and the LTI PhD Graduate Coordinator. If an internship is part of a fully- funded external fellowship (e.g., Microsoft Research Fellowship), the student does not need prior LTI approval, but should still coordinate with their advisor. International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract.
Internships are typically scheduled during the summer. In certain cases, it is possible to schedule an internship during the fall or spring semester; the details are complex, especially for international students, so the student should discuss this as early as possible with the Program Director of LTI Graduate Programs. International students must coordinate carefully with the LTI in any event, due to visa restrictions.
Note that self-funded PhD students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester internship) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while full-time LTI-sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend.
We caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas.
If the experience will have units attached to it the program should have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units, they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc.
4.1.6 Maximum Courseload
In order to encourage PhD students to focus on research, PhD students are permitted to register for 54 units of actual coursework per semester.
4.1.7 Pass/Fail Grades
Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement.
Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.
LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook
Page 13


4.1.8 Transfer Credit
An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the PhD course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the PhD Program Director.
Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student’s transcript to make the decision.
See the section on “Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption.”
4.1.9 Residency Requirements
The university requires PhDs to spend at least one year of residency at Carnegie Mellon.
The SCS requires that all PhD students must take at Carnegie Mellon a minimum of 36 units of the total coursework required by their respective programs.
4.1.10 Transferring Into the PhD Program
The LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master’s programs into its PhD program. The student must apply for the PhD at the usual time. However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities.
4.1.11 Transferring Out of the PhD Program
The PhD program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. A student who is interested in transferring out of the PhD degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.
4.1.12 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures
Add, drop, withdrawal and pass/no pass election deadlines may be found on the official Doctoral course-sections Academic Calendar.
Doctoral students, visiting/non-degree students, and certificate students do not receive vouchers and do not participate in the voucher process.
4.1.13 Statute of Limitations: Time to Degree
As outlined in the Doctoral Student Status Policy, students will complete all requirements for the PhD degree within a maximum of ten years from original matriculation as a doctoral student, or less if required by a more restrictive department or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a doctoral degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered doctoral degree program under criteria determined by that program.
LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook
Page 14


Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students, who are pursuing the PhD degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department’s recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption.
Students, who are pursuing the PhD degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.
4.2 LTI Academic Policies
4.2.1 “Grandfather” policy
A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.
4.2.2 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption
The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program.
If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective.
The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place.
If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.
4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting
Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to work primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most
LTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook
Page 15


one day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE); otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status. See also External Internships.
4.2.4 Leave of Absence
The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.
Students taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university’s leave of absence process, which is described at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/leaves-and- returns/index.html
4.2.5 Satisfactory Progress
If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on “End of Semester Evaluation.”
4.2.6 Winter and Summer Breaks
Students supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is typically allowed in the summer.
The normal winter break policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks and takes vacation for the other two weeks.
4.3 CMU Academic Policies
4.3.1 University Financial Aid
Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website: https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html. Students will find the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links.
International Students” Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than- standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.

4.3.3 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures
https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html
Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program.
4.3.4 Safeguarding Educational Equity: Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault
The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence, and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith.
The University’s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual-misconduct/index.html
The University’s Policy Against Retaliation is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html

4.3.5 Childbirth/Maternity Accommodation Protocol
https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of the semester may consider taking time away from their coursework and/or research responsibilities. All female students who give birth to a child while engaged in coursework or research are eligible to take either a short-term absence or formal leave of absence. Students are encouraged to consult with relevant university faculty and staff as soon as possible as they begin making plans regarding time away.
Students in course work should consider either working with their course instructor to receive incomplete grades or elect to drop to part-time status or to take a semester leave of absence.
Students engaged in research must work with their faculty to develop plans for the research for the time they are away.
Students must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations. Students will complete an information form and meet with a member of the Dean’s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student.
Planning for the student’s discussion with her academic contact(s) (advisor, associate dean, etc.) may be reviewed during this meeting.
Doctoral students who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) weeks during a Short-Term Maternity Accommodation or a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks if an absence longer than six weeks is medically necessary. To receive this support students must be registered with the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs for maternity accommodation. 4.3.6 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate Students
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html This policy addresses romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.

subject to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition and fees, and a monthly PhD stipend that is fixed across SCS. In addition, the LTI pays a dependency allowance of 10% of the student's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless they have a spouse who earns more than $200 per month.
The impact of outside fellowships and scholarships on departmental support-decrease by amount, added bonus, etc.
See also the section on “ABD versus ABD in Absentia (ABS).”
If a PhD student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is expected to accept it in place of the LTI’s graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, the LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined stipend 10 percent higher than that of the standard LTI graduate fellowship.
Students are required to inform the LTI about any external funding that they receive.
5.2 Conference Travel Funding
Students funded by research projects receive travel funding according to policies set by the individual projects. Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding, with a larger amount available for travel to present a refereed conference paper. There is an LTI form that must be filled out in advance.
5.3 Research Funding
GuSH Research Funding is a source of small research grant funds provided by the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) and the Provost’s Office and managed by the Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs. Students can find more information about the application process and deadlines at: https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/professional-development/research-funding/index.html
5.4 Office of the Dean of Students Emergency Support Funding
