The tennis courts are centrally located in the heart of Carnegie Mellon's campus and were renovated in 2005 and last resurfaced in 2020. They consist of six wind-protected, hard courts and are available for use by Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff and students.

A video scoreboard was installed ahead of the 2015 fall season with video cameras on each court for live broadcasting installed in the summer of 2016.
