#SCS25

After 25 years, we have a lot to celebrate. Including you!

We're marking the silver anniversary of the founding of the School of Computer Science with a series of special events, both on Carnegie Mellon University's campus in Pittsburgh, and around the world.

We're looking back on 25 years of SCS (as well as more than a half century of computer science at Carnegie Mellon), and forward to what the future holds in areas such as big data, personal computing, communications, digital entertainment, information security, robotics, artificial intelligence and embedded systems.
