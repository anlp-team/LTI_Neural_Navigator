The Club will pursue targeted strategies to develop and enhance alumni relations, fundraising, development and other initiatives as determined by the Club board and as approved by the University Administration.

Goals: The goals of the Club are as follows:

To support the athletics department’s fundraising initiatives, including, but not limited to, annual giving to the Tartan Funds, and major gifts for capital projects.

To regularly engage athletics alumni, both on and off campus.

To communicate major athletics department and Club initiatives to university stakeholders.

To provide advice and counsel to the athletics department administration.

To raise awareness of athletics programs to students, alumni and the community at-large.

Other goals as set by the Tartan Athletics Club board.

In order to join the Tartan Athletics Club, individuals must make a contribution to the Tartan Fund. Membership will provide regular communication from the department via e-mail and e-newsletters along with invitations to special events associated with athletics contests throughout the year.
