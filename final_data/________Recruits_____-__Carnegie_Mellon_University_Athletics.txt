For those applying to join the Fall 2021 first-year class and beyond, SAT Subject Tests are neither required nor recommended, and these scores wonâ€™t be considered in our admission review process. *Carnegie Mellon University has adopted a test-optional policy for one year, removing the SAT/ACT standardized testing requirement for first-year Fall 2021 applicants.
