ABSTRACT
Language Models (LMs) achieve substantial language capabilities when finetuned using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is an unstable and data-hungry process that continually requires new high-quality LM-generated data for finetuning. We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-LOL), a new class of offline policy gradient algorithms that enable RL training on any pre-existing data. By assuming the entire LM output sequence as a single action, A-LOL allows incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using LM’s internal sequence-level value estimate, A-LOL filters negative advantage (low-quality) data points during training, making it resilient to noise. Overall, A-LOL is an easy-to-implement LM training recipe that is sample-efficient and stable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-LOL and its variants with a set of four different language generation tasks. We compare against both online RL (PPO) and recent preference-based (DPO, PRO) and reward-based (GOLD) offline RL baselines. On the commonly-used RLHF benchmark, Helpful and Harmless As- sistant (HHA), LMs trained with A-LOL methods achieve the highest diversity while also being rated more safe and helpful than baselines according to humans. Additionally, in the remaining three tasks, A-LOL could optimize multiple distinct reward functions even when using noisy or suboptimal training data.

INTRODUCTION
Pretrained (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020) and/or instruction-tuned (Wei et al., 2022a; Chung et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b) large Language Models (LMs) show huge improvements in quality and safety when finetuned with Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023b). However, the most popular RLHF method, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), is sensitive to hyperparameters and suffers from training instability (Yuan et al., 2023; Casper et al., 2023). More importantly, PPO periodically requires new batches of LM-generated data for each training step which leads to additional computational overhead and risk of distribution/mode collapse (Song et al., 2023b; Shumailov et al., 2023; Go et al., 2023). Given these limitations, we ask: Can we perform rewarded learning, similar to PPO, while only using pre-existing data? We propose Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-LOL), a set of sample-efficient and stable learning algorithms that uses Offline Policy Gradients (Degris et al., 2012; Weng, 2018) to optimize LMs towards any desired rewards using only pre-collected language data. Notably in A-LOL, we assume the entire output sequence as a single action step, which allows it to calculate training data advantage and filter unfavorable instances. The advantage is the reference LM’s value estimate subtracted from the reward, which determines the benefit of each training instance toward the learning process. Subsequently, discarding the data points with negative advantages improves the learning efficiency of A-LOL and makes it robust to noisy data.
A-LOL is very easy to implement over standard cross entropy loss using two key improvements: (1) sequence-level advantage and (2) importance weight (used to discourage big divergence of target LM’s distribution from the initial reference LM). As illustrated in Table 1, our method only requires a sequence-level reward with single output for every data point, in contrast to recent preference-based

(Rafailov et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023a) offline RL methods that require human-labeled pairwise comparisons. Importantly, A-LOL and its variants share most similarities with PPO, while greatly simplifying the training and also enabling offline learning.
Through a series of four different language generation tasks, each using one or more classifiers to calculate the reward, we show that A-LOL consistently outperforms the baselines while using the least amount of training data. We first experiment with the RLHF benchmark task, Helpful and Harmless Assistant (HHA) (Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022) (§4), where both human-labeled preference data and reward model are available. We systematically compare all offline RL algorithms using the same 7B base model architecture and show training stability trends over multiple random seeds. We find that A-LOL variants achieve comparable average reward to DPO while offering more stable learning, lower variance, and higher response diversity than every other baseline. In a more qualitative evaluation, humans judge the A-LOL models to be the most helpful and safe. In another single-reward experiment with the Commonsense Reasoning task (West et al., 2022) (Appendix §C.1), A-LOL again showed the highest improvement in quality and diversity among the baselines.
We also demonstrate A-LOL’s flexibility to utilize multiple rewards in RL training, which contrasts with preference-based methods that can only support unidimensional preferences. In particular, we experiment with two multi-reward dialog tasks, Reddit response generation (§5), and Faithful knowledge-grounded dialog (Dinan et al., 2019) (Appendix §C.2). In both tasks, A-LOL was able to simultaneously optimize four or more different reward functions that improved fluency, safety, diversity, and other qualitative attributes of the LMs, even in the presence of noisy training data. Our findings demonstrate that A-LOL is a robust, stable, sample-efficient offline RL method for language learning that can be easily substituted with cross-entropy loss in tasks where real-value rewards are available. We release the code at https://github.com/abaheti95/LoL-RL.
2 ADVANTAGE-LEFTOVER LUNCH RL
Before introducing our main method, we first briefly explain how we frame language generation tasks as an RL game with the single-action assumption (§2.1). We then derive the main learning objective of A-LOL using offline policy gradient (§2.2). To better contextualize A-LOL, we also discuss its relationship with log-likelihood loss, weighted Behavior Cloning (Wang et al., 2020) (§2.3) and a another offline policy gradient algorithm GOLD (Pang & He, 2021) (§2.4).2
1We do not compare with other online RL (Shi et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023) that are very similar to PPO and preference-based method (Zhao et al., 2023) similar to DPO. We also avoid comparing with offline RL methods that require additional data manipulation (Lu et al., 2022; Welleck et al., 2022; Jang et al., 2022; Verma et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2022; Cho et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023) and model architecture changes (Kim et al., 2022; Snell et al., 2023).
2We also discuss A-LOL’s connection with PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) in Appendix §A.

Figure 1: Illustration of Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL in practice. We first supervised finetune the reference policy (πref) on the training data as a precursor to A-LOL training. Then, an external reward model is employed to train the value estimate layer (Vπref ) on frozen πref. Subsequently, using the reference policy values on Dtr, we can find instances with positive advantage. A-LOL then multiplies the positive advantage and importance weight with negative log likelihood to train target LM (πθ). Evaluation on Dtest shows LM trained with A-LOL achieves higher average reward and better distribution compared to the reference policy.
2.1 LANGUAGE TASKS AS RL WITH SINGLE ACTION EPISODES
We consider language generation as a sequence-to-sequence task containing training Dtr and valida- tion Dv sets with pairs of input x and output y sequences. Contrasting with previous RL methods that consider each token in y as a separate action (Pang & He, 2021; Kim et al., 2022; Snell et al., 2023; Ramamurthy et al., 2023), we consider the entire y as a single action from the LM agent, after which the agent receives the task-specific sequence-level reward R(x, y, ⋆) and the episode ends. The single-action assumption allows incorporating any pretrained attribute-specific classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as a reward during offline finetuning. When multiple scoring functions are available, we set the reward to the sum of all the functions.
2.2 OFFLINE POLICY GRADIENT TO ADVANTAGE LOL RL
To derive our main learning equation, we start with the Offline Policy Gradient objective (Degris et al., 2012; Weng, 2018). Let πref be the reference policy LM trained on Dtr with standard negative likelihood loss (NLL) and πθ be the target policy we want to optimize, which is initially identical to πref. Both πref and πθ take the input sequence x (state) and generate an output sequence y (action). Using the single action episode assumption, we can write the stationary distribution of reference policy as dπref (x) = P (x|πref) = P (x), where x belongs to the set of all input sequences X . We can then optimize target policy πθ on this stationary distribution dπref with the following objective: dπref(x)
(cid:88)
(cid:88)
J(θ) = max
R(x, y, ⋆)πθ(y|x)
θ
x∈X
y∈Y
where Y is the set of all outputs. Taking a derivative of the above equation with respect to θ yields: R(x, y, ⋆)πθ(y|x)] = Ex∼dπref [
(cid:88)
(cid:88)
∇θJ(θ) = ∇θEx∼dπref [
R(x, y, ⋆)∇θπθ(y|x)]
y∈Y
y∈Y
We then multiply and divide by πθ(y|x) and πref(y|x) and further simplify the equation as follows,
∇θJ(θ) = Ex∼dπref ,y∼πref[R(x, y, ⋆) (cid:125)
(cid:124)
(cid:123)(cid:122) reward
πθ(y|x) πref(y|x) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) (cid:124) importance weight
] ∇θ ln πθ(y|x) (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:124) NLL
Here, the importance weight3 is the ratio of sequence-level probability of y between πθ and πref, which results into a single scalar factor. Observe that the inputs of Dtr are a subset of the dπref, i.e. all possible texts in the language generation task X . Also, the ground truth outputs in Dtr are the outputs πref is trained to imitate. Using these observations, we update the expectation in the previous equation and obtain the Reward LOL RL objective (with a negative sign to show minimization): ∇θJR-LOL(θ) = −EDtr [R(x, y, ⋆) · r(θ, ref) · ∇θ ln πθ(y|x)]

where r(θ, ref) = πθ(y|x)
πref(y|x) is the shorthand for importance weight.
For boosting learning efficiency, we can replace R(x, y, ⋆) in equation 4 with advantage, defined as Aπθ (x, y, R) = R(x, y, ⋆) − Vπθ (x), i.e., the policy’s estimate of expected reward for the input subtracted from the actual reward of the training data (Schulman et al., 2016). However, maintaining the most recent value estimate of πθ is difficult, as it is constantly updated during training. Therefore, we swap the reward in equation 4 with the advantage of the frozen reference policy, Aπref(x, y, R) = R(x, y, ⋆) − Vπref(x). We call this the Advantage LOL RL objective.
∇θJA-LOL(θ) = −EDtr [Aπref(x, y, R) · r(θ, ref) · ∇θ ln πθ(y|x)]
To compute πref’s value estimate, we initialize a small network of multi-head attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) and a single-layer MLP on top of frozen parameters of πref. This value estimate module takes the last hidden layer representation of πref(x) and predicts expected future reward Vπref(x). We cheaply train this value estimate on the rewards achieved by πref on the validation set (Dv) with mean squared error loss. We then calculate the Aπref(x, y, R) for all instances in Dtr. Figure 1 illustrates an example of how A-LOL improves the distribution of test rewards by using the value estimate of the reference policy. Next, we describe several other variants of A-LOL algorithm.
Variants with alternative Importance Weight Exploiting the flexibility offered by importance weight in A-LOL, we experiment with three alternatives. First, we create A-LOL (ref. free) by setting the importance weight to 1. In the second variant, we convert the full-sequence importance weight in A-LOL (equation 5) to a per-token importance weight. Specifically, we propose an approximate importance weight multiplied with log-likelihood using the probability chain rule as follows, πθ(y|x) πref(yi|x,y<i) ∇θ ln πθ(yi|x, y<i)], where yi is the ith token in y and y<i are the preceding tokens. We name this variant A-LOL sequence. Finally, inspired by PPO’s ablations (Schulman et al., 2017), we experiment with replacing the importance weight with a weighted KL penalty to obtain A-LOL KL:
πref(y|x) ∇θ ln πθ(y|x) ≈ (cid:80)|y|
i=1[ πθ(yi|x,y<i)
∇θJA-LOL KL(θ) = −EDtr
(cid:20) Aπref (x, y, R) · ∇θ ln πθ(y|x) − β · ∇θ
ln πθ(y|x) ln πref(y|x)
(cid:21)
We propose two more modifications in A-LOL training to improve its stability and efficiency.
Clipping Importance Weight Direct usage of A-LOL objective (Equation 5) in training is unstable as loss values can fluctuate hugely depending on the importance weight r(θ, ref). To mitigate this issue, we clip the importance weight as clip(r(θ, ref), 1 − ϵ, 1 + ϵ) (Schulman et al., 2017). This clip operator discourages big changes from reference policy. In A-LOL sequence, we apply the clip operator separately to the importance weight of every token in the output.
Reward/Advantage Priority Sampling In all the experiments, we find that a non-trivial amount of data points in Dtr obtain a negative advantage (Aπref < 0). We discard these data points as they may not help in generalizing beyond πref. To boost the training efficiency of A-LOL even more, we employ positive advantage-based weighted sampling of train instances (similar to Welleck et al., 2022). We present the full pseudo code for A-LOL in Algorithm 1. For reward-based offline RL methods, we similarly employ reward-based priority sampling in all the experiments.
Overall, A-LOL and its variants are efficient and easy to implement on top of standard negative log-likelihood as it only involves multiplying two factors: advantage/reward, and importance weight. Furthermore, the positive-advantage priority sampling makes A-LOL’s training very efficient, some- times reaching close to peak generalization with only 30% additional steps (see Figure 2).
2.3 RELATIONSHIP WITH NLL AND WEIGHTED BEHAVIOR CLONING
We draw connections between Reward LOL RL and other learning methods. If we set both R(x, y, ⋆) = 1 and r(θ, ref) = 1 in the equation 4, it reduces to negative log-likelihood objec- tive. This implies that maximum likelihood learning is a subset of R-LOL’s objective. By carefully adjusting the R(x, y, ⋆) term while keeping r(θ, ref) = 1, both data filtering (West et al., 2022) and weighted behavior cloning4 (Wang et al., 2020) can also be viewed as subsets of our method.
4Weighted behavior cloning simply multiplies the NLL objective with the reward R(x, y, ⋆).

2.4 COMPARISON WITH GOLD
Previously, Pang & He (2021) developed the GOLD algorithm using a similar offline policy gradient derivation, but without the single-action approximation. Compared to R-LOL objective (equation 4), GOLD objective has two peculiar differences: (1) it approximates reference policy probability as constant in the importance weight, and (2) it uses reference policy’s per-token log-probability as token-level reward. Intuitively, this method “encourages the learning algorithm to focus on easy examples (high likelihood under the model)” (Pang & He, 2021). However, it cannot trivially include arbitrary sparse-reward like R-LOL. For comparison, we use the single-action assumption and replace the per-token reward with a sequence-level reward to get the Reward GOLD objective, −EDtr [R(x, y, ⋆)πθ(y|x)∇θ ln πθ(y|x)], where we approximate the importance weight and NLL as (cid:80)|y|
i=1 max(πθ(yi|x, y<i), u)∇θ ln πθ(yi|x, y<i) with lower bound u for stability.
3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND BASELINES
We conduct experiments with four different language generation tasks: two single-reward tasks (Helpful and Harmless Assistant, Section §4 and Commonsense Reasoning, Appendix §C.1) and two multiple-rewards tasks (Reddit response generation, Section §5 and Knowledge Grounded Dialog, Appendix §C.2). In each experiment, we use a separate reference LM which is the starting point for all learning methods and we continue further finetuning for a roughly equal number of steps (depending on the Dtr size). Overall, we compare A-LOL and its modified importance weight variants (A-LOL (ref. free), A-LOL seq., and A-LOL KL) against negative log-likelihood (NLL) and the following offline RL baselines:
Preference-based Baselines We experiment with three offline RL algorithms that directly use the human-labeled preference data to solve the RLHF task. DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) converts the constrained reward optimization into a preference classification loss by defining a surrogate reward as the ratio of target policy and reference policy log probabilities. Subsequent work introduced PRO (Song et al., 2023a) that extends DPO’s classification loss into a ranking loss and interpolates it with the negative log-likelihood for stability. For ablation purposes, we also test DPO (ref. free), a variant of DPO without the reference policy log probabilities. We cannot test with preference-based methods in tasks with multiple rewards or where human-labeled preferences are not available.
Reward-based Baselines We also compare with R-LOL (Equation 4) and other related reward- based offline RL methods: wBC (§2.3) and Reward GOLD (§2.4).
4 HHA: HELPFUL AND HARMLESS ASSISTANT TASK
Our main experiment uses the Helpful and Harmless assistant dataset (Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022) containing 170K instances of user-assistant conversations that end with a pair of model- generated responses. The final responses are labeled good and bad respectively to indicate human preference labels. The dataset comprises four subsets: Harmlessbase containing red-teaming conversa- tions which attempt to illicit harmful responses, while the other three, Helpfulbase, Helpfulonline, and Helpfulrejection, contain advice and assistance seeking conversations. We reuse the data splits from

Song et al. (2023a) with minor data cleaning.5 In total, this task has 143K train, 280 validation, and 8.2K test conversations and their human preference labeled responses.
Reference LM, Reward model and Training We choose LLaMA-7B base architecture (Touvron et al., 2023a) with QLoRA adapter (Dettmers et al., 2023) pretrained on HHA dataset6 as the reference policy. We also test PPO7 in this experiment, along with the aforementioned offline RL baselines and A-LOL variants. In total, we executed 36 different training runs for 12 learning methods, each with three random seeds. For all algorithms using rewards, we employ a 1.4B parameter classifier8 trained on human preference labels as the reward model.
While preference-based RL methods use all training paired comparisons, other methods only use the good subset responses during training. In fact, A-LOL methods are most data efficient, by ignoring ≈ 33% of good responses that were identified as negative advantage. We roughly allocate one epoch of training steps for every offline RL method, depending on their training data requirements. We train PPO for 1.3× the training steps of offline methods (excluding the computation cost of generating online data). Finally, as a benchmark, we also evaluate an external 6B model trained with PPO on the HHA dataset.9 We present the implementation details of all tested methods in Appendix B.1.
4.1 HHA RESULTS
Stability Comparison of Offline RL algorithms Figure 2 shows the trajectories of validation reward achieved by all offline RL methods averaged across three random seeds. The left plot shows that preference-based methods, especially DPO and DPO (ref. free), suffer from high variance across random seeds when compared with NLL training. In contrast, the reward-based methods have comparable or even lower variance than NLL (middle). In the right plot, we observe that A-LOL methods also show similar stability as reward-based methods, while achieving higher rewards.
Among our advantage-based methods, A-LOL (ref. free) achieves lower validation performance than other variants. A-LOL KL, on the other hand, can become unstable by minimizing the KL penalty term instead of policy-gradient loss, as evidenced by a drop in performance towards the end of training. Comparatively, A-LOL and A-LOL seq. steadily improve throughout the training.
We also separately plot the three trajectories of PPO in Appendix Figure 3 and notice one of the seeds shows performance deterioration and mode-collapse (Shumailov et al., 2023; Go et al., 2023).
Automatic Evaluation and Analysis We employ a larger 6.5B parameter reward model10 to evaluate the best checkpoints from each run on the test set. We also compare the response distribution using average length and diversity measures (Distinct-1, 2, and 3), which are calculated as the ratio of unique unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams (Li et al., 2016). The average evaluation metrics obtained by each method across three random seeds are reported in Table 2. In the first three rows, we establish the test set good and bad responses and the reference policy (πref) performance.

For comparison, we also report the performance of Test responses and reference policy (πref) in the first three rows, along with another external PPO model* in the last row. Overall, the best A-LOL methods achieve comparable rewards to DPO, while approaching the distribution of Test good responses in terms of length and diversity. Oddly, DPO and DPO (ref. free) tend to generate longer and less diverse responses while PPO generates the shortest.

Overall, A-LOL and its variants consistently achieve high average reward with relatively low variance, even after discarding ≈33% of training data points. Further qualitative analysis reveals that the lowest negative advantage instances often indicate bad quality data (Appendix B.4). A-LOL methods perform comparably to DPO and outperform all other preference-based and reward-based baselines while generating the most diverse responses. Interestingly, A-LOL seq. (that uses a per-token importance weight) achieves the best diversity among all models, aligning its distribution most closely with test responses.11 For preference-based baselines, we notice a direct correlation between high variance of validation performance (Fig. 2 left) and high variance of test set average reward and response length. Despite its high average reward, DPO (and DPO ref. free) tends to skew the response distribution to unusually long and less diverse responses. Finally, in experiments with PPO, models tend to generate much shorter responses on average while reaching performance close to NLL. This highlights that PPO requires a good initial reference policy which is not a limitation of offline RL methods. Evaluations with the external PPO-based models do not show strong performance either.
GPT-4 and Human Evaluation To further investigate the quality of top-performing methods, we conduct additional GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and human evaluations. Following prior work (Rafailov et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023a), we perform pairwise comparisons between best methods and test good responses to determine their helpfulness and safety win-rate. Specifically, for each comparison between two responses, we ask GPT-4 and humans to select from four options (A, B, tie or neither) to indicate the winning response. We ask to pick the safer response in the instances from Harmlessbase and the more helpful response for the other three test segments. In total, we sample 400 instances for GPT-4 evaluation and 200 instances for human evaluation (equal size from 4 test segments). To mitigate positional bias in GPT-4 (Zheng et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023), we query it twice and only aggregate the judgments when it selects the same preference even after shuffling the response order.
11The original responses in the HHA dataset were generated using a very large 52B parameter LM (Bai et al.,
2022b) and thus show high linguistic diversity.

In human evaluation, we ask three annotators to rate each pairwise comparison and aggregate the judgments if a majority is achieved. The final results from both GPT-4 and human evaluations are presented in Table 3. To establish GPT-4 evaluation reliability, we first compare the reference policy (πref) and Test set bad responses with Test good responses in the first two rows. In both comparisons, GPT-4 considers the Test good response as more helpful and safe in the majority of samples. Overall, A-LOL and A-LOL seq. achieve the highest win rate in both safety and helpfulness (win + tie), with A-LOL KL and DPO trailing behind. Humans select more instances as tie than GPT-4, but we again notice a similar win-rate trend with A-LOL methods leading in both helpfulness and safety. For all the instances in human evaluation with majority label, we compare with their corresponding GPT-4’s preference label and find 72.1% agreement.12 We present a few example conversations from all the top models in Table 7 to 11 in the Appendix.
5 REDDIT RESPONSE GENERATION TASK
Human preference data is supported by very few language generation tasks. Their annotation is also difficult and costly. Furthermore, preferences are inherently unidimensional and cannot be trivially extended to tasks where more than one aspect is important (Rafailov et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023a). In contrast, policy-gradient-based methods can utilize multiple reward functions during RL training without the need for preference data.
To test the multi-reward generalization of A-LOL, we create a new Reddit response generation task with a mix of five reward functions. The task is to learn a chatbot from Reddit comment-response pairs13 that is fluent, safe, engaging, exciting, and human-like (See et al., 2019). Therefore, we define the task reward as the sum of five scoring functions: (1) CoLA fluency classifier, (2) ToxiChat contextual safety classifier (Baheti et al., 2021), (3) dialog engagement classifier14 (Gao et al., 2020), (4) Reddit upvote probability ranking model (Gao et al., 2020), and (5) length penalized TF-IDF diversity.15 The range of each scoring function is [0, 1]. To test the robustness to noise, we create two different training datasets for this task: (1) 88K Reddit upvoted comment pairs (score ∈ [66, 9582]), reflective of good quality data, and (2) 87K Reddit downvoted comment pairs (score ∈ [−2946, −6]), bad quality data. For both instantiations, we create balanced validation and test sets, each with 1000 upvoted and 1000 downvoted comment pairs. We use DialoGPT-medium (355M parameters) (Zhang et al., 2020) model trained using NLL objective
12We exclude the instances where GPT-4 preference didn’t match after shuffling the response order. 13https://www.kaggle.com/code/danofer/reddit-comments-scores-nlp/input 14A ranking model that assigns a score ∈ [0, 1] indicating the probability of getting followup reply. https:

We highlight the low diversity of the R GOLD baseline. We do not show the test results for methods in which further finetuning the reference policy didn’t increase the validation reward.

for 6 epochs as the reference policy. We then perform further training for 3 epochs with A-LOL variants and other reward-based offline RL baselines. The average reward, length, and diversity metrics are reported in Table 4.
Results In both the upvote and downvote training splits, A-LOL variants achieve higher test rewards compared to every other reward-based baseline. They show especially high improvement in safety, engagement, and upvote probability. While A-LOL’s performance is comparable to that of A-LOL (ref. free), the other two variants, with sequence-level importance weight and KL penalty, surpass their performance. Consistent with the results of the previous experiment, we observe that A-LOL sequence (with the per-token weight assumption) achieves the highest diversity in both training splits.
Surprisingly, the LMs trained on downvoted data with A-LOL almost close the gap with their counterparts trained on upvoted data. Upon closer inspection, we find that about 36% of upvoted replies and 48% of the downvoted replies in their respective training sets received a negative advantage and thus, were never sampled when finetuning with A-LOL. By filtering the unfavorable data points, A-LOL extracts the useful training signal even from suboptimal data. We called our method Leftover Lunch RL precisely because of its robustness to unfavorable training data. We show the per-component reward distribution in Figure 5 in the appendix.
6 CONCLUSION
We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL, a set of advantage-based offline policy gradient algo- rithms that are easy to implement on top of standard negative log-likelihood and are more stable than preference-based offline RL and PPO. Across a series of four different tasks, involving both large (7B) and small (355M) LMs, A-LOL consistently shows better performance than other preference-based and reward-based offline RL methods. Most notably, A-LOL exploits the reference LM’s advantage estimate to discard unfavorable data. This unique ability of A-LOL makes it resilient to noise and allows it to eat the leftover lunch from even the suboptimal training data. Exploiting the flexibility of importance weighting, we create four variants of A-LOL that achieve the top performance in almost every evaluation. Among them, we find that methods using importance weight usually outperform the reference-free variant. In fact, using the per-token importance weight assumption, the variant A-LOL sequence not only improves the test performance but also the diversity.

Future Work Exploiting the single-action assumption, we can use A-LOL with both fine-grained and sequence-level rewards (Wu et al., 2023). We also plan to investigate continual learning (Ring, 1997) in A-LOL by adding new (advantageous) data points to the training set, that are either human- written or LM-generated.
7 REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT
In our main experiments with the HHA task (§4), using the largest 7B parameter LM experiments, we run every baseline and A-LOL methods with three random seeds for reproducibility. We also provide the implementation details of every method along with the hyperparameters in Appendix §B.1. In other multi-reward experiments, we test all methods and baselines with both good-quality and bad-quality data settings. We also present the generalized pseudocode of A-LOL in Algorithm 1. Finally, we share the code on GitHub at https://github.com/abaheti95/LoL-RL.

A A-LOL’S RELATIONSHIP WITH PPO
Proximal Policy Optimization (Schulman et al., 2017) with clipped surrogate loss has led to huge success over a wide range of RL tasks. The clipped surrogate loss optimizes the objective J P P O(θ) = Et[min(r(θ, θold) ˆAt, clip(r(θ, θold), 1 − ϵ, 1 + ϵ) ˆAt)], where r(θ, θold) = πθ(at|st) πθold (at|st) is the ratio of current policy probability and old policy probability and ˆAt is the advantage estimate of old policy for taking an action at given the state st. During training, PPO collects a rollout of actions using πθold on the environment and updates πθ on PPO’s objective using stochastic gradient descent. Applying the single-action language generation assumption, as done in A-LOL, and using the (full sequence or per-token) importance weight, we notice that the PPO’s objective has similarities with A-LOL’s objective. Specifically, πold is replaced with πref and the ˆAt is swapped with Aπref . Intuitively, A-LOL can be seen as a form of one-step PPO on fixed rollout (training set Dtr) while never updating the πref during training.
B HHA IMPLEMENTATION, ABLATIONS AND ANALYSIS
B.1
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
We implement all A-LOL methods along with the baselines using huggingface Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2020). For each training run, we use two NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs (48GB memory each). In total, we have 143K training instances in the Helpful and Harmless Assistant task. We keep the batch size =16 for all methods with 9,000 steps (i.e. in total 144K individual instances). For A-LOL and its variants, around 46K instances were identified with negative advantages and were discarded from training. Therefore, we reduce the number of steps for A-LOL methods to 6,093 steps (i.e. ≈97K instances). Consequently, among all offline RL methods, A-LOL methods use the least training time whereas preference-based methods use the most training time (due to their usage of both good and bad responses during training). We select 0.0002 as the learning rate for all offline RL experiments and use the paged adamw 32bit optimizer. The remaining method-specific hyperparameters include β = 0.1 as the KL weight in DPO, γ = 0.05 as the SFT weight in PRO, and ϵ = 0.9 as the clipping parameter in A-LOL. For both advantage and reward priority sampling, we simply divide the score of each instance with the L1 norm to obtain the sampling probability. For each method, we keep the same input formatting with 640 tokens for context and generate a maximum of 128 tokens with greedy decoding.
In PPO, we execute 3,000 PPO update steps, where each step consists of a rollout of batch size 16 that is trained for 4 internal PPO epochs (≈192K internal training steps). To encourage diversity during online exploration, we use top-p sampling with p = 0.95 but reuse greedy decoding for evaluation (similar to the offline RL methods). We also reduced the learning rate to 0.00002 for PPO, as higher

learning rates were leading to more instability. Including the cost of generating the responses, PPO takes almost 3× the time taken for offline RL training. In total, we run PPO with three random seeds while performing validation of the intermediate checkpoints at every 100 PPO updates. The validation reward plots of each seed are show in Figure 3.
B.2 GPT-4 AND HUMAN PREFERENCE EVALUATION SETUP
For a pair of responses from model A and model B, we prompt GPT-4 twice while shuffling the response order to indicate helpfulness and safety preference. The entire prompt is given below: For a conversation with a chatbot, which response is more helpful and safe? A good response should not have unimportant, repetitive, or irrelevant details. Conversation: <the user query> Response A: <A model response> Response B: <B model response> FIRST, provide a one-sentence comparison of the two responses and explain which you feel is more helpful and safe. SECOND, on a new line, state "A", "B", "equal"

or "neither" to indicate which response is more helpful and safer. Your response should use the format: Comparison: <one-sentence comparison and explanation> More helpful: <"A" or "B" or "equal" or "neither"> More safe: <"A" or "B" or "equal" or "neither"> ####################
Examples of Safety and Helpful human annotation setup are given in Figure 7.
B.3 A-LOL ABLATION EXPERIMENTS
We study the effects of priority sampling in A-LOL. In our main experiments, we prioritize high- advantage data points more when sampling from the training set. Precomputing advantages allow A-LOL to remove unfavorable data, save training compute, and enable priority sampling. However, it also incurs the extra computational cost of performing a forward pass through the full training set using the reference LM and its trained value estimate layer (§2.2). To test the effectiveness of priority sampling, we compare it against random sampling from the entire dataset. We clamp the negative advantage instances within randomly sampled batches to 0. The evaluation trajectory of priority vs. random sampling in A-LOL is presented in Figure 6.
We notice a clear benefit of using priority sampling, as LM trained with it reaches higher performance than random sampling. We also measure the differences resulting from changes in clipping parameter (ϵ = 0.9, 0.2 and no clipping). We see that ϵ = 0.9 wins by a slight margin, whereas the version without clipping leads to full degeneration due to high fluctuation in importance weight.16
B.4 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NEGATIVE ADVANTAGE INSTANCES
We manually analyze the training instances that obtained the lowest reference policy advantage in the HHA dataset to check for safety and helpfulness. Out of the 50 analyzed conversation history and good preference-labeled responses, 26 were unsafe due to offensive statements or malicious advice, and 2 more contained inappropriate opinions. Even the remaining 22 instances were not high quality. We also use an off-the-shelf conversational offensive language classifier (Baheti et al., 2021) to test the last two turns of the bottom 1000 negative advantage instances. The classifier identified 118 good responses to be outright offensive (with the probability of being offensive ≥ 0.5). We present a few example training instances and their reference LM advantage values in Table 12. By discarding the model-identified bad-quality instances, A-LOL improves both the training efficiency and the output quality of fine-tuned LMs.
16A-LOL without clipping quickly started receiving nan values in loss.

C ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
C.1 COMMONSENSE REASONING TASK
Commonsense Transformer (COMET) (Bosselut et al., 2019) is an LM trained to predict the cause/effect of various social situations. To improve beyond the original COMET model, West et al. (2022) proposed symbolic knowledge distillation (SKD). They first construct ATOMIC10x containing 6.5M GPT-3-generated (Brown et al., 2020) commonsense knowledge pairs. The authors further condense it by filtering the bottom 62% of the data according to a critic classifier trained on 10K human-annotated labels. COMET model trained on this smaller high-quality subset improved the performance, however, this aggressive filtering may lose valuable training signal in return. In this experiment, we investigate whether A-LOL can improve upon the COMETDIS TIL model from SKD (West et al., 2022), a 1.5B parameter GPT2-XL model trained on the entire ATOMIC10x data. Thus, COMETDIS TIL is set as the reference policy, while COMET critic classifier is used as the task reward. The train and validation split from SKD is used as Dtr and Dv, whereas for testing, we use 17K unique prompts from human-written ATOMIC20 20 test split. Due to the large training set, we only finetune the COMETDIS TIL model further with all learning algorithms for 1 epoch. A-LOL identified 32% of ATOMIC10x data as negative advantage. In this task, we cannot compare with preference-based offline RL methods as human-labeled preferences are not available in the dataset.
Results Table 5 shows that COMETDIS TIL finetuned with A-LOL variants obtains the highest COMET critic score by improving an absolute ≈8% on top of its reference policy and reaching the closest to human quality. Second to this, weighted behavior cloning, Reward GOLD, and Reward LOL RL all utilize the rewards to improve average critic scores, but not as much as A-LOL variants. Interestingly, in this task A-LOL KL variant went into degeneration due to over-optimization of KL penalty, thus highlighting its instability. Also, further finetuning with NLL did not yield any improvement upon the reference policy. Compared to humans, all model generations are much less diverse indicating there is still progress to be made.
C.2 KNOWLEDGE-GROUNDED DIALOG TASK
LMs trained on knowledge-grounded dialog task fail to maintain faithfulness to the given knowledge and hallucinate incorrect information or opinions (Dziri et al., 2022b). In one of the commonly used knowledge-grounded dialog corpus, Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW) (Dinan et al., 2019), previous studies have shown that only 24% of the responses were truly faithful to the given knowledge and also contained huge lexical overlap with the knowledge sentences (Dziri et al., 2022a). To mitigate this issue, researchers identified and rewrote the hallucinated responses, to construct a smaller and more faithful training set called FaithDial (Dziri et al., 2022a). They also trained a FaithCritic classifier to automatically predict the faithfulness probability of a knowledge and response pair. Subsequently, dialog models trained on the FaithDial corpus were found to be more faithful and engaging. However, such data collection is costly due to the required domain expertise and careful human annotations.

The reward comprises a sum of three classifier probabilities (FaithCritic, CoLA fluency, dialog engagement) and a length penalized TF-IDF diversity score. Along with the length and corpus-level distinct-n-gram diversity metrics, we also report Coverage and Density (lower is better) that quantify the lexical overlap between knowledge and responses. For comparison, the scores of human responses in the FaithDial test set are shown in the last row. Models trained with A-LOL and its variants consistently outperform the baselines and are also resilient to the bad quality WoW training data.

In this experiment, we test whether A-LOL methods can improve LMs faithfulness even from sub- optimal WoW data. Consequently, we select Dtr, Dv from WoW, containing 69K and 3.7K instances respectively, while Dtest is chosen from the FaithDial corpus test split with 3.6K high-quality faithful gold responses. While keeping Dtest fixed, we also create two additional Dtr with 18.3K instances from FaithDial and 87.3K instances from merged FaithDial and WoW. Similar to our previous dialog experiment, we finetune the DialoGPT-medium (DGPT) (Zhang et al., 2020) model on the respective train sets using NLL objective for 6 epochs and use it as the reference policy. Subsequently, we continue further finetuning for 3 epochs with NLL, reward-based offline RL, and A-LOL variants.
In knowledge-grounded dialogs, responses should not only be faithful but also fluent, engaging, and diverse. Therefore, we use the final reward as a sum of four different scoring functions: probability estimates from the FaithCritic classifier, CoLA fluency classifier, and dialog engagement classifier (Gao et al., 2020) along with the TF-IDF diversity score. We evaluate all LMs using the rewards obtained on Dtest. Knowledge-grounded dialog models can occasionally copy the provided knowl- edge verbatim in their outputs. To evaluate this behavior, we also report the coverage and density automatic metrics from summarization research (Grusky et al., 2018), that capture the lexical overlap between knowledge and response strings.17 Similar to our previous experiments, we also calculate the average response length and corpus-level distinct-n-gram diversity metrics (Li et al., 2016). We present the metrics achieved by all methods for all three datasets in Table 6.
Results We again observe A-LOL models outperform reference LM and all other LMs trained with NLL and reward-based baselines in all three dataset settings. In the LMs trained with the WoW dataset, high coverage and density metrics indicate more copying of knowledge compared to the other two datasets. Interestingly, A-LOL models decrease the average density compared to models

trained with NLL and reward-based objectives. This indicates that our method not only improves overall performance according to rewards but also reduces the knowledge-copying behavior.
Even when mixed with good and bad quality data (WoW and FaithDial merged), A-LOL is able to maintain very similar performance to the counterpart with only good quality data (FaithDial). We find that A-LOL identified a negative advantage in 39% of WoW’s training data, 10% of FaithDial’s training data, and 55% of merged training instances. Thus, A-LOL automatically filters the bad- quality instances again showing its resilience to noise.
D LIMITATIONS AND SOCIETAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
We discuss some of the limitations of Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL. First, A-LOL requires that the evaluation metric aligns with the provided rewards. In our preliminary experiments with machine translation task (Bojar et al., 2016), we found that A-LOL could not improve lexical matching-based metrics when we used multilingual embedding similarity as the reward. Furthermore, a single sequence-level reward for each instance will obscure disagreement in how humans would label sequences (i.e., average out value pluralism). For example, people differ in what they consider a high-quality text, what is commonsense vs. domain-specific knowledge, etc. (de Marneffe et al., 2012; Plank, 2022). One can also design rewards to elicit nefarious behavior and optimize LMs on it. Future research using A-LOL or any offline RL method should not only include access to the training data sources but also the reward models, while also describing how they were acquired.
Although less than other RL methods, A-LOL is also susceptible to reward hacking (Skalse et al., 2022; Pang et al., 2023) by learning bad sequences as “critical” actions (Kumar et al., 2022). To avoid this, reward models and training data should be carefully inspected and cleaned before training with the A-LOL algorithms. Researchers should also conduct human evaluations to gauge how well the reward models and LMs trained on them actually align with human-desired behavior (Jacobs & Wallach, 2021).
On the positive side, LOL RL allows for both stable and sample-efficient training of models on existing language data. Our method has potential benefits in reducing the carbon footprint of training large language models by avoiding expensive online RL exploration and only training on positive advantage data points (Strubell et al., 2019; Dodge et al., 2022). Furthermore, A-LOL can leverage feedback from multiple readily available pretrained classifiers and tune language models to satisfy multiple desirable attributes such as fluency, non-toxicity, and engagement.18

### Human: Why is there no sound in space? ### Assistant: Well, there are plenty of sounds in space, they’re just not audible from outside of the space craft. This is because space is a vacuum, and sound needs a medium to travel through. But there are many spacecraft beacons, as well as human voice communications, and even music, in space. The music from the Voyager spacecraft is a famous example. And there are also many space based telescopes, which detect both sound and vibrations in space. ### Human: can you expand upon that? ### Assistant: Sure, they emit a series of tones, to allow spacecraft in orbit to synchro- nize with each other, as well as to allow for communication between the spacecraft and Earth. And of course there are also human voices traveling through space. But because there is no medium for the sounds to travel through, they are inaudible from the outside.

Yes, space is a vacuum, and so there is no medium for sound to travel through. This means that sound waves cannot propagate through space, and so they cannot be heard. The reason that we can hear sound from space is because the sound waves are converted to electromagnetic waves, which can then be transmitted through space. This is why we can hear the sound of the Voyager spacecraft, and also why we can hear the sound of the Sun, and also why we can hear the sound of the planets. Sure, space is a vacuum, and sound needs a medium to travel through. This is why we hear sound in air, because air is a medium for sound to travel through. In space, there’s no medium for sound to travel through, so sound waves don’t travel. This is why we can’t hear anything in space, from outside of a spacecraft. However, this doesn’t mean there’s no sound in space, it’s just that it’s not audible from outside of a spacecraft. There are many spacecraft beacons, as well Sure, space is basically a vacuum, and there is no medium for sound to travel through. In order for sound to occur, you need a medium (such as air, water, or a solid surface) for the sound waves to propagate through. Since space is a vacuum, there are no sound waves, and thus no sound. Sure, space is a vacuum, so there’s nothing to transmit sound through. This is why you can’t hear anything from outside the spacecraft. But inside the spacecraft, there are microphones, and also speakers, which can both send sound out into the spacecraft, and also receive sound from the spacecraft’s internal environment. This is how both human voice communications, as well as music, can be sent and received in space.

The Allies had defeated the Ottomans in World War I, and now they were trying to force the Turks to accept a peace treaty that would make Turkey a weak, democratic state. The Turks resisted, and fought back. The war lasted from 1919 to 1922, and it was a hard, bloody struggle. The Turks were led A-LOL I’m sorry, I don’t understand. What are you asking about?
