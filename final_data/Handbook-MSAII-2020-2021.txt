Introduction
The Language Technologies Institute (LTI) has prepared this statement of policies, program requirements, guidance, process and procedures for students in the M.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII) program. A copy of this handbook is also available online at the program website: msaii.cs.cmu.edu.
The University Student guide, The Word, which details university-wide policies, is also available online at www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword.
Additional resources specific to graduate students can be found at www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/
While this handbook is specific to your academic experience in the MSAII program, there are several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their time at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, the student handbook, the Graduate Education Office, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are included in an appendix to this handbook. It is the student’s responsibility to be familiar with all policies related to their educational and community experience at Carnegie Mellon University.
1.1 The MSAII Degree
The M.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII) is a professional master's program offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. This program seeks to educate students in the innovative use of artificial intelligence to create practical solutions in a wide variety of application areas. As artificial intelligence matures, there is a great need for students who can envision, design, plan and deliver solutions that integrate AI technologies such as deep leaning, natural language processing, robotics and big data analytics into new applications. The program stresses both intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship and encourages students to develop ideas for startups and for introduction into established companies.
The curriculum is designed for students who have a strong background in computer science with interest in in-depth study of AI to enable them to develop real-world applications, especially in areas to which AI has not yet been applied. The integrated curriculum includes coursework and team projects leading to a full-semester capstone project to produce a working prototype.

1.4 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance
Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state or local laws or executive orders.
7


Inquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be directed to the university ombudsman, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, telephone 412-268-1018. Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling 412-268-2000.
Carnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report describing the university's security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault and fire safety policies, and containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on the campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412-268-2323. The annual security and fire safety report also is available online at www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports.
Information regarding the application of Title IX, including to admission and employment decisions, the sexual misconduct grievance procedures and process, including how to file a report or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment, and how the university responds to such reports is available at www.cmu.edu/title-ix. The Title IX coordinator may be reached at 5000 Forbes Ave., 140 Cyert Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; 412-268- 7125; or tix@cmu.edu.
1.5 The Carnegie Mellon Code
Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct possible.
These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.
The discovery, advancement, and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.
8


The commitment of its faculty, staff, and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.
The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/.
1.6 The Reasonable Person Principle (RPP)
It is a long-standing and revered principle of the School of Computer Science (SCS) that members of our community are expected to act reasonably, and therefore we try to keep formal, written SCS policies to a minimum. The faculty do not burden the students with numerous rules, and, in return, we expect the students to not try to find technical loopholes that violate the clear intent of program policies. In any situation not covered by an explicit rule, you should ask yourself how reasonable people would behave in that situation. The RPP does not alter University-wide policies.
2 The Language Technologies Institute
2.1 Working Space for MS Students
Except for restrictions due to COVID, full-time students in the LTI’s MS degree programs on the Pittsburgh campus have access to a shared working space to create a sense of community and provide space for working when on campus. In-person meetings, outside of a class being conducted in a classroom, are banned during COVID until further notice.
2.2 Photocopies and Printers
Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental resources are located in GHC 5404
The use of a photocopier requires only a CMU ID card. The School of Computer Science provides a number of black-and-white and color printers for use by students. The SCS Computer Facilities publishes a list of printers online at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/. When you send a file to the print queue, you may go to any of the listed printers, swipe your CMU ID, and the file will be printed on that printer.
2.3 Computers for MS Students
9


Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access university resources and complete course assignments. Laptops running Windows, MacOS, and Linux software are all acceptable.
MS students will be given a CS user id. A CS user id is required to use the LTI computer cluster, department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science has a Help Center located at 4203 GHC. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu, extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line.
MS students will be given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.
3 Degree Requirements
3.1 Course Grade and GPA Requirements
To receive the M.S. degree, all students must take and successfully complete at least 195 units of coursework. All required Core Courses must be completed with a grade of B or better. For the Knowledge Area Courses, students must maintain a B average. No grade lower than C shall be used for credit applied toward graduation. No undergraduate courses count toward the 192- unit requirement.
All Core courses are organized in sequence, and must be taken in the following order:
Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (11-651) – No prerequisite required. • AI Engineering (11-695) – Prerequisite is the completion of 11-651 with a grade of “B” or better.
LTI Practicum (11-935) – Three credit units for completing the required Internship. • AI Innovation (11-654) – Prerequisite is the completion of 11-695 with a grade of “B” or better.
Capstone (11-699) – Prerequisite is the completion of 11-654 with a grade of “B” or better.
Students are required to repeat any required course that they have completed with a grade less than the required minimum, preferably at the next offering. (Please note that Core courses and Knowledge courses are only offered once per year.) Students will be allowed to retake a required course only once. If a student fails in the second attempt, he or she will be dropped from the MSAII program.
If a student fails an elective course, she or he will need to repeat the same or take a substitute course (equivalent course approved by the Director).
10


All grades count towards the program QPA, except for repeated courses, in which case the final grade replaces the previous grade. Courses taken pass/no pass do not affect the student’s QPA. However, ONLY ELECTIVE COURSES MAY BE TAKEN PASS/NO PASS, unless the Provost directs to the contrary. Students who do not achieve the required minimum grade in a required course, who elect to take an “incomplete” in a required course, or whose cumulative grade point average is below a B (3.0), will be placed on academic probation. Students on probation are not eligible to graduate. Students who are placed on academic probation shall receive written a notice of this finding, including a list of measures that need to be taken to be removed from academic probation. A student on academic probation for two consecutive semesters may be dropped from the program.
The MSAII program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each semester in order to monitor individual student progress toward graduation. Should a student’s effort fall below the acceptable academic performance and/or fail to meet the standards established by the MSAII program and Carnegie Mellon University, the student may be dismissed from the program.
Should a student’s overall QPA drop below 3.0 during any given semester, he/she will be placed on departmental probation for the following semester and will be required to improve his/her grades to no less than overall 3.0 QPA during that period. Failure to improve to an overall 3.0 QPA or better the following semester may result in termination from the program. In addition, a student who violates policies established by Carnegie Mellon University may be dismissed from the program.
After each academic progress review, a student may receive one or more letters, indicating the result of the review. Warning letters are issued for the following cases:
1) Overall QPA below 3.0 (Academic probation) 2) Semester QPA is below 3.0 3) Grade below B in a Core course 4) Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) according to the university policies. This includes any AIV letter received in 15-513 during the summer preceding matriculation.
A student may be terminated from the program under any of the following circumstances:
a) A student who has received two Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letters will be terminated. There are no exceptions and the Program Director has no discretion over such a termination as it is an LTI policy.
b) A student who has received one Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letter may be terminated by the Program Director if the violation is so serious that the student cannot be allowed to remain in the MSAII Program.
c) A student has received three warning letters of any type from the MSAII program.
11


d) A student has been found to have violated a University Policy for which termination is
provided.
An AIV letter or violation of University Policy may be appealed pursuant to CMU appeal procedures. See Section 4.5.2, below. However, a decision to terminate a student after appeal because of conditions a), b), c) or d) is not appealable.
3.2 Course Requirements
1) Summer Before Entrance
Admitted students are required to take, pay for, and pass the 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems course during the summer prior to their arrival at Carnegie Mellon, but the summer class is only 6 units and will not be counted toward graduation units. 15-513 may be taken pass/fail, but it cannot be dropped. A student who drops 15-513 during the summer will not be permitted to begin the degree program in the fall, but must retake 15-513 the following summer. The MSAII course offerings are available at msaii.cs.cmu.edu/curriculum. The university’s complete Schedule of Classes can be found at https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/search.
Students are then required to take and successfully complete the courses below:
2) The Core Courses (87 units) - Must be taken in sequence:

11-785, Deep Learning (12 units). Second spring semester.
One more 12-unit AI course of the student’s choice (with approval of the Program Director)
In the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a similar degree of difficulty may be substituted with the permission of the Director. If a student has already taken an equivalent course and shows proficiency in the subject area, a more advanced course in the area may be taken in place of these required courses with permission of the Director. Graduate students cannot receive credit for undergraduate courses.
4) Electives:
A minimum of 36 units of SCS courses must be taken. It is recommended to take one elective in the first fall semester, one or two in the first spring semester, one or two in the second fall semester and zero or one in the second spring semester. The courses below are approved. A student who wants to take a course not listed must obtain approval of the Director prior to registering. In general, the Director will approve any graduate SCS course of not more than 12 units. It is also possible to seek approval for courses in other Colleges at CMU. However, those courses must be rationally related to an AI career in order to be approved.

Courses carrying more than 12 units in a semester are NOT APPROVED as electives. The university’s complete Schedule of Classes can be found at https://enr- apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/search.
Students may take athletics or music or theatrical performance courses that do not require work outside of class times. However, such courses will NOT count toward the 195 units required for graduation.
3.3 Advising
3.3.1 Student Advising
Every MSAII student will be assigned an advisor, normally the Program Director. Before the course registration period each semester, students must meet with their advisor to discuss their course selection. New students will be given instructions to register for their classes during the MSAII orientation.
3.3.2 Monitoring Progress
The advisor meets with the student at least twice a year, providing guidance and monitoring the student’s overall progress.
3.3.3 Degree Certification
Students who graduate having met all the requires for the degree will receive a diploma stating that they have received as “Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation.”
3.4 Internship
Students must obtain an internship during the summer between the first and second years of the program. This is a requirement. An internship will provide students with the opportunity to apply the knowledge and technical skills learned during the first year of the program, to gain insight into AI and future market needs to further their experience and develop a strong context for the second-year concentration coursework. Normally the internship will be with an outside company. In some circumstances, a student who is doing research with a CMU faculty member during the summer may request that such research qualify as an internship.
14


Students are encouraged to intern with an organization that corresponds to their individual area of interest and career goals.
All students who secure summer internships must register for three units in 11-935 (LTI Practicum). This course can be taken once during the program with Pass/Fail and will be counted toward graduation units. International students must apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) for the internship by contacting the Office of International Education (OIE). To obtain CPT, students need an offer letter spelling out employment dates, work hours, and wages or stipend. It is the student’s responsibility under 11-935 to give a presentation during the semester following the internship to all current MSAI students detailing the student’s internship experience.
International students who are interested in working in the U.S after graduation should apply for the Optional Practical Training (OPT). The office of International Education (OIE) oversees the OPT registration. Note: OPT must only be used after students have completed their degree at Carnegie Mellon.
NOTE: Students are personally responsible for securing a suitable internship. The Career and Professional Development Center will assist in their search for counseling, workshops, and internship opportunity listings in CareerNavigator. We strongly suggest students begin the internship search beginning in the Fall of your first year. Some internship opportunities have application deadlines in the Fall, so by starting your search early, you won't miss out on these internships. The Career and Professional Development Center will assist students with the internship search, but does not match students with employers; obtaining an internship is students’ responsibility.
The following steps are recommended to ensure a successful internship outcome. Many of the events below will be conducted remotely during COVID.
September/October
Meet with your advisor to discuss your interests and plan your internship search. • Review the internships of previous students. We also encourage you to speak informally with second-year students who can offer first-hand information about their internships. • Attend the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) at Carnegie Mellon for exposure to potential employers for internships.
November/December
Begin researching organizations and internship opportunities. Pay close attention to organizations that have established internship programs and their deadlines.
Attend workshops to perfect your resume, hone your interviewing skills, and gain knowledge about the internship search process.
January/February
15


At this point, you should have a “short list” of organizations at which you would like to intern. This list can include organizations that have established internship programs as well as those that interest you without formal internship programs. • Update your resume with relevant academic projects, coursework, etc. • Begin utilizing your network for internship leads as well as checking organization’s websites for internships.
Make contact with employers, sending resumes and applications, and initiating internship interviews in person or by phone.
Attend Network Nights and talk to alumni about internship opportunities in their organization. They are an excellent resource for learning more about a particular organization, career field or employment opportunity. You can find alumni in the Alumni Directory, Alumni Career Advisor Network, and Carnegie Mellon Alumni LinkedIn Network.
March/April
At this point, you should have secured an internship or be interviewing with various organizations.
Prepare a backup plan if your first choices of internships do not work out. • Attend relevant Network Nights and Career Fairs at Carnegie Mellon. • • MSAII students should enroll in 11-935 for three units. You will not have to pay tuition for this course.
3.5 Employment Eligibility Verification
If you are receiving compensation from CMU, if you are going to be a TA or you are planning to seek a position with CMU, then Employment Eligibility Verification is required.
Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below.
To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf] covering the university’s I-9 and E-Verify requirements:
Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment.
Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources.

3.6 MSAII Orientation
Each Fall semester, the MSAII program provides a program orientation to help new students learn about the program. All new students are required to attend them and treat them seriously because they explain the program sequence, its Core and Knowledge courses requirements and how students will meet the program learning outcomes.
3.7 End of Semester Evaluation
The MSAII program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each semester in order to monitor individual student progress towards graduation. Should a student’s effort fall below the acceptable level of academic performance and/or fail to meet the standards established by the MSAII program, the student may be dismissed from the program.
After each academic progress review, a student may receive one or more letters, indicating the result of the review. See Section 3.1, Course Grade and GPA Requirements, above.
At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent "black mark" on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.
In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student a letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.
3.8 Enrollment Verification
Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript, and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/transcripts/.

3.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading
3.9.1 University Policy on Grades
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html
This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.
3.9.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses & PCHE
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses are taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken but without a grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this.)
3.10 Academic Integrity
Carnegie Mellon’s Academic Integrity policy is posted at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. All students are expected to be familiar with this policy, including the university-wide protocol for handling academic integrity violations. The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html) is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.
It is an absolute requirement that the work you submit must be your own, unless you specifically identify the source of any material that is not yours. This includes quotations and material from websites. In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any
18


person other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that work. Any student who violates the academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in suspension or expulsion under University policies. THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE FACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY.
You are not permitted to copy material from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them as your own work. Any copied material MUST appear in quotation marks or italics and MUST be accompanied by a citation to the original source. Failure to do this violates CMU’s Policy on Academic Integrity, which states, “In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources is required. … Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals without proper attribution or citation. Unique ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be graded.”
It is a violation of academic integrity for you to assist anyone else in violating the policy or to provide your work to others to assist them. Because team deliverables are the product of joint work, it is the responsibility of each member of a team to ensure that all team materials have been produced in conformance with CMU policies. Credit cannot be given for work that is not a student’s own. Therefore, if one member of a team violates a policy, for example, by copying material from the Internet without indicating its source, then no one on the team can receive credit for that work, even if only one student is directly guilty of violating the policy.
We are aware that acts that constitute cheating can be viewed very differently in different countries and cultures. However, Carnegie Mellon is a U.S. university and its policies reflect U.S. culture. Employers expect that students who graduate from Carnegie Mellon have obtained their degree legitimately and according to Carnegie Mellon policies. If you have any doubt whether proposed conduct would be considered cheating under Carnegie Mellon policies, ASK A FACULTY MEMBER OR THE DIRECTOR FIRST.
All violations of the Academic Integrity policy MUST be reported to the University administration by the faculty members involved. Copies go to the Program Director, the Head of the Language Technology Institute, the Associate Dean for Master’s Programs, and various officials at Warner Hall. The faculty do not have the option to decline to make a report. The offending student will receive an email to inform them of an Academic Integrity Violation (AIV). The email will specify the offense and the penalty, and will inform the student of available appeal procedures. An AIV that is successfully appealed is erased.
Important note: The university policy gives a department the option of “conven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.” The LTI has a “two strikes” rule. The LTI may terminate a student for a first violation, depending upon the circumstances and severity of the violation. The LTI always terminates a student for a second violation, with no exceptions.

4 Academic Policies
4.1 Course Registration
4.1.1 Status
All Students must be registered for at least 48 units during each semester. Any questions about registration should be directed to the Enrollment Services (the HUB). Note that International students are required to be registered as full-time students, minimum 36 units.
4.1.2 Academic Calendar
The Academic Calendar can be found at www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar.html. All dates about registration, add/drop deadlines, university holidays and more can be found there.
4.1.3 Online Registration
All new students will already be registered for required courses and will be able to register for electives during the MSAII orientation session. After that, students will register following the schedule set by the HUB. Note that students must meet with their advisor to obtain approval for their course selection. Registration information is available at www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/registration/index.html. Online registration is done with an Andrew ID at www.cmu.edu/hub/sio.
Students must register for at least 48 units per semester.
4.1.4 Pass/No Pass Courses (Pass/Fail)
With the approval of the Program Director, a graduate student may choose to take an ELECTIVE course pass/no pass. Core courses and Knowledge courses may not be taken pass/no pass. By the deadline for changing a course to pass/no pass, the student must fill out the Pass/No Pass Approval Form and receive permission from the course’s instructor. Classes taken pass/no pass cannot be used to fulfill graduation requirements, and pass/no pass status is irrevocable. (A form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html)
4.1.5 Auditing a Course
With the approval of the Program Director, a graduate student may audit a course by obtaining the permission of the instructor or teaching department and completing the Course Audit Approval Form. Audited classes are not taken for credit and cannot be used to fulfill graduation requirements. (Audit form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html)
20


4.1.6 Adding a Course
During the ADD period of each semester (the first two weeks of the semester), students may add a course by registering online. After the ADD deadline, they may add a course by completing the Late Add Request form and obtaining the permission of both: 1) the instructor or teaching department and 2) their advisor. (Add form can be found at www.cmu.edu/hub/forms)
4.1.7 Dropping a Course
Dropping courses is not recommended except for reasons of health or family emergency. Many SCS courses have long waitlists, and dropping a course means that some other student who might have had the opportunity to take the course had been denied that ability. Also, if students in the MSAII program drop courses, then the instructors of those courses may no longer allow MSAIIs to enroll.
Sometimes, however, a student’s workload can become unexpectedly heavy because of course requirements. No one is expected to suffer from such pressure and dropping a course may become a necessity. To avoid this unfortunate circumstance, you should inform yourself in advance of the curriculum and workload in each course you plan to take and ensure that you are capable of handling the load. Note that CMU SCS courses are very difficult, and students who may easily have handled taking five courses simultaneously at another institution may not be able to do so at CMU.
Exact add, drop and withdrawal dates may be found on the official Academic Calendar. Up until the deadlines, students can initiate course adds and drops through Student Information Online (SIO). Courses dropped by the deadline will not appear on the student's record, and courses withdrawn from by the deadline will receive a 'W' grade. Additionally, a voucher process has been implemented for late drops.
Students taking undergraduate and Master’s level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course- changes/index.html.
Late Course Drops & Vouchers
A late drop voucher system was implemented beginning with the fall 2018 semester to permit a limited number of late course drops. Master's students are permitted one drop voucher per year of study and may use only one voucher per semester (including summer). Courses dropped using a voucher will be removed from the student's record, as long as the drop is confirmed in SIO by the student within 24 hours of receiving the automated voucher email (refer to instructions below). Students may use drop vouchers up until the last day of classes each
21


semester. These policies are spelled out at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course- changes/index.html.
Note that the Core courses and some Knowledge courses are only offered once per year so dropping a course may delay program completion.
Note: International students must maintain a minimum of 36 units (Full time) to meet the U.S. government’s visa requirement. Please check with the Office of International Education (OIE) for more information.
4.1.8 Transfer Credits
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html
Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this.).
The MSAII program does not accept transfer credits.
4.1.9 Leave of Absence
Students who need to delay their studies for personal, medical or academic reasons may do so with a leave of absence (leaving the university temporarily with a commitment to return). Students must contact the MSAII Director to discuss their plans and fill out the appropriate form. The student’s place in the program will be held until a mutually determined time. For more information refer to www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html. When planning to return from Leave of Absence students must complete the appropriate paperwork before returning to the University.
4.1.10 Withdrawal
Students who need to withdraw from the program (leave the university with no intention of returning) for personal, medical or academic reasons must contact the MSAII Director to
22


discuss their plans and fill out the appropriate form. For more information refer to www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html.
4.2 Tuition and Fees
Information about tuition and fees is available at www.cmu.edu/hub/tuition/index. MSAII students will pay tuition according to the rates set for the School of Computer Science. All tuition and fees must be paid in full by the due date; a student not in good financial standing will be dismissed from the program. Students taking summer courses must pay tuition.
4.3 Graduation Ceremonies
The University holds one Commencement ceremony in May of each year. Only students who have completed their degree requirements may participate in Commencement.
There are no August or December commencement ceremonies.
4.4 LTI Academic Policies
4.4.1 “Grandfather” policy
A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period.
4.4.2 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption
The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the program director, on the advice of the faculty member for whose course an exemption is sought. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the exempted course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.
23


4.4.3 Employment/Consulting
Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the Program Director's consent. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any paid position. Students may use their consulting time to perform unpaid work on research projects for CMU faculty.
4.4.4 Leave of Absence
The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA) since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most one year, upon written request to the MSAII Director and with the consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.
Students taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university’s leave of absence process, which is described at www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- life/student-leave.html.
4.4.5 Satisfactory Progress
If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on “End of Semester Evaluation.”
4.5 Carnegie Mellon Academic Policies
4.5.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities
The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the Carnegie Mellon community. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations must submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form to access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process.
For more information, please see www.cmu.edu/hr/eos/disability. Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268-6121.
24


4.5.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures
Students who believe that they have been inappropriately treated are encouraged to raise their concern(s) with the Program Director, department head, or other designated person in their department, college, or central administration according to University policies. No effort will be made to prevent or discourage anyone from availing themselves of such procedures (see Graduate Student Appeal and Procedures www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance- procedures.html).
Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource web page. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program. Additionally, students may confer with the Graduate Education Office (graded@andrew.cmu.edu) on issues of process or other concerns as they navigate conflicts.
4.5.3 Process for Appealing Final Grades
https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html.
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy
4.5.4 Safeguarding Educational Equity:
Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith. The University’s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-
25


governance/sexual-harassment-and-sexual-assault.html. If you believe you have been the victim of sexual harassment or sexual assault, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources:
Office of Title IX Initiatives, http://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/, 412-268-7125
Sexual Harassment Advisors, found in Appendix A of the Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault;
Survivor Support Network, found in Appendix B of the Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault;
Sexual Harassment Process and Title IX Coordinators, found in section II of the Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault;
University Police, 412-268-2323
University Health Services, 412-268-2157
Counseling & Psychological Services, 412-268-2922
Additional resources and information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources- and-information/resources.html.
The MSAII program has a ZERO TOLERANCE policy on sexual harassment and sexual assault. If you are found to have violated Carnegie Mellon policy, you will be dropped from the MSAII program immediately without exception. CMU has spent decades successfully developing a non-threatening environment for all genders and no one will be permitted to interfere with that accomplishment.
Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate Students
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html
This policy is relevant for graduate students who will be in a supervisory role of undergraduate students as a TA or in a research lab/studio setting. This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.
4.5.5 Cultural Tolerance
The MSAII program is extremely diverse for a program of its size. We have students from numerous different countries who must work effectively in a team setting. The students
26


invariably come from very different cultures that have differing attitudes towards age, gender, and group interaction. The program management understands this, but the students must also recognize that this program is being conducted in the United States and operates according to U.S. norms. Students and faculty, regardless of background, age, or rank, must deal with each other respectfully without insult or raised voices. It is impossible to conduct teamwork in any other way. Violations will be dealt with harshly. The Program Director is not sympathetic to such behavior, which will not be tolerated. Repeated infractions, or a serious single infraction may result in termination from the program.
4.5.6 Language Policy
The MSAII program is a component of the Language Technologies Institute, which studies and celebrates the diversity of human language and forms of expression. The LTI also recognizes the futility and unfairness of attempting to determine the language students must use when communicating. However, it is unprofessional in any official team meeting to speak a language that is not understood by all team members. For example, if all members of a team understand Chinese, then they may use Chinese in team meetings. However, if even one team member does not understand Chinese, then a language must be used that is understood by all team members. It is recommended that non-native speakers of English use English as much as possible if they intend to seek employment in an English-speaking country.
4.5.7 Maternity Accommodation Protocol
Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of the semester may consider taking time away from their coursework and research responsibilities. All female students who give birth to a child while engaged in coursework or research are eligible to take either a short- term absence or formal leave of absence. Students in course work should consider either working with their course instructor to receive incomplete grades or elect to drop to part-time status or to take a semester leave of absence. Students engaged in research must work with their faculty to develop plans for the research for the time they are away.
Students are encouraged to consult with relevant university faculty and staff as soon as possible as they begin making plans regarding time away. Students must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations. Students will complete an information form and meet with a member of Dean’s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student. Planning for the student’s discussion with her academic contact(s) (advisor, associate dean, etc.) will be reviewed during this meeting.
4.6 Statute of Limitations
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html.
27


Students must complete all requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program.
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master’s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.
Any request for a waiver of the statute of limitations must be approved by the Department Head and by the SCS Associate Dean for Masters Programs. The waiver request must explain the exceptional circumstances that warrant an extension. For cases in which a waiver is granted, the waiver will cover specific courses and will specify a time period for completion of the program.
See also the ‘Duration of Study’ policy.
5 Financial Issues
5.1 Graduate Student Funding
The LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional MS programs. Students are encouraged to seek financial aid and support from other sources. The HUB website (www.cmu.edu/finaid/graduate/index.html) provides the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links. Additional information on financial issues for graduate students can be found on the web at www.cmu.edu/hub/new-grad/.
Students in the professional MS programs are not prohibited from seeking support as Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants. However, typically full-time MS students do not have time for these activities. Typically Research Assistantships are most likely to be awarded to students in Carnegie Mellon’s research-oriented degree programs.
28


5.2 University Financial Aid
Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website: www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html. Students will find the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links.
5.3 Health Insurance
Carnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree-seeking students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered by the University or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is “enrolled as the dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance plan” (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/).
It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester, or elect a payment plan over the course of the academic year. More information is available at the Student Health Services Web site www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/.
5.4 Emergency Loans
www.cmu.edu/student-affairs
All students regardless of their program are eligible for the Emergency Student Loan, which is an interest-free and emergency-based loan repayable within 30 days. It is available through the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs; students may apply for the loan by stopping in to the Student Affairs Office, Warner Hall 301, or by calling (412) 268-2075 for an appointment.
6 Additional University Resources
6.1 The HUB Student Services Center
thehub@andrew.cmu.edu and www.cmu.edu/hub/
The HUB is located in Warner Hall, Lower Level. The HUB staff delivers comprehensive service and counsel to students and families regarding financial aid, billing and payment, registration and academic records. The Assistant Directors in The HUB serve as contacts for specific colleges and assist enrolled students with key aspects of the enrollment process. A student can find their
29


assigned HUB Assistant Director on their Student Information Online (SIO) Resource page. Questions that need specialized, in-depth attention can be directed to the student's assigned Assistant Director. For general questions and information, students may email The HUB or call 412-268-8186.
6.2 Student Information Online (SIO)
Student Information Online (SIO) is a secure site where students can find important, personalized information, including E-Bills and student account information, financial aid status and eligibility, grades and QPA, and course schedules. Students can update their and their spouse’s or domestic partner's contact information, sign up for E-Check & E-Refund, authorize their spouses, domestic partners or another individual to receive a copy of their E-Bill, request verifications, view their housing and meal plan assignments, and much more. Students can log on to SIO by going to www.cmu.edu/hub/sio and entering their Andrew User ID and password.
On SIO, students will designate an emergency contact address of a relative or family friend to be contacted in the case of an emergency. If students do not want their name and address published in the campus directory, they must notify the HUB in writing.
6.3 ID Cards
Graduate students can obtain their ID card from The HUB once they have been entered into SIO for the semester. These cards identify their holders as members of the campus community. Student cards are deactivated upon the cardholder’s separation from the university.
Affiliate ID Cards are available for spouses and partners of graduate students that allow them to access Carnegie Mellon’s campus. These cards are available through The HUB to spouses and partners of graduate students who are enrolled for the current academic year in a full-time graduate degree program. The card is valid for one year. For information about domestic partner registration, visit the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs webpage: www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/domestic-partner/.
For more information about student and affiliate ID cards (spouse, domestic partners and dependent children), please visit https://www.cmu.edu/oie/settling-in-guide/information-for- families.html.
6.4 Transcripts
Information about and instructions for ordering transcripts are available at: www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/transcripts/. Transcript questions may be directed to esg-transcripts@andrew.cmu.edu.
30


6.5 Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration
www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/registration/cross/index.html
Cross-registration provides an opportunity for enriched educational programs by permitting full-time graduate students to cross-register for courses (usually no more than one per semester) at a Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) Institution. Full-time Carnegie Mellon degree students are eligible and the PCHE course may not count towards full-time status unless the student is enrolled in an inter-university program. Students interested in taking advantage of this opportunity should be familiar with the Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses already outlined previously in this handbook.
Department specific information about graduate students’ ability to cross register and transfer grades should be included here.
6.6 Student Privacy Rights and FERPA
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/privacy-rights-students.html
This university policy notifies students of their rights under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). According to FERPA, students have the right to:

inspect and review their education records;

request an amendment to their education record if they believe they are inaccurate or misleading;

request a hearing if their request for an amendment is not resolved to their satisfaction;
consent to disclosure of personally identifiable information from their education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent;

file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Family Policy Compliance Office if they believe their rights under FERPA have been violated.
For questions about Student Privacy Rights, FERPA or filing a complaint, contact John Papinchak, University Registrar, jp7p@andrew.cmu.edu, in Enrollment Services.
6.7 Academic Calendar
The official academic calendar is published by Enrollment Services. It is not uncommon for departments and colleges to have academic requirements that differ from or are in addition to those presented in the academic calendar provided to the campus community by Enrollment Services. This section is an opportunity for the department to confirm the official academic calendar for graduate students and provide the link to the calendar: www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/docs/2021-academic-calendar.pdf. Be clear about the expected
31


academic calendar of the department, and/or provide additional information about formal requirements on a student’s time.
6.8 Professional Development
The Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) (www.cmu.edu/career/)at Carnegie Mellon is a centralized career center staffed by a team of seasoned and highly-educated professionals who orchestrate the career exploration, experiential learning, and career networking needs of students and alumni.
Carnegie Mellon's career and professional development model is grounded in discipline-specific career development, experiential learning, and employer relations shaped by strong connections with the university's seven academic colleges. The center's success is founded upon a solid understanding of career and professional development theory, integration of technology, and an unwavering commitment to providing personalized attention towards meeting the unique individual needs of students, alumni, and employers. The CDPC is located on the second floor of the West Wing Dormitory, 412-268-2064.
The Office of the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education (AVPGE) offers a robust schedule of professional development opportunities. Some are geared towards a specific population (master’s students, PhD students at the beginning of their program, graduate students seeking tenure track positions, etc.) and others are open to all graduate students (time management, balancing, staying healthy).

Learning Support
Supplemental Instruction: Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an academic support model that utilizes peer-assisted study sessions. The SI program provides regularly scheduled review sessions on course materials outside the classroom. SI is a non-remedial approach
41


to learning as the program targets high-risk courses and is available in select courses based on data related to past student performance and feasibility.
Peer Tutoring: Weekly Tutoring Appointments are offered in a one-on-one and small group format to students from any discipline who need assistance with a course that may not be supported by our other services. Weekly appointments give students the opportunity to interact regularly with the same tutor to facilitate deeper understanding of concepts. Students can register online through the Student Academic Success website. • Academic Coaching: Academic Coaching provides holistic one-on-one peer support and group workshops to help students find and implement their conditions for success. We assist students in improving time management, productive habits, organization, stress management, and study skills.

“Just in Time” Workshops: The Student Academic Success team is available to partner with instructors and departments to identify skills or concepts that would benefit from supplemental offerings (workshops, boot camps) to support students’ academic success and learning. We are eager to help convene and coordinate outside of the classroom skill-building opportunities that can be open to any student interested in building skill or reinforcing course concept mastery.
Study Partners: Support for students to create and benefit from their own study groups: The Student Academic Success team assists students in forming and benefiting from peer study groups, whereby all students can reap the benefits of peer-to-peer learning, student agency, and collaboration skill development. Staff from the Student Academic Success Center will be made available to instructors and students to assist with the formation of peer-led study groups. This level of support is open to any course where the instructor requests or agrees such support is appropriate and students are interested in both leading and participating.
Language and Cross-cultural Support More than 60% of graduate students at Carnegie Mellon are international students, and others are nonnative speakers of English who have attended high school or undergraduate programs in the US.
