ABSTRACT
b e F 5 1
This paper describes our submission to the Second Clarity Enhance- ment Challenge (CEC2), which consists of target speech enhance- ment for hearing-aid (HA) devices in noisy-reverberant environments with multiple interferers such as music and competing speakers. Our approach builds upon the powerful iterative neural/beamforming en- hancement (iNeuBe) framework introduced in our recent work, and this paper extends it for target speaker extraction. We therefore name the proposed approach as iNeuBe-X, where the “X” stands for ex- traction. To address the challenges encountered in the CEC2 setting, we introduce four major novelties: (1) we extend the state-of-the- art TF-GridNet model [1], originally designed for monaural speaker separation, for multi-channel, causal speech enhancement, and large improvements are observed by replacing the TCNDenseNet used in iNeuBe [2] with this new architecture; (2) we leverage a recent dual window size approach with future-frame prediction [3] to ensure that iNueBe-X satisﬁes the 5 ms constraint on algorithmic latency required by CEC2; (3) we introduce a novel speaker-conditioning branch for TF-GridNet to achieve target speaker extraction; and (4) we propose a ﬁne-tuning step, where we compute an additional loss with respect to the target speaker signal compensated with the listener audiogram. Without using external data, on the ofﬁcial development set our best model reaches a hearing-aid speech perception index (HASPI) score of 0.942 and a scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (SI-SDRi) of 18.8 dB. These results are promising given the fact that the CEC2 data is extremely challenging (e.g., on the development set the mixture SI-SDR is −12.3 dB). A demo of our submitted system is available at WAVLab CEC2 demo.

DNN1 and the beamformer. This reﬁnement can be iteratively per- formed, following [2]. Our system is trained to operate with a 32 kHz sampling rate and with an STFT with 16 ms window, 4 ms stride, and the square-root Hann window. This would give such system a theo- retical latency of 16 ms [3]. To overcome this, we train both DNN1 and DNN2 to predict the current plus future 3 frames of the target anechoic signal, so that a new synthesized frame output can be ob- tained for each 4 ms stride. This is done in practice by padding zeros to the left of the input mixture STFT. The beamforming operation is performed in a frame-online fashion to comply with the 5 ms con- straint on algorithmic latency required in CEC2. We employ a causal multi-channel Wiener ﬁlter as in [2, 3]. Since the listener head can rotate in CEC2, instead of simply accumulating the statistics, we use the recursive averaging strategy [5] with a 0.5 forgetting factor.

1.2. Speaker Enrollment Embedding Extraction
1. PROPOSED METHODS
For DNNspk, we use the encoder and TCN modules (and remove the decoder) of the TCNDenseNet architecture [2, 6] to extract speaker embeddings. As the enrollment utterances are available beforehand, this DNN can be non-causal and its output can be cached before infer- ence for each target speaker. Given a complex spectra A of a monau- ral adaptation utterance, this DNN extracts a ﬁxed-length speaker em- bedding Xadapt ∈ R128 by performing mean-pooling over time on the outputs of the TCN module. The speaker embedding is then leveraged as an additional cue by the iNeuBe framework for target extraction. Differently from [2, 6], we use a smaller DNN, with 3 TCN repeats, 4 TCN blocks, 128 TCN channels, and 16 hidden channels in the down- sampling Conv2D and DenseNet layers of the encoder. This amounts to a total of around 0.6 million (M) parameters.
1.1.
iNeuBe-X System Overview
Our proposed iNeuBe-X system is depicted in Fig. 1. It is motivated by the iNeuBe framework [2], which contains two multi-microphone input single-microphone output (MISO) DNNs [4], with the ﬁrst one producing an initial target estimate for beamforming and the second one performing post-ﬁltering for better enhancement. One key dif- ference is that here we condition each MISO DNN with a speaker- enrollment embedding extracted from a third DNNspk module, which is jointly trained with the rest and takes as input an enrollment utter- ance of the target speaker. Given the complex multi-channel short- time Fourier transform (STFT) spectrogram of the mixture signal, Y , the ﬁrst DNN (denoted as DNN1 in Fig. 1) estimates the complex STFT spectrogram ˆS(n) (at iteration n = 1) of the anechoic target speech captured at a reference HA array mic, which is set to “CH1 Left” in CEC2. This estimate can then be reﬁned by a second step, which involves a DNN-supported beamformer, and a second MISO DNN (denoted as DNN2) with additional inputs from the outputs of

For both DNN1 and DNN2 we use TF-GridNet [1], which is a state- of-the-art separation model that recently achieved an impressive 23.4 dB SI-SDRi on the WSJ0-2mix dataset [7]. Motivated by this strong result, we extended this model to multi-channel scenarios as

CH1 Left from the multi-channel mixture signal using complex spec- tral mapping. We use the Adam optimizer with 0.001 learning rate and batch size 1. We clip gradients with L2 norm more than 1. The MISO DNNs are trained on random 4 s segments of the input signal, which are constrained in such a way that the target and the interferer- only beginning part should appear both at least for 1 s. We use the whole development set for validation. The learning rate is halved if the validation loss is not improved over 5 epochs. We follow the scale-invariant loss function suggested in [2], which is deﬁned on the estimated time-domain signal and its magnitude. Differently from [2], we use a multi-resolution STFT ﬁlterbanks with 512-, 1024-, 2048-, 256- and 128-sample windows to compute multiple magnitude losses. We observed that the magnitude loss leads to clearly better HASPI. Since this loss is scale-invariant, to prevent clipping in inference we re-scale the MISO DNNs’ estimates in a frame-online fashion using the output of the MCWF.

depicted in Fig. 2. Since it uses complex spectral mapping, we feed all channels by simply stacking the real and imaginary (RI) compo- nents of all input channels [2] to TF-GridNet, converting it to a MISO model named as MISO-TF-GridNet. We use feature-wise linear mod- ulation (FiLM) [8] over the speaker embedding extracted by DNNspk at the beginning of each TF-GridNet block to condition the separa- tion. Note that TF-GridNet proposed in [1] is non-causal. Here we make the following modiﬁcations to achieve frame-online process- ing. Firstly, we use layer normalization (LN) after the ﬁrst Conv2D layer. Secondly, we use a causal full-band self-attention module by masking the attention matrix. Thirdly, we use a modiﬁed sub-band temporal module, where we employ an unidirectional LSTM (instead of bidirectional as in [1]) and, in the unfolding operation, we stack only the previous frames’ features with the current. This way, the sub-band temporal module can output one frame for each frame in the input if the stride is set to 1.
To further improve HASPI, after training DNN2 to convergence, we ﬁne-tune DNN2 by adding an additional loss term where the same multi-resolution loss is computed between NAL-R ﬁtted target ane- choic speech and NAL-R ﬁtted DNN estimates. Since listener au- diograms are not available in the training set, we randomly sample audiograms from the development set listeners to perform this ﬁtting- aware training.
We use the same hyper-parameters suggested in [1], except that E is set to 2 here. The resulting TF-GridNet has around 8 M param- eters and the full iNeube-X model (with DNN1 and DNN2) roughly doubles that amount.
2. RESULTS ON DEVELOPMENT SET
We report our results obtained on the CEC2 development set in Table 1 in terms of SI-SDR, STOI, PESQ and HASPI. Note that SI-SDR, STOI and PESQ are computed before listener adaptation and compression while HASPI is computed after. Together with the proposed iNeuBe-X, we also report the performance for two non- causal methods: iNeube (only DNN1, based on TCNDenseNet) [2] and a DNN-based masked beamforming approach from the ESPNet- SE++ toolkit [12], which employs a two-layer bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) and weighted prediction error (WPE) followed by min- imum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming. As another comparison, we report the scores of the unprocessed mix- tures and the oracle target speech. The latter can be considered as a reasonable upper bound for our proposed system, since we employ a similar compensation strategy. Note that the CEC2 baseline system does not perform enhancement, and only performs listener adapta- tion and dynamic range compression. For our proposed systems, we report performance for various conﬁgurations and training strategies in the third panel: iNeube-X with only DNN1, iNeube-X with DNN2 trained using the additional loss after listener adaptation (+ DNN2 + NAL-R ﬁne-tune), and with external data (+ DNN2 + NAL-R ﬁne-tune + External Data). The two latter systems are the ones we submitted to CEC2. We found that an additional iteration of beam- forming followed by post-ﬁltering led to slightly better HASPI, at a cost of increased computational overhead. Thus we only submitted signals obtained after the ﬁrst DNN2 reﬁnement step.
1.4. STFT-domain NAL-R and Dynamic Range Compression
We found that enhancement alone is not sufﬁcient for obtaining an high HASPI. Without any compensation to listener’s hearing loss, the HASPI for the oracle target speech is less than 0.7 on the develop- ment set. To perform ﬁtting in a frame-online fashion, we perform the NAL-R ﬁtting [9] and dynamic range compression in the STFT domain. We followed the dynamic range compression algorithm im- plemented in [10], and set the knee to -10 dB, threshold -40 dB, ratio 1.2, knee width 4, attack 0.05 s, and release 0.2 s, respectively. As we use in iNeuBe-X 16 ms STFT windows, the length of the NAL- R equalization ﬁlter was set to 80 taps. When fed the oracle target anechoic speech, our STFT-domain NAL-R ﬁtting plus compression algorithms produces an HASPI score of 0.987, which is slightly lower than the 0.998 score obtained by the CEC2 baseline ﬁtting algorithm. This is likely due to the shorter NAL-R ﬁlter used in our algorithms, but our oracle score is still acceptable.
1.5. System Training Conﬁgurations and External Data Usage
We trained models on two datasets, the original CEC2 data, which we scaled up to 16k scenes using the provided scene generation script, and this 16k scenes plus additional 6k scenes generated using the same conﬁguration except for external clean speech taken from Lib- riVox in order to increase speaker variations.
We emphasize that our system enjoys an algorithmic latency of 4 ms, and we conﬁrm that the proposed system satisﬁes the 5 ms con- straint on algorithmic latency using this public code1.
Regarding training, we ﬁrst train DNN1 with DNNspk to conver- gence, and then freeze these two and train DNN2 using the output of these two plus the MCWF ouput. As explained in Section 1.1, the two MISO networks are trained to estimate the target anechoic signal at
