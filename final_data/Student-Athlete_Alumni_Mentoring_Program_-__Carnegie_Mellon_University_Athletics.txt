Student-Athlete Alumni Mentoring Program

Carnegie Mellon Athletics is focused on developing leaders. Our ambition is for our student-athletes to take the skills and abilities developed as members of our intercollegiate athletics program into the broader world to lead meaningful lives while impacting society in profound ways. The Carnegie Mellon Student-Athlete Alumni Mentoring Program was created as a platform to foster relationships between past and present student-athletes to provide guidance, wisdom and opportunities to the current generation of Tartans.

The Carnegie Mellon Student-Athlete Alumni Mentoring Program will connect our world-class students and alumni in professional-based mentoring relationships. With a mentoring-specific software platform to guide the connections and communication, the mentoring program is designed to help current student-athletes develop an advantage as they prepare for careers, and to provide student-athlete alumni with the opportunity to stay connected with the Tartan community in a meaningful way.
