1.6 The Carnegie Mellon Code
Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical, and moral conduct possible.
These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.
The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.
The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.
The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/.
1.7 University Policies and Expectations
It is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines. In addition to this departmental graduate student handbook, the following resources are available to assist you in understanding community expectations:

3 CMU Degree Completion and Certification
3.1 Standard Degree Requirements & Degree Certification
Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary significantly ranging from two semesters for some full-time master’s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.
Early Completion Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances.
Extended or Longer-than-Standard Completion Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.
Master’s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program, and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. Students shall reference CMU Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations: www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of limitations.html regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time allowable for master’s degree completion and certification.
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 11


3.2 Statute of Limitations
As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations, https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html students will complete all requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program.
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master’s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.
3.3 Additional Guidance for Students
Program of Study Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.
Financial Aid and Student Account Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master’s degree programs.
International Students Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.

4.5 Practice Requirements
A student must complete at least 66 practice-oriented course units and satisfy the following practice-oriented requirements for both MIIS-16 and MIIS-21 programs.
1. Directed study requirement: Students must pass 24 units (typically 12 units x 2 semesters) in directed study under the supervision of their advisor. Directed study is a structured, task-oriented form of independent study that provides deep, hands-on experience in a particular technology area and an opportunity to work closely with a member of the faculty.
2. Internship requirement: Students must complete a one-semester (typically summer) internship at an organization (typically a company or government agency) approved by the MIIS Program Director. Internships are an opportunity to apply new skills in a professional setting and to learn about software development in a ‘real world’ organization. Students with prior professional experience may petition the MIIS Program Director to waive this requirement. MIIS students that do an internship during the summer semester are required to present their internship at a poster session at the beginning of the following Fall semester. The poster and the student’s participation in the poster session are part of the internship requirement. Participation is required unless waived in writing by the MIIS Program Director.
3. Capstone requirements: Students must complete a capstone project (36 units) and a capstone planning seminar (6 units). The capstone requirement gives students experience with collaborative, team-oriented software development; significant hands- on experience with the techniques studied in the classroom; and an opportunity to work on a large software application. a. The capstone project (36 units) is a large, group-oriented demonstration of student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically, the result of the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project is supervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly basis to monitor progress and provide guidance.
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 16


b. The capstone planning seminar (6 units) organizes students into groups; defines capstone project goals, requirements, success metrics, and deliverables; and identifies and acquires data, software, and other resources required for successful completion of the project. The planning seminar must be completed in the semester prior to taking the capstone project.
4.6 Registration Process/Procedures
Students are responsible for registering for their courses. Use the Stellic Degree Audit Application to monitor your progress and plan your degree. Students can search for relevant courses in a number of ways and share your plan with your advisor directly through the application.
Navigate to the SIO Academic Info tab and select Enrollment Status and the upcoming
semester to confirm the following:
Enrollment Status is 'Eligible to Enroll' (if not, email thehub@andrew.cmu.edu) • Maximum units for which you can plan to register for (overloads are reviewed and permitted only after registration week)
Class Level, College and Department are correct (if incorrect, please contact your home
academic department)
The registration process can be completed within SIO (Student Information Online) by following 4 easy steps: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/docs/4-easy-steps.pdf
If students have any questions about course selection, students may reach out to MIIS program director, Teruko Mitamura.
4.7 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures
Students taking undergraduate and master’s level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course- changes/index.html. Please note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does not apply to Masters’ students.
4.8 Transfer Courses and Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE)
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 17


Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross- registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will not be considered for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations.
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html
NOTE: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college’s and department's policies allow this.
4.9 Internships
If the experience will have units attached to it, the program should have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. Students are responsible for identifying and applying for internships on their own. The LTI and the university provide several types of support for students seeking internships.
An annual poster session helps spread information from MIIS students that recently completed internships to MIIS students that will soon seek internships; other LTI professional master’s programs have similar internship-oriented poster sessions that MIIS students may attend. The university offers resume-writing and interviewing workshops to help prepare students and fall and spring employment fairs to help students connect with companies. The university’s Career & Professional Development Center https://www.cmu.edu/career/ provides other services as well.
If a student cannot find an internship, the MIIS program will arrange an on-campus internship with a university-based project. This internship may be unpaid.
International students are required to consult with Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract (required addition to ensure the university is in compliance with immigration laws for F & J status students).
4.10 Advising
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 18


Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed study projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.
How and when the advisor is selected: Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. Typically, if a student and faculty member agree to enter an advising relationship, it is approved by the Program Director. If a student has not found an advisor after one month in the program, the Program Director will assign an advisor to the student.
How to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem, assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here. It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time.
4.11 LTI Orientation
Prior to the beginning of each Fall semester the LTI provides lectures and faculty research talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and to treat them as seriously as a course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. Students do not have to register for the LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks, nor do they receive a grade, however the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.
The LTI Orientation Canvas course is a mandatory course designed to increase incoming LTI graduate students' awareness and understanding of CMU's community standards and the resources that CMU offers the students. The course includes several administrative tasks, training, and educational sessions. The students will be enrolled into the course by the program administrator in early August. All MIIS students are expected to complete all assignments by the end of their first semester in the program. Each assignment has its own due date.
4.12 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures
Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 19


processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program.
Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures - Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu)
4.13 Intellectual Property Policy
The MIIS degree program adheres to Carnegie Mellon University policy on intellectual property: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html
5 Grading and Evaluation
5.1 Grading Scale/System
Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed study and capstone projects by satisfying the following grade requirements:
1. Minimum grade: A student must obtain a B- or better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student receives a C or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree requirements.
2. Minimum QPA: A student must maintain an average QPA of at least 3.0 in courses and projects used to satisfy degree requirements.
3. Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.
5.2 Pass/Fail Grades
Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement, except for the 11-696 (A) Capstone Planning Seminar and 11-935 (R) LTI Practicum that are a Pass/Fail.
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 20


Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.
5.3 Independent Study
An independent study can be counted as an Elective course, but it cannot be counted as a Qualifying course.
5.4 University Policy on Grades
This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html
5.5 Process for Appealing Final Grades
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university policy.
Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures - Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu)
5.6 Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses
Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross- registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 21


QPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college’s and department's policies allow this.)
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html
5.7 End of Semester Evaluation
Near the end of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes their achievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester. At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degree.
A good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual.
If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent "black mark" on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.
In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.
5.8 Satisfactory Progress
If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program or strongly encourage the student to consider switching to the four-semester program (MIIS-21) to complete all the requirements.
5.9 Academic Integrity
Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 22


A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.
In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.
Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.
In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.
The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process.
Important note: The LTI implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program”. Our procedure is as follows: a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide to not immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation. If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.
6 Academic Policies
6.1 MIIS Academic Policies
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 23


6.1.1 Double Counting Courses
A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. (SCS policy)
6.1.2 Duration of Study
MIIS-16 students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in three semesters of academic study and one summer internship (16 months total).
MIIS-21 students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in four semesters of academic study and one summer internship (21 months total).
MIIS-16 students enrolled for part-time study are expected to complete the program in six semesters of academic study and one summer internship (27 months total).
MIIS-21 students enrolled for part-time study are expected to complete the program in seven semesters of academic study and one summer internship (31 months total).
See also the ‘Statute of Limitations’ policy.
6.1.3 Deferral
MIIS students are given the opportunity to defer their enrollment. The deferral request must be approved by the program director. The deferral can only be used once for the period of one academic year.
6.1.4 Maximum and Minimum Course Loads
A student in the program may not take more than sixty (60) units per semester without permission from the program director.
A student in the program must be registered for a minimum thirty-six (36) units per semester to be considered a full-time student or twelve (12) units per semester to be considered a part- time student. All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status. Reduced Course Load is not permitted for MIIS students. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, “permit of stay”). (MIIS policy)
6.1.5 Transfer Credit
An equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the MIIS breadth requirements. The decision on whether a course may be used to satisfy a breadth requirement is made by the MIIS Program
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 24


Director. Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student’s transcript to make the decision.
Satisfying a breadth requirement with a course from another institution does not reduce the number of CMU course units that must be taken to attain the MIIS degree.
See the section on “Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption” on page 25.
6.1.6 Transferring into the MIIS Program
Transfers into the MIIS program are not permitted during a student’s first semester at CMU. Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them.
Students may request to transfer into the MIIS program after completing their first semester and before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MIIS Program Director. The MIIS Program Director will inform the student about what application materials are required, for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities.
The MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request. The program will explicitly consider whether the coursework done prior to the transfer will allow the student to be “on schedule” by the end of the spring semester, so that the student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall semester.
MIIS students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS-16 to MIIS-21 and vice versa) after beginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests must be filed within the first semester of the program. It is highly recommended to not switch tracks more than once! Though not forbidden, multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration records of international students. Students also must understand that extension of their stay in the program will lead to additional financial obligations.
U.S. citizens, virtually, have no restrictions on how many times they can switch if it is done for a legitimate reason. To confirm legitimacy of the reason to switch tracks ALL students must seek their advisor's approval and the approval of the Director of the MIIS program.
6.1.7 Transferring Out of the MIIS Program
The MIIS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MIIS degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 25


6.2 LTI Academic Policies
6.2.1 Verification of Enrollment
Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript, and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student- records/verifications/enrollment.html.
6.2.2 “Grandfather” policy
A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period.
6.2.3 Time Away from Academic Responsibilities
Graduate students should not assume that their time-off follows the academic calendar of courses. Many are coming from an undergraduate environment where their university employment followed their course schedule. For many graduate degree programs, there is an expectation that graduate students continue research during academic breaks and time away from campus which may or may not be negotiated with the students. If there are requirements for student time beyond a typical week day, this should be specified. Clarify that University Holidays are also student holidays, and students need to consult their faculty about coverage if they have challenges with taking time off during University Holidays. For example, if experiments are running that need to be monitored continuously students should speak with their faculty about arrangements to take an equal number of days off at another time.
6.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption
The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 26


6.2.5 External Employment/Consulting
Since the MIIS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment and/or consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss this with their Advisor. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment.
6.2.6 Leave of Absence
The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.
6.2.7 Withdrawal of a Degree
The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html.
6.2.8 Winter and Summer Breaks
Students supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is typically allowed in the summer. The normal winter break policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks and takes vacation for the other two weeks.
7 Safeguarding Educational Equity
7.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities
http://www.cmu.edu/education-office/disability-resources/
The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook

7.3 Gestational and Parental Accommodations
https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html
Providing holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols on this page are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families.
Students seeking any of the Parental Accommodations described below must register with the Office of the Dean of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling 412-268-2075.
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 28


Students are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstance. At the time of registering, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, procedures, funding options and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with the student’s academic department. Students should also consult with their academic advisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of Students.
Accommodations for Gestational Parents
The birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic pursuits for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away from their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two options as possible accommodation:
Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents – A short term absence from academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks. Short-Term Accommodation may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, where a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include extensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping courses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a Short-Term Accommodation will remain enrolled.
Formal Leave of Absence– A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave Policy. Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full-semester, mini-semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the is taken. Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence ( https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html ) drop all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for the semester. International students must consult with the Office of International Education ( https://www.cmu.edu/oie/ ) before considering this option due to visa implications. leave
Financial Assistance for Student Parents
Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who become parents while enrolled:
Interest Free Loan – Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest- free parental loan (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/) from the Office of the Dean of Students.
7.4 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate
Students
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 29


This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual, or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html
7.5 Employment Eligibility Verification
If you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/hr/restrict/employment-eligibility-verification-policy.pdf covering the university’s I-9 and E-Verify requirements:
Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment.

Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required.
For more information, please see CMU’s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/recruiting/restrict/i-9- guidance.pdf , or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify https://www.cmu.edu/hr/service-center/new-faculty-staff/i-9-e- verify/index.html and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9 https://go.oncehub.com/I9Appointment.
Students who fail to complete the Form I-9 in a timely manner may have stipend payments suspended. If employed by the university, an individual who fails to timely complete the Form I-9 may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
8 Financial Support
8.1 Graduate Student Funding
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 30


The LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional master’s programs. Students are encouraged to seek financial aid and support from other sources. The HUB website (https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/index.html) provides the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links. Additional information on financial issues for graduate students can be found on the web at http://www.cmu.edu/hub/new-grad/.
Teaching assistantships are awarded to faculty members who then award these positions to selected students. Teaching assistant duties include, but are not limited to, holding office hours, conducting recitation classes, and grading. There are minimum English proficiency requirements that must be met for a student to accept a teaching assistantship. Pennsylvania state law requires that all students who are not native speakers of English take and pass a state administered proficiency test. Support for teaching activities can be found through the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence, located in Warner Hall 425. Students who will be T.A.s for the department are encouraged to visit the Teaching Center and to take advantage of the information and services located there.
Students in the professional master’s programs are not prohibited from seeking support as Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants. However, typically, fulltime master’s students do not have time for these activities. Research Assistantships are most likely to be awarded to students in CMU’s research-oriented degree programs.
MIIS students can apply for TA positions only with the permission of the program director. Teaching Assistantships are especially discouraged for first semester students.
8.2 University Financial Aid
Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website (http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/graduate/index.html.) Students will find the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links.
8.3 Health Insurance
Carnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree seeking students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered by the University or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is “enrolled as the dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance plan” (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-health-insurance.html.
It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester or elect a payment plan over the
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook
Page 31


course of the academic year. More information is available at the Student Health Services Web site www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/HealthServices/insurance.
8.4 Emergency Loans
https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/billing/emergency-loans.html
All students regardless of their program are eligible for the Emergency Student Loan, which is an interest-free and emergency-based loan repayable within 30 days. It is available through the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs; students may apply for the loan by stopping into the Student Affairs Office, Warner Hall 301, or by calling (412) 268-2075 for an appointment.
8.5 Office of the Dean of Students Emergency Support Funding
Graduate students who find themselves in need of immediate funds for emergency situations should contact the Office of the Dean of Students: https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/ to inquire about the types of emergency funding available to enrolled students.
9 Additional University Resources
9.1 The HUB Student Services Center
thehub@andrew.cmu.edu and http://www.cmu.edu/hub/
The HUB is located in Warner Hall, Lower Level.
