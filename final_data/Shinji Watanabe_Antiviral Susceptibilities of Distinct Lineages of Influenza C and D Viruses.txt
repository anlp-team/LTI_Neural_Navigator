Abstract: The emergence and spread of antiviral-resistant inﬂuenza viruses are of great concern. To minimize the public health risk, it is important to monitor antiviral susceptibilities of inﬂuenza viruses. Analyses of the antiviral susceptibilities of inﬂuenza A and B viruses have been conducted globally; however, those of inﬂuenza C and D viruses are limited. Here, we determined the susceptibilities of inﬂuenza C viruses representing all six lineages (C/Taylor, C/Yamagata, C/Sao Paulo, C/Aichi, C/Kanagawa, and C/Mississippi) and inﬂuenza D viruses representing four lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, and D/Yama2019) to RNA polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir and favipiravir) by using a focus reduction assay. All viruses tested were susceptible to both drugs. We then performed a genetic analysis to check for amino acid substitutions associated with baloxavir and favipiravir resistance and found that none of the viruses tested possessed these substitutions. Use of the focus reduction assay with the genotypic assay has proven valuable for monitoring the antiviral susceptibilities of inﬂuenza C and D viruses as well as inﬂuenza A and B viruses. Antiviral susceptibility monitoring of all inﬂuenza virus types should continue in order to assess the public health risks posed by these viruses.

Inﬂuenza viruses are diverse, rapidly changing, enveloped RNA viruses with a widespread global presence. Four types exist: inﬂuenza A virus, inﬂuenza B virus, in- ﬂuenza C virus, and inﬂuenza D virus. Three classes of antivirals have been approved for inﬂuenza treatment or prophylaxis in Japan: an M2 inhibitor (amantadine), neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir), and RNA polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir). Laninamivir and favipiravir are approved only in Japan. Because favipiravir increases the risk of teratogenicity and embryotoxicity, it received conditional marketing approval with strict regulations for its production and clinical use [1]. The M2 inhibitor blocks the M2 ion channel of inﬂuenza A viruses and inhibits virus uncoating [2]. The NA inhibitors bind to the NA enzyme active site of in- ﬂuenza A and B viruses and inhibit virus release from infected cells [2]. The inﬂuenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase consists of three subunits: polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA) in inﬂuenza A and B viruses or polymerase 3 protein (P3) in inﬂuenza C and D viruses. Baloxavir binds to the PA endonuclease domain and inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease activity of

the PA subunit [3]. Favipiravir acts as a chain terminator or a mutagen and inhibits RNA elongation, which is carried out by the PB1 subunit [4].
Antiviral-resistant influenza A viruses have emerged and spread globally. In 2003–2004, the prevalence of M2 inhibitor-resistant A(H3N2) viruses carrying an S31N substitution in the M2 protein increased markedly in China; these viruses spread globally during 2005–2006 [5]. Since the currently circulating inﬂuenza A viruses possess the M2 S31N substitution, the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend the use of the M2 inhibitors for the treatment or prevention of inﬂuenza A virus infections. Inﬂuenza A(H1N1) viruses carrying an H275Y substitution in the NA protein, which confers cross- resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir, emerged in Europe during the 2007–2008 inﬂuenza season and spread globally within a year. In 2009, inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, which were susceptible to NA inhibitors, emerged and replaced the NA H275Y mutant A(H1N1) viruses. Although a widespread cluster of baloxavir-resistant viruses has not been detected, human-to-human transmission of inﬂuenza A(H3N2) viruses carrying an I38T substitution in the PA protein, which confers resistance to baloxavir, has been reported [6–8]. The emergence and spread of antiviral-resistant viruses are of great concern. Because global surveillance of antiviral resistance is essential, the WHO Global Inﬂuenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) Expert Working Group for Surveillance of Antiviral Susceptibility (WHO-AVWG) has been conducting a global analysis of circulating inﬂuenza A and B viruses for NA inhibitor and baloxavir susceptibilities by using a combination of phenotypic methods analyzing antiviral susceptibility and genotypic methods detecting amino acid substitutions associated with antiviral resistance [9].
Inﬂuenza C and D viruses contain the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin-esterase- fusion (HEF), which combines the functions of the hemagglutinin (HA) and NA pro- teins of inﬂuenza A and B viruses. Based on the HEF gene sequences, inﬂuenza C and D viruses are classiﬁed into six (C/Taylor, C/Yamagata, C/Sao Paulo, C/Aichi, C/Kanagawa, and C/Mississippi) [10] and ﬁve (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, D/Yama2019, and D/CA2019) [11] lineages, respectively. The M2 inhibitor and NA inhibitors are not active against inﬂuenza C and D viruses. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is highly conserved among inﬂuenza A, B, C, and D viruses [12]. A few studies have examined the susceptibility of some inﬂuenza C and D viruses to baloxavir and favipiravir by using con- ventional cell-based assays, a plaque reduction assay [13] and a yield reduction assay [14] in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells; however, their ﬁndings were limited. We have been conducting global and nationwide monitoring of the baloxavir susceptibility of inﬂuenza A and B viruses by using a focus reduction assay in MDCK cells and humanized MDCK cells, hCK cells [15], which express high levels of α2, 6-sialoglycans and very low levels of α2, 3-sialoglycans [9,16]. The focus reduction assay is sensitive, robust, and less laborious than conventional cell-based assays and is highly suitable for the surveillance of antiviral susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses [17]. Furthermore, we have successfully applied this assay to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells and Vero E6-TMPRSS2-T2A-ACE2 cells [18–22]. Here, we deter- mined the susceptibilities of inﬂuenza C viruses representing all six lineages and inﬂuenza D viruses representing four lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, and D/Yama2019) to baloxavir and favipiravir by using this assay. Since inﬂuenza D viruses replicate well in MDCK cells and swine testicular (ST) cells [23], we applied this assay to ST cells. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report describing the focus reduction assay for inﬂuenza C and D viruses and the antiviral susceptibilities of Japanese lineages of inﬂuenza D viruses D/Yama2016 and D/Yama2019.
2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Viruses and Cells
Inﬂuenza C viruses were propagated in MDCK cells (NBL-2, ATCC CCL-34) in Dul- becco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) supplemented with 5 µg/mL N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin

at 34 ◦C. Inﬂuenza D viruses were propagated in ST cells (ATCC CRL-1746) in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA supplemented with 0.5 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin at 34 ◦C. The phy- logenetic analyses of the inﬂuenza C and D viruses used in this study were previously reported [10,24]. D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 and D/bovine/Nebraska/9-5/2012 were kindly provided by Dr. Benjamin Hause (South Dakota State University, USA).
Inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Yamagata lineage viruses served as reference wild-type and baloxavir-resistant viruses. Inﬂuenza A and B viruses were propa- gated in MDCK cells containing 0.2% BSA supplemented with 1 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin at 34 ◦C. Inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses possessing the PA I38T substitution were reported in our previous studies [25,26]. RG-B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (wild-type) and RG-B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (PA I38T mutant) were kindly provided by the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Inﬂuenza, Melbourne.
2.2. Antiviral Compounds
The active form of baloxavir marboxil (baloxavir acid) and favipiravir were purchased from Funakoshi Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), respectively. Both compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide.
2.3. Focus Reduction Assay
Baloxavir and favipiravir susceptibilities were determined by using the focus reduction assay as previously described [16] in MDCK cells and ST cells. Since ST cells are more sensitive to TPCK-trypsin than MDCK cells, the assay conditions were modiﬁed for ST cells. Brieﬂy, conﬂuent monolayers of cells in 96-well plates were infected with 1000 focus- forming units (FFU) of virus/well. Virus adsorption was carried out for 1 h at 37 ◦C for efﬁcient binding and then an equal volume of Avicel RC-581 (2.4% in MDCK cells; 1.2% in ST cells, DuPont Nutrition USA, Wilmington, DE, USA) in culture medium containing serial dilutions of baloxavir acid (0.025–2500 nM) or favipiravir (0.01–1000 µM) supplemented with TPCK-trypsin (1.0 µg/mL for inﬂuenza A, B, and D viruses or 5.0 µg/mL for inﬂuenza C viruses in MDCK cells; 0.5 µg/mL for inﬂuenza A, B, C, and D viruses in ST cells) was added to each well in triplicate. The cells were incubated for 18 h at 34 ◦C and then ﬁxed with formalin. After the formalin was removed, the cells were immunostained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the nucleoprotein of inﬂuenza A (A1 and A3, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), B (B2 and B4, Merck KGaA), C (H27) [27], and D (2A5) viruses, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (SeraCare Life Sciences, Milford, MA, USA). Since the monoclonal antibody 2A5 reacts nonspeciﬁcally with ST cells, a mouse monoclonal antibody against the HEF of inﬂuenza D virus (1E12) was used in ST cells. The infected cells were stained with TrueBlue Substrate (SeraCare Life Sciences) and then washed with distilled water. After cell drying, the focus numbers were quantiﬁed by using an ImmunoSpot S6 Analyzer, ImmunoCapture software and BioSpot software (Cellular Technology, Cleveland, OH, USA). The results are expressed as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, which were calculated by using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

Criteria to deﬁne RNA polymerase inhibitor susceptibility have not yet been estab- lished; therefore, provisional criteria based on IC50 fold-change thresholds, compared to the median for wild-type viruses of the same type, subtype, and lineage, are used by the WHO-AVWG [9]. The provisional criteria deﬁne inﬂuenza virus inhibition as normal (<3-fold increase) or reduced (≥3-fold increase). Reference A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Yamagata lineage viruses possessing the PA I38T substitution showed 110-, 85-, and 15-fold higher IC50 values in MDCK cells and 110-, 91-, and 19-fold higher IC50 values in ST cells, respectively, than their corresponding wild-type viruses for baloxavir. However, these I38T mutant viruses had comparable IC50 values for favipiravir to their corresponding wild-type viruses in MDCK cells (0.5- to 1.1-fold increase) and ST cells (0.7- to 2.0-fold increase). The wild-type B virus showed higher IC50 values for baloxavir than wild-type A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses in both cell types, consistent with previous reports using MDCK cells [3,16,30].

Viruses 2023, 15, 244
Based on the internal gene sequences, six lineages (C/Taylor, C/Yamagata, C/Sao Paulo, C/Aichi, C/Kanagawa, and C/Mississippi) of inﬂuenza C viruses and four lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, and D/Yama2019) of inﬂuenza D viruses were classiﬁed into two groups, respectively; C/Yamagata and C/Mississippi for inﬂuenza C viruses [10] and D/OK and D/Yama2016 for inﬂuenza D viruses [24]. We found no signiﬁcant differences in the IC50 values for baloxavir among the distinct lineages of inﬂuenza C or D viruses. The median IC50 values for baloxavir were 10.89 nM in MDCK cells and 10.32 nM in ST cells for inﬂuenza C viruses and 48.10 nM in MDCK cells and 31.08 nM in ST cells for inﬂuenza D viruses, respectively. The fold-changes in IC50 values compared with the median value for tested viruses were 0.6- to 2.3-fold in MDCK cells and 0.8- to 1.7-fold in ST cells for inﬂuenza C viruses and 0.9- to 1.1-fold in MDCK cells and 0.4- to 1.2-fold in ST cells for inﬂuenza D viruses, respectively. These results suggest that inﬂuenza C viruses are more susceptible to baloxavir than inﬂuenza D viruses, consistent with a previous study [14]. All Inﬂuenza C and D viruses tested had comparable IC50 values for favipiravir. The median IC50 values for favipiravir were 20.91 µM in MDCK cells and 20.76 µM in ST cells for inﬂuenza C viruses and 17.37 µM in MDCK cells and 27.16 µM in ST cells for inﬂuenza D viruses, respectively. The fold-changes in IC50 values compared with the median value for tested viruses were 0.6- to 1.4-fold in MDCK cells and 0.8- to 2.8-fold in ST cells for inﬂuenza C viruses and 0.7- to 2.1-fold in MDCK cells and 0.4- to 1.7-fold in ST cells for inﬂuenza D viruses, respectively. The IC50 values of the reference B viruses for favipiravir were similar to those of inﬂuenza C viruses, as previously reported [13], suggesting that favipiravir susceptibilities of inﬂuenza B viruses are approximately comparable to those of inﬂuenza C and D viruses.
The I38T substitution in the PA protein that is associated with baloxavir resistance emerged after baloxavir treatment in the Phase II and III clinical trials of baloxavir [3,31–33]. No mutant viruses with reduced susceptibility to favipiravir emerged after favipiravir treatment in clinical trials of favipiravir; however, in vitro studies have shown that a K229R substitution in the PB1 protein confers about a 30-fold reduction in favipiravir susceptibility of inﬂuenza A viruses [34]. We therefore checked for amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to baloxavir and favipiravir in the inﬂuenza C and D viruses used in this study (Figure S1). The P3 and PB1 gene sequences of the viruses were screened for amino acid substitutions at position 38 in P3 and position 231 in PB1, which corresponds to position 229 in inﬂuenza A viruses. None of the inﬂuenza C and D viruses tested possessed the P3 38T or PB1 231R substitutions. However, the amino acid at position 38 of inﬂuenza D virus P3 was found to be valine, which was recently reported to confer a 3.0- to 3.7-fold increase in IC50 values to baloxavir [9].
4. Discussion
Inﬂuenza C and D viruses are genetically more closely related to each other than to inﬂuenza A or B viruses, suggesting a common ancestor for C and D viruses [35]. Inﬂuenza C virus was ﬁrst isolated from humans in 1947 [36] and is widely distributed throughout the world. It infects humans, dogs, swine, camels, horses, and bovines, although humans are the primary host [37]. Inﬂuenza C virus causes relatively mild respiratory illness; however, it can cause bronchitis and pneumonia, particularly in children younger than 2 years or patients with underlying illnesses [38–42]. Inﬂuenza D virus was ﬁrst detected in swine in 2011 [23]. Since then, the virus has been detected in bovines in several countries including USA, Mexico, France, Japan, Italy, China, and Ireland [43–48]. Global serological studies have shown that inﬂuenza D virus has a broad host range, including humans, swine, sheep, goats, camels, horses, and bovines, although the primary host of inﬂuenza D virus is bovines [37].
Inﬂuenza D viruses, as well as inﬂuenza C viruses, use 9-O-acetylated sialic acids (Neu5,9Ac2) as the host cell receptor [49] and replicate efﬁciently in a human well-differentiated respiratory epithelium model (i.e., human airway epithelial cells: hAECs) [50]. Inﬂuenza D virus genomes have been detected in one (2.3%) of 44 or one (4.2%) of 24 bioaerosol

samples from a hospital emergency room [51] and an airport [52], respectively in North Carolina, USA and in one (1.3%) of 78 nasal washes from pig farm workers in Sarawak, Malaysia [53]. Moreover, a high seroprevalence (94–97%) of antibodies to inﬂuenza D virus was detected among cattle workers in Florida, USA [54]. These observations indicate that inﬂuenza D virus has the potential to cause zoonotic infections. Although conﬁrmed cases of human infections with inﬂuenza D virus have not been reported, the public health risks of this virus should be assessed.
At present, there are no antiviral drugs approved for inﬂuenza C or D virus infections, although antivirals are widely used for the treatment or prophylaxis of inﬂuenza A and B virus infections. Since the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is highly conserved among inﬂuenza A, B, C, and D viruses, RNA polymerase inhibitors, such as baloxavir and favipiravir, may be active against inﬂuenza C and D viruses. Baloxavir was approved for the treatment of inﬂuenza A and B virus infections in Japan and the USA in 2018 and has since been approved in several other countries; favipiravir was approved for inﬂuenza pandemic preparedness in Japan in 2014 and stockpiled for use against novel inﬂuenza virus infections for which ﬁrst-line antivirals are ineffective [1]. Inﬂuenza A viruses are known to be more susceptible to baloxavir than inﬂuenza B viruses [3,16,30]. In this study, we found that all inﬂuenza C and D viruses tested had IC50 values comparable to or lower than the reference wild-type A and B viruses for baloxavir. These results suggest that baloxavir could be a potential drug for the treatment of inﬂuenza C and D virus infections. Clinical data on the efﬁcacy of this drug in patients infected with inﬂuenza C and D viruses are needed in the future.
Baloxavir acid, an active form of baloxavir marboxil, forms van der Waals interactions with A20, Y24, K34, A37, and I38 in inﬂuenza A virus or with T20, F24, M34, N37, and I38 in inﬂuenza B virus in the PA endonuclease domain [3]. Although the structure of the P3 endonuclease domain of inﬂuenza C and D viruses co-crystalized with baloxavir acid has not been analyzed, amino acid differences at these positions may be related to the lower baloxavir susceptibilities: I20, A24, K34, Q37, and I38 in inﬂuenza C virus or I20, V24, T34, S37, and V38 in inﬂuenza D virus. In fact, the I38V substitution was recently reported to be associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir [9]. In vitro studies to identify amino acid substitutions associated with RNA inhibitor resistance in inﬂuenza C and D viruses may be useful for understanding the differences in IC50 values among inﬂuenza A, B, C, and D viruses.
The WHO-AVWG has been conducting global analysis of antiviral susceptibilities of circulating inﬂuenza A and B viruses since 2012–2013 period [9]. To determine the baloxavir and favipiravir susceptibilities of inﬂuenza C and D viruses, we applied the focus reduction assay we use for our global and nationwide monitoring of the inﬂuenza A and B viruses to inﬂuenza C and D viruses. Using a combination of this focus reduction assay and a genotypic assay to detect amino acid substitutions associated with antiviral resistance has proven valuable for monitoring the antiviral susceptibilities of inﬂuenza C and D viruses. Recently, a tentative new lineage of inﬂuenza D viruses (the D/Bursa2013 lineage) was detected in cattle in Turkey [55]. Monitoring of the antiviral susceptibilities of inﬂuenza viruses should continue in order to assess the public health risks posed by these viruses.
