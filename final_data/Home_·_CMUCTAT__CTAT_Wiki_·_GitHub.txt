Web-based Reimplementation Available

December 4, 2023 - We are completing a reimplementation of CTAT as a web application, and we recommend that both novice and experienced CTAT authors switch to using the new tools. Please contact us at tutorshop-support to request access.

CTAT 4.4.0 Released

July 16, 2020 - This release supports cognitive tutors whose production rule engines run client-side, in the student's browser, instead of on a remote server. As a result, use of rule-based tutors is no longer constrained by server capacity.

The new production rule system is described on this page: JavaScript Model Tracer .

Improved support for collaborative tutors deployed from Tutorshop.

Various fixes.

CTAT 4.3.0 Released

June 30, 2017 - This release includes a few new features in support of HTML tutor interfaces, as well as several fixes. Changes include:

Support for collaboration with HTML tutors.

New actions for HTML components that allow adding and removing CSS classes through tutor-performed steps.

Various fixes in the Authoring Tools, HTML components, and the JavaScript example tracer.

Read more in the release notes . Download the latest release of CTAT here .

CTAT documentation moved

May 10, 2017 - All new documentation for the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools is now on this GitHub site.

Note: Some older documentation for Java and Flash tutors is still available on the old CTAT web site .

CTAT 4.2.0 Released

January 19, 2017 - CTAT 4.2.0 supports our new CTAT HTML Editor, which allows users to quickly build tutor interfaces. Changes include:

Support for connecting the authoring tools to the web-based CTAT HTML Editor.
