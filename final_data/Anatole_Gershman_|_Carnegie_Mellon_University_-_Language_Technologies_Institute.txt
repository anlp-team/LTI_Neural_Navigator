Anatole Gershman

Distinguished Service Professor

Research Interests:

Information Extraction, Summarization and Question Answering

My research focuses on automatic information extraction from text and speech. In particular, I am exploring two aspects of information extraction:

Interactive Learning : This work focuses on extending automatic extraction capabilities to new domains through interactions between a teacher and the system.

Information Integration : We're integrating extracted information into a probabilistic knowledge base using probabilistic reasoning.
