Introduction
Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, a graduate department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. You have joined a Ph.D. program that focuses on excellence, creativity, and training the next generation of research leaders. While the next few years will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI will also be rewarding professionally and personally.
Obtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work-life balance helps to keep it in perspective. Carnegie Mellon is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor heritage. In the past, it was the heart of the U.S. steel industry, a source for quality packaged foods, an important financial hub, and an early pioneer in railroads, radio, and nuclear power. This is a city where people worked hard and made things that changed the world. Today, Pittsburgh has reinvented itself as a leader in Computer Science and medicine, but it is still a place where people work hard and make things that change the world. It is also an informal city, where people don’t take themselves too seriously and remember to have fun. It is home to excellent museums, competitive professional sports teams, inexpensive magic shows, and free music during the summer, with skiing and magnificent state parks nearby. Your stay here will be more rewarding if you make time for exploring the many activities that Pittsburgh and Southwest Pennsylvania have to offer.
There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to standard information. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies. All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies. For information about Carnegie Mellon requirements and policies, please see the university’s handbook The Word, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs web page, the Office of the Dean of Students web page, and other resources contained in Appendix A of this handbook.
Welcome! We hope that your time here is a life-changing experience.

1.6 The Carnegie Mellon Code
Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical, and moral conduct possible.
These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.
The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.
The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.
The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found here: https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/.
2 The Language Technologies Institute
2.1 Pittsburgh Campus Location
The Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5th and 6th floors of the Gates Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus. The address and contact information of the LTI are shown below.
Language Technologies Institute Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue Gates Hillman Complex Pittsburgh, PA 15241-3891
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 12


412-268-6298 (fax) http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/
Office locations for faculty, staff, and Ph.D. students can be found on the LTI website.
2.2 Office Space
Most Ph.D. students in residence on the Pittsburgh campus are given an office in which to study and do research. Typically, offices are shared with other Ph.D. students, but they may also be shared with staff, visitors, or other members of the LTI.
Offices are assigned by the LTI’s Office Manager (see Section 1.2, Department Personnel, for contact information).
2.3 Mailboxes and Office Supplies
Mailboxes and office supplies are in GHC 5404.
2.4 Photocopies and Printers
Printers and photocopies are available to LTI students. The use of a photocopier or printer requires you to log in with your CMU ID card. LTI students may use printers/photocopiers scattered throughout the School of Computer Science buildings, but the machines in GHC 5404 and GHC 6604 are the most convenient. The SCS Computing Facilities publishes a list of printers online at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printer-list.
2.5 Computers for LTI Ph.D. Students
Ph.D. students are responsible for having their own laptop computers to support their education and research. Students are free to choose their own operating system (e.g., Linux, MacOs, Windows).
Many Ph.D. advisors also provide access to computer clusters, cloud computing, or other resources to support computationally-intense research.
Ph.D. students are given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or capstone projects. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.
Ph.D. students receive two types of user ids: An Andrew id and a CS id. All CMU students have an Andrew id. Computer Science students also have a CS id that provides access to SCS-specific resources (e.g., computer clusters). CS ids are being phased out very slowly, so it is likely that you will need both types of user id.

Standard Degree Requirements & Degree Certification
3.1
LTI Ph.D. Degree Requirements
To complete the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must satisfy the following requirements:
Pass at least 96 units of graduate level courses, with additional requirements detailed below;
Satisfy proficiencies in Writing, Presentation, Programming, and Teaching; • Propose, write, and defend a Ph.D. dissertation (thesis); • Attend the LTI Colloquium (11-700) each semester; and • Satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement.
The sections below provide more detail about each of these requirements.
3.1.1 Course Requirements
To complete the course requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must pass 96 or more course units of graduate courses, and meet the following criteria:
At least 72 units of “LTI” courses and 24 units of “SCS” courses, • At least one class in each “LTI Focus Area”, and • At least two labs, in two different research areas.
For definitions of quoted terms, see the section on “Definitions of LTI Terminology”.
Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.
An “LTI course” is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with 11-XXX counts as one-half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI allows any one MLD (10-XXX) graduate course to count as an "LTI course".
An “SCS course” is any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6-unit course with such a number counts as one-half of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended electives that are technically
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 14


outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Digital Signal Processing in ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as “SCS.”
“LTI Focus Areas” are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under “Course Categories.” If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should make a request to the Ph.D. Program Director. They will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area. If approved, it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage.
A “Task-Orientation Focus Course” is a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on the LTI’s “Course Categories” webpage.
An LTI “lab course” is a course in the list of lab courses defined on the LTI’s “Course Categories” webpage.
3.1.2 Grade Requirements
Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed study by satisfying the following grade requirements.
Minimum grade: Only courses with a grade of B (3.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree requirement.
Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement.
3.1.3 Proficiency Requirements
The LTI Ph.D. does not require any Qualifying Exams. Instead, a LTI Ph.D. student is required to demonstrate proficiency in the following four areas.
Writing: This is satisfied by producing a peer-reviewed conference paper, or the equivalent (a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference- paper quality).
Presentation: This is satisfied by the oral presentation of a conference paper, or the equivalent (an oral presentation that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference-talk quality).
Programming: This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming of language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research and/or project work.
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 15


Teaching: This is satisfied by two (2) successful Teaching Assistantships (TA-ships), as determined by the faculty member for whom the student serves as TA. Typically, one of these will be for an undergraduate class, and one for a graduate-level class. One of the two TA-ships may be in some form of pre-approved "alternate service", such as an SCS “v-unit.”
The Program Coordinator must be notified in advance of a TA-ship, or it may not be accepted.
Graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full university policy can be reviewed at:
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-instructors.html
The fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA.
In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory screening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the Student Academic Success Center website for additional information:
https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/
3.1.4 The Ph.D. Dissertation
The Ph.D. dissertation is the defining feature of a Ph.D. degree. The process of completing a Ph.D. dissertation has three important milestones.
Thesis Topic: During the Ph.D. student’s third year, the student should be working hard to find a thesis topic. The thesis topic typically develops from the directed research that the student has been carrying out with the student’s advisor. The topic is a well-defined research problem that is interesting and unsolved, and for which the student has a believable proposed solution. When the dissertation is finished, there will be a “thesis statement” that describes the claimed solution to the research problem that is the thesis topic.
Thesis Proposal: Near the end of the student’s third year, the student will compose a dissertation proposal. In this document, the student will specify the problem the research addresses (the thesis topic); the significance of the problem and expected scientific contributions; other relevant research, including competing approaches; some preliminary results; the work that still must be completed; evaluation metrics for that work; and a
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 16


projected timeline for completion. Before presenting the proposal, the student will also secure approval for a dissertation committee, which consists of the student’s advisor, at least two other SCS faculty members working in language technologies, and at least one external member.
University rules require that the time and place of the proposal presentation be publicly announced at least one week before the presentation. The student should coordinate this with the Ph.D. Program Coordinator. The public thesis proposal protects the student by guaranteeing that the proposed research is interesting to the larger scientific community and demonstrating that the student will finish the program if the work is completed as outlined.
Thesis Defense: The dissertation document itself, normally expected at the end of the fifth year, will include a detailed description of all the work done, including a clear evaluation and a discussion of its scientific contributions. There are no fixed style or document length guidelines or requirements; the only format requirement is that the title page should be suitable to be issued as an LTI Technical Report. The dissertation defense is a public presentation and defense of the dissertation results. Note: University rules again require that the time and place of the dissertation defense be publicly announced at least one week prior to the defense. This should also be coordinated with Ph.D. Program Coordinator.
Note: At the time of the public announcement, a draft of the thesis document must be made available online.
3.1.5 Research Speaking Requirement
To emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills and increase internal awareness of LTI work, all LTI Ph.D. students must complete an oral presentation at the LTI each year (by the end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20-minute talk plus time for discussion. It must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the public will be invited. (The thesis proposal and defense each count towards this requirement.)
At least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor. After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery.
3.2 Advising
Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 17


study projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.
How and when the advisor is selected (The Matching Process): Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation lectures, (Section 3.3) in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a first, second and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a "Matching Committee" to determine the best set of matches.
Until a student finds a specific advisor, the Program Director of the LTI graduate programs serves as the advisor.
How to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem (assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time.
3.3 LTI Orientation
At the beginning of each Fall semester, the LTI provides 2-3 weeks of lectures and talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and treat them as seriously as a standard course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however, the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.
For many years, these talks were called "the Immigration Course (IC)." The intuition behind this name is that the talks help orient newly-arrived students – immigrants into the CMU environment. As a result, some students understood the name to indicate that the talks would be about US immigration and visa requirements. The older name has been retired; however, people who have been at CMU a long time may occasionally use the older name.
3.4 End of Semester Evaluation
Near the end of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes his or her achievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester.
At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from

Page 18


the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degree.
A good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual.
If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent "black mark" on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.
In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an “N-1” letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.
3.5 Electives Outside of SCS
Students may take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross-registered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requirements of their program as described above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor. Typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses.
Students interested in taking recommended electives outside the SCS should pay particular attention to the following issues.
Recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the “SCS” course requirement. Please see the Program Director for approval of an elective as an “SCS course”.
Students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., summer courses).
The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (“B” is the minimum for Ph.D.).
3.6 Completing an M.S. Degree Enroute to a Ph.D.
Courses that satisfy LTI Ph.D. degree requirements may also be used to satisfy requirements for one M.S. degree. The most common choice is the LTI’s Master of Language Technologies (MLT) degree because its requirements are similar (but not identical) to the Ph.D. requirements. Other M.S. degrees within the LTI and outside of the LTI are also possible.
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 19


Students interested in an M.S. degree other than the MLT degree should discuss their plans with their Ph.D. advisor due to the additional courses and project work that may be involved.
3.7 Grading and Evaluation
3.7.1 University Policy on Grades
Carnegie Mellon’s Grading policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.
Process for Appealing Final Grades
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit, or program.
Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university policy.
See the university’s Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures web page information. https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of- for more grades-and-academic-actions.html
3.7.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit- evaluation-and-assignment.html
Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations.
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 20


3.8 Academic Integrity
In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.
Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society.
Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: To create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society; to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem- solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.
In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.
Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity.
The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures is also recommended.
Important note: The LTI implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.” Our procedure is as follows: A first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide not to immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation.
If the student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.
These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.
Please see the Appeals of Course Level Action section of The Word and the Office of Community Standards & Integrity web page for more information.
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 21


3.9 Withdrawal of a Degree
The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. See the university’s Withdrawal of a Degree policy for more information.
3.10 Employment Eligibility Verification
If you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf] covering the university’s I-9 and E-Verify requirements:
Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment.

Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required.
For more information, please see CMU’s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E- Verify Requirements at CMU [pdf], or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9.
Students who fail to complete the Form I-9 in a timely manner may have stipend payments suspended. If employed by the university, an individual who fails to timely complete the Form I-9 may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
For more information:
See CMU’s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU, or
Visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9.”
3.11 Additional Guidance for Students
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 22


3.11.1 Program of Study
Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.
3.11.2 Financial Aid and Student Account
Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.)
Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than-standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master’s degree programs.
3.11.3 International Students
Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.
4
Ph.D. Academic Policies
4.1 Duration of Study
The target duration of the LTI Ph.D. is five years, although six years is also common.
Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in this Graduate Student Handbook. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.
Early Completion The Ph.D. is granted when all degree requirements are satisfied. Some students complete the program in fewer than five years.
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 23


Extended or Longer-than-Standard Competition Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.
Doctoral students who require an extended period to complete their degree requirements must consult with their academic program and are subject to the CMU Policy on Doctoral Student Status (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/doctoral-student-status.html), specifically the “Time to Degree.”
4.1.1 Department Policy on Double Counting Courses
An LTI Ph.D. student who uses courses taken as a Master’s degree student (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other Master’s degree offered by the school. The LTI (like other SCS units) allows its Ph.D. students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master’s degree to receive the master’s degree without any additional work. Any other sharing of coursework by an LTI student between more than one CMU degree (e.g., receiving an MLD Master’s degree that includes courses taken as an LTI Ph.D. student) must be explicitly approved by the LTI, on a case-by-case basis, in advance.
4.1.2 External Internships
The LTI provides summer support for its Ph.D. students, so Ph.D. students are expected to do research at Carnegie Mellon during the summer. However, outside experience can be a valuable educational experience, Ph.D. students in good standing are allowed to do an external internship. Some students may benefit from more than one internship, especially if they require access to proprietary data for their work, thus, with the approval of the student’s advisor, a student can intern up to four (4) times during their Ph.D. degree. Interning more than four (4) times requires approval from the Ph.D. Program Director.
Any internship must be planned in consultation with the student’s advisor and the LTI Ph.D. Coordinator. If an internship is part of a fully-funded external fellowship (e.g., Microsoft Research Fellowship), the student does not need prior LTI approval, but should still coordinate with their advisor. International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract.
Internships are typically scheduled during the summer. In certain cases, it is possible to schedule an internship during the fall or spring semester; the details are complex, especially for international students, so the student should discuss this as early as possible with the Ph.D. Program Director. International students must coordinate carefully with the LTI in any event, due to visa restrictions.
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 24


Note that self-funded Ph.D. students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester internship) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while full-time LTI-sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend.
All students are cautioned to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas.
If the student is to receive academic credit for the internship, it must have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units, they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc.
4.1.3 Maximum Courseload
Ph.D. students are permitted to register for a maximum of 54 units of coursework per semester.
4.1.4 Pass/Fail Grades
Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement.
Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.
4.1.5 Transfer Credit
An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the Ph.D. course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the Ph.D. Program Director.
Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student’s transcript to make the decision.
See the section on “Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption.”
A student may not receive transfer credit for more than four courses.
4.1.6 Residency Requirements
The university requires Ph.D.s to spend at least one year of residency at Carnegie Mellon.
The SCS requires that all Ph.D. students must take at Carnegie Mellon a minimum of 48 units of the total coursework required by their respective programs.
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 25


4.1.7 Transferring Into the Ph.D. Program
The LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master’s programs into its Ph.D. program. The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time. However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities.
4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program
The Ph.D. program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.
4.2 LTI Academic Policies
4.2.1 “Grandfather” Policy
A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.
4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption
The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program.
If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place.
If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.
4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting
Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to work primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE); otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status. See also External Internships.
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 26


4.2.4 Leave of Absence
The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Ph.D. Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.
Students taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university’s leave of absence process.
4.2.5 Satisfactory Progress
If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove them from the program. See section on “End of Semester Evaluation.”
4.2.6 Time Away from Academic Responsibilities
Ph.D. students that are supported by sponsored research, fellowships, or scholarships are expected to remain on campus and work fulltime on their education and research throughout the year, regardless of whether classes are in session or not. 40 hours per week is a common level of effort.
Ordinarily, students are not expected to work during official university holidays, however students may need to consult their advisor about expectations and alternate arrangements if there are challenges with taking time off during a university holiday, for example, if an experiment requires continuous monitoring. In such situations, the student and their advisor may agree for the student to take an equal number of days off at another time.
Students with fulltime financial support are entitled to four weeks per year of paid vacation, which must be scheduled in consultation with their advisor.
4.3 CMU Academic Policies
4.3.1 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures
Add, drop, withdrawals, and pass/no pass election procedures and deadlines are described on a Hub web page. Note that the deadlines for doctoral courses may differ slightly; see the deadlines for doctoral course sections in the Academic Calendar.
Doctoral students, visiting/non-degree students, and certificate students do not receive vouchers and do not participate in the voucher process.
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 27


4.3.2 Doctoral Student Status
Carnegie Mellon’s Policy for Doctoral Student Status covers time limits on doctoral degree student status, a definition of All But Dissertation status, a definition of In Residence (ABD) and In Absentia (ABS) status for doctoral students and the tuition and fees charged for students In Residence and students In Absentia.
4.3.3 ABD versus ABD in Absentia (ABS)
Following university policy, an LTI Ph.D. student is considered "All-But-Dissertation" (ABD) when they have completed all requirements for the LTI's Ph.D. degree except for the thesis defense (in particular, the student has had a thesis proposal accepted). Note that ABD status is different from ABD in absentia (ABS) status. A student in ABS status cannot receive any support from the university (including any research projects within the university), cannot use most university facilities, and does not pay any tuition until they are ready to defend their thesis. ABS students must register for five (5) units of dissertation research in the semester they defend; in keeping with university policy, the LTI (and its projects and faculty) cannot pay for these five units. The student can (and should) register for these five units only after they defend; just in case the defense date slips to the next semester.
Students entering ABD or ABS status must complete the All But Dissertations Status Agreement.
4.3.4 Statute of Limitations: Time to Degree
As outlined in the Doctoral Student Status Policy, students will complete all requirements for the Ph.D. degree within a maximum of ten years from original matriculation as a doctoral student, or less if required by a more restrictive department or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a doctoral degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered doctoral degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department’s recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption.

Students, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.
4.3.5 University Financial Aid
Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website. Students will find the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links.
4.3.6 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities
The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability Resources' secure online portal (https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/) or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process. Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about to access@andrew.cmu.edu , or call (412) 268-6121.
the process can be directed
4.3.7 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures
Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program.
4.3.8 Sexual Misconduct Policy
The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence, and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith.
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook

4.3.9 Gestational and Parental Accommodations
Providing holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols described at https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families.
Students seeking any of the Parental Accommodations described below must register with the Office of the Dean of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling 412- 268-2075.
Students are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstance. At the time of registering, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, procedures, funding options and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with the student’s academic department. Students should also consult with their academic advisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of Students.
4.3.10 Accommodations for Gestational Parents
The birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic pursuits for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away from their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two options as possible accommodation:
Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents – A short term absence from academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks. Short-Term Accommodation
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 30


may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, where a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include extensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping courses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a Short-Term Accommodation will remain enrolled.
Formal Leave of Absence– A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave Policy. Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full- semester, mini-semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the leave is Absence (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html) drop all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for the semester. International students must Education (https://www.cmu.edu/oie/) before considering this option due to visa implications. a
taken.
4.3.11 Parental Accommodation for Doctoral Students
The university offers a Parental Accommodation for qualifying doctoral student parents to include up to four (4) weeks of time away from academic responsibilities with continued stipend support. This accommodation can be utilized within six months of the birth or placement of a child through adoption, foster care or legal guardianship. Gestational parents may utilize both the Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents and the parental accommodation.
Careful planning and consultation is necessary given the unique contexts and requirements of each student’s situation. Students will remain fully enrolled and will receive assistance in navigating the necessary planning and consultation processes.
4.3.12 Financial Assistance for Student Parents
Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who become parents while enrolled:
Interest Free Loan – Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest- free parental loan (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/) from the Office of the Dean of Students.
Doctoral Stipend Continuation (Gestational Parents) – Doctoral students who are the gestational parent and who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) weeks during a Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents or during a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 31


academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six weeks is medically necessary.
Doctoral Stipend Continuation (Non-gestational Parents) – Doctoral students who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon and are becoming a parent by adoption, birth, or through guardianship are eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to four (4) weeks during a Short-Term Parental Accommodation.

Financial Support
5.1 Graduate Student Funding
For all LTI Ph.D. students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year. This support is normally continued for at least 5 years, with possibility of further continuance, subject to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition and fees, and a monthly Ph.D. stipend that is fixed across SCS. In addition, the LTI pays a dependency allowance of 10% of the student's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless they have a spouse who earns more than $200 per month.
The impact of outside fellowships and scholarships on departmental support-decrease by the amount, added bonus, etc.
If a Ph.D. student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is expected to accept it in place of the LTI’s graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, the LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined stipend 10 percent higher than that of the standard LTI graduate fellowship.
Students are required to inform the LTI about any external funding that they receive.
See also the section on “ABD versus ABD in Absentia (ABS)” (Section 4.3.3).
5.2 Conference Travel Funding
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook
Page 32


Students funded by research projects receive travel funding according to policies set by the individual projects. Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding, with a larger amount available for travel to present a refereed conference paper. There is an LTI form that must be filled out in advance.
5.3 Research Funding
GuSH Research Funding is a source of small research grant funds provided by the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) and the Provost’s Office and managed by the Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs. See the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs Research Grant Support page for information about the application process and deadlines.
5.4 Office of the Dean of Students Emergency Support Funding
Graduate students who find themselves in need of immediate funds for emergency situations should contact the Office of the Dean of Students. All students, regardless of their program, are eligible for the Emergency Student Loan, which is an interest-free and emergency-based loan repayable within 30 days. It is available through the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs; students may apply for the loan by visiting the Office of the Dean of Students, located in Warner Hall 321 during business hours, by email at sa-esl@andrew.cmu.edu or by calling (412) 268-2075 for an appointment.
5.5 Health Insurance
Carnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree seeking students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered by the University or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is “enrolled as the dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance plan.”(See the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy (SHIP)).
It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester or elect a payment plan over the course of the academic year. More information is available at the Student Health Services Web site.
