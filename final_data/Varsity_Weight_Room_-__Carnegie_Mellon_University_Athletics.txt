With the renovations to Skibo Gym and the new Highmark Center for Health, Wellness and Athletics being constructed over the next three years, the strength and conditioning facility has been relocated.

A fully equiped facility has been temporarily placed on the lawn next to the outdoor basketball court close to the Donner lockerrooms, Gesling Stadium, and Wiegand Gymnasium.

Inside the climate controlled tent you'll find state of the art equipment ranging from the makers of Hammer Strength, Life Fitness, and ProStar.
