Introduction
1.1 Welcome
Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute. While this handbook (and your college graduate student handbook) is specific to your academic experience in the LTI, there are several other resources and offices that graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, the student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, and others, are included in Appendix A of this handbook.
1.2 The MLT Degree
The Master of Language Technologies (MLT) is a research-oriented Master of Science degree offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MLT program is a 24-month program consisting of courses, directed research, and an optional Masters' Thesis. Typical research areas include speech processing, information retrieval, machine translation, natural language processing, machine learning, and computational biology. Many MLT graduates continue on to PhD programs in the LTI or other leading universities. Other graduates go on to work in the computer industry, many at major corporate research laboratories.
There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to the standard information outlined below. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Master of Language Technologies (MLT) degree.
While this handbook is specific to your academic experience in the department, there are several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook, the Office of the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are included in Appendix A of this handbook.

1.6 The Carnegie Mellon Code
Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct possible.
These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.
The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.
The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.
The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at http://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/code.html
1.7 Vision
Carnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society through continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship.
MLT Graduate Student Handbook

1.8 Mission
To create a transformative educational experience for students focused on deep disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-being.
To cultivate a transformative university community dedicated to a) attracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential.
To impact society in a transformative way—regionally, nationally, and globally—by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the university campus.
1.9 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate
Students
This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual, or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.

2.3 Office Space for MS Students
To help them create a sense of community, full time students in the LTI’s MLT program have access to a shared office space.
2.4 Computers for MS Students
Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access university resources and complete course assignments. Laptops running Windows, MacOS, and Linux software are all acceptable.
MS students will be given a CS user ID. A CS user ID is required to use the LTI computer cluster, department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science has a Help Center located at 4203 GHC. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu, extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line.
MS students will be given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or capstone projects. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.
3 Master’s Degree Completion and Certification
3.1 Standard Degree Requirements and Degree Certification
3.1.1 Graduate Students
Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary significantly-- ranging from two semesters for some full-time master’s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.
3.1.2 Early Completion
Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances.
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 11


3.1.3 Extended or Longer-than-Standard Completion (Statute of Limitations)
Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.
Master’s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program, and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. Students shall reference CMU Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations (www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of limitations.html) regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time allowable for master’s degree completion and certification.
3.1.4 Additional Guidance for Students
Program of Study: Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.
Financial Aid and Student Account: Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master’s degree programs. International Students: Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.

MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 12


4 MLT Degree Attainment
4.1 Course Requirements
In order to complete the Master of Language Technologies degree, the student must pass 120 or more course units of senior-to-graduate courses, and meet the following criteria:
within those 120 units, at least 72 units of “LTI” courses and 24 units of “SCS” courses, • within those 72 units, 11-711, 11-791 (or an equivalent, see below), and one ``Task Orientation Focus'' class, and
within those 72 units, at least one of the following: o an LTI lab course, o 11-792, or o project-oriented Masters’ thesis;
Of the remaining 24 units, 12 must be 11-910 Directed Research; • The final 12 units are an Open Elective.
The student must also complete two summers of full-time directed research, attend the LTI Colloquium (11-700) each semester, and satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement described elsewhere.
Since 11-791 is not being offered currently, the faculty have defined a list of acceptable substitute courses:
11-727: Computational Semantics for NLP (only if the course project was done as a group project)
11-731: Machine Translation • 11-747: Neural Networks for NLP • 11-751: Speech Recognition • 11-775: Large-Scale Multimedia • 11-776: Multimodal Affective Computing • 11-777: Multimodal Machine Learning • 11-785: Deep Learning • 11-797: Question Answering
Students may request to have other LTI courses with a group engineering project component to be added to this list.
For definitions of quoted terms, see the section on “Definitions of LTI Terminology.”
Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 13


Note that a Masters’ Thesis is not required in general, although a thesis project may be used to satisfy the “lab” requirement.
4.1.1 Grade Requirements
Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed study by satisfying the following grade requirements:
1. Minimum grade: Only courses with a grade of C (2.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree requirement.
2. Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement.
4.1.2 Research Speaking Requirement
To emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills, and increase internal awareness of LTI work, all MLT students must complete an oral presentation in their second year (by the end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20-minute talk plus time for discussion. It must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the public will be invited.
At least two CMU faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor. After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the chair of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery.
4.1.3 Withdrawal of a Degree
The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html.
4.2 Advising
Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed study projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 14


How and when the advisor is selected: the Marriage Process: Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (“Immigration Course,” or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a first, second, and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take, and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a “Marriage Committee” to determine the best set of matches.
Some entering MLT students are prefunded, meaning they have received and accepted a funding letter from a faculty member before the Marriage Process. (Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI’s research projects.) Even self-supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty advisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate programs serves as the advisor.
How to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem (assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time.
4.3 Optional Masters’ Thesis
MLT students may optionally elect to complete a Masters’ Thesis; it is not required. Students who intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several ways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in a research project or class project work.
The MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the October 31 proposal deadline!
There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. Thesis: 11-928 – Masters’ Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units, typically in the Fall of their second year) and 11-929 – Masters’ Thesis II in the following Spring.
Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT-level LTI course credit; if the student goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11-929) counts towards one PhD lab requirement.
The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their advisor to define an interesting but bounded thesis research project. The MLT thesis culminates in
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 15


a publication-quality paper that clearly describes the work in terms of its research significance.
The MLT thesis committee will be composed of a thesis advisor and two additional readers, to be chosen by the student in consultation with the advisor, during the Fall Masters’ Thesis I course. At least 2 of the 3 committee members must be SCS faculty working in Language Technologies.
To receive a final grade for the first semester's course, the student must have prepared
a written proposal of at least five pages, describing the scientific thesis to be investigated, any relevant research already completed by the student, a comparison with related work by others, and a detailed description of the work to be done in the next semester. The proposal MUST be accepted by the committee by the end of October, or the student will not be allowed to enroll in 11-929 – Masters’ Thesis II! • Sometime during the semester when the student enrolls in 11-929 – Masters’ Thesis II (typically, their final semester), the student will distribute a draft of the thesis to the committee for initial review. This should be done as early as feasible, to avoid last- minute surprises that could delay final approval of the thesis.
The thesis work culminates in submission of the final version of the thesis document, followed by a public presentation of the work in an LTI seminar (or other suitable public forum). Since the defense is public, the LTI graduate program administrator must receive all the information required for a public announcement at least one week before the defense. The Masters’ Thesis presentation is somewhat less rigorous than a PhD thesis defense. The presentation must communicate the research work done, similar to a conference paper presentation. The committee will observe the presentation, and then decide whether the thesis and presentation were acceptable, or whether further work is required. Unlike a PhD defense, only a simple majority vote of the committee is required for approval.
Although students are required to enroll in the appropriate course sequence of two Masters’ Thesis courses, it is not required that students finish the thesis by the end of that second semester. If a student requires more time to revise the thesis to the committee's satisfaction, and adequately present the work, an incomplete grade will be assessed in the Masters’ Thesis course, until such time as the work and presentation are accepted. The student will still be allowed to walk in Spring Commencement, if all other requirements for the MLT degree have been completed. Students should note that any financial support beyond the end of the semester will be on a case-by-case basis, and must be arranged in advance with the project supporting them. Students are strongly encouraged to finish the thesis work within one (1) year following the semester they enroll for the first Masters’ Thesis course.

4.4 Definitions of LTI Terminology
We define here some of the terms as used in this handbook:
An “LTI course” is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with an 11-XXX counts as 1/2 of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that we will allow any one MLD (10-xxx) graduate-level course to count as an “LTI course.”
An “SCS course” is any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6-unit course with such a number counts as 1/2 of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended electives that are technically outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Digital Signal Processing in ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as “SCS.”
“LTI Focus Areas” are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under “Course Categories.” If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should notify the Chair of the LTI Graduate Programs. He will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area, and if approved it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage. Area, as listed on the “Course Categories” webpage.
An LTI “lab course” is simply a course in the list of lab courses defined in the LTI “Course Categories” webpage.
4.5 Recommended Electives outside of SCS
Students are free to take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross- registered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requirements of their program as described above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor; typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses.
Note: recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the “SCS” course requirement. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as “SCS.”
Note also that students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., summer courses). The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (“B-” is the minimum for PhD, “C” for MLT).
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 17


4.6 LTI Orientation
At the beginning of each Fall semester, the LTI provides a set of lectures and talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and treat them seriously, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however, the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.
For many years, these talks were called "the Immigration Course (IC)", which caused confusion. The older name has been retired; however, people who have been at CMU a long time may occasionally use the older name.
4.7 End of Semester Evaluation
Near the end of the spring and fall semesters, the student must prepare a statement that describes their achievements in the current semester, and plans for the next semester. At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degree.
A good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual.
If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent “black mark” on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.
In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.
4.8 Enrollment Verification
Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at: http://www.cmu.edu/hub/transcripts/verifications/enrollment.html.

4.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading
4.9.1 University Policy on Grades
ww.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.
4.9.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses
www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/TransferCredit.html Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors, or QPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college’s and department's policies allow this.)
4.10 Academic Integrity
Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity:
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html
The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeals process.
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html
In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 19


Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society; to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem- solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.
In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.
The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process. Please see https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/ for more information.
Important note: The LTI implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.” Our procedure is as follows: a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide not to immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation. If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.
5 Academic Policies
5.1 MLT Academic Policies
5.1.1 Duration of Study
MLT students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in two calendar years (24 months). This includes two summers of full-time directed research.
See also the “Statute of Limitations” policy.
5.1.2 Double-Dipping
A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 20


toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. This is an SCS-wide policy.
5.1.3 Pass/Fail Grades
Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.
5.1.4 Independent Study
For an Independent Study to satisfy an MLT student’s coursework requirements, it must be approved by the MLT Program Director in advance. In consultation with the CMU faculty member who will be supervising the Independent Study, the student should produce a short (half-page to one page) description of the goals of the Independent Study, and how the results will be evaluated, and submit it to the Program Director before the end of the Add period of the semester of the proposed study. The study should be planned so that it is finished in time for the supervising faculty member to give a grade at the end of the semester. Independent studies may be undertaken for 6 or 12 units. Normally only one Independent Study would be approved during a student’s MLT coursework.
5.1.5 Transfer Credit
An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the MLT course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the MLT Program Director. Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student’s transcript to make the decision.
See the section on “Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption.”
All MLT students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU.
5.1.6 External Internships
MLT students may only engage in internships if their advisors recommend it, since the program is 24 months, including summers. International students are required to consult with the Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract.
We caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas.
Important: See also section 4.2.3, External Employment/Consulting.
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 21


5.1.7 Transferring Into the MLT Program
Transfers into the MLT program are not permitted during a student’s first semester at CMU. Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them; this is a university policy.
Students may request to transfer into the MLT program after completing their first semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MLT/PhD Admissions Chair. The MLT/PhD Admissions Chair will inform the student about what application materials are required; for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. The MLT program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request.
5.1.8 Transferring Out of the MLT Program
The MLT program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MLT degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to request such a transfer.
5.1.9 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures
Students taking undergraduate and Masters’ level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, and withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course- changes.index. Please note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does not apply to Masters’ students.
5.1.10 Statute of Limitations
As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations, https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html. Students will complete all requirements for the masters’ degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a masters’ student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school, or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a masters’ degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered masters’ degree program under criteria determined by that program.
See also the ‘Duration of Study’ policy.
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 22


5.1.11 Teaching Requirements
MLT students do not normally serve as Teaching Assistants (TAs). If an MLT student wants to TA a course, they must get the approval of their research advisor.
In the unusual case of an MLT student TAing, note that graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full University policy can be reviewed at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency- instructors.html.
The fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA. In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory screening for all non-native speakers of English), Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the Student Academic Success Center website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/.
5.2 LTI Academic Policies
5.2.1 “Grandfather” policy
A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.
5.2.2 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption
The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the chair of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course, but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 23


5.2.3 External Employment/Consulting
Students funded by LTI research projects are normally expected to work exclusively for those projects. Since consulting may provide useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult, at most, one eight-hour day per seven-day week, only with the advisor's consent. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE); otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status.
Important: Any work for pay outside of the funding research project must be approved in advance by the advisor (and OIE, for international students). This includes paid TAing, consulting, online free-lancing, etc.
5.2.4 Leave of Absence
The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.
5.2.5 Satisfactory Progress
If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on “End of Semester Evaluation.”
5.2.6 Winter and Summer Breaks
Students supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is typically allowed in the summer. The normal winter break policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks, and takes vacation for the other two weeks.
5.3 CMU Academic Policies
5.3.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities
http://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources
The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the Carnegie Mellon community. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 24


the process through Disability Resources’ secure online portal or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process.
Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self- identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu or call 412-268-6121.
5.3.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures
https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html
Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program.
5.3.3 Process for Appealing Final Grades
https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and academic- actions.html Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit, or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor, and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal:
a) The final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam)
b) The faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of
University policy.
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 25


5.3.4 Safeguarding Educational Equity: Sexual Misconduct Policy
The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence, and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith. The University’s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and- governance/sexual-misconduct/index.html. The University’s Policy Against Retaliation is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html. If you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources:
Office of Title IX Initiatives, https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/ 412-268-7125, tix@cmu.edu
University Police, 412-268-2323
Additional resources and information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources- and-information/resources.html.
5.3.5 Gestational and Parental Accommodation
https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation protocol.html
Providing holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols on this page are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families.
Students seeking any of the parental accommodations described below must register with the Office of the Dean of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling 412- 268-2075.
Students are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstances. At the time of registration, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, procedures, funding options, and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with the student’s academic department. Students should also consult with their academic advisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of Students.
Accommodations for Gestational Parents The birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic pursuits for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away from their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two options as a possible accommodation:
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 26


Short-term accommodation for gestational parents – A short-term absence from academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks. Short term accommodations may be extended by two (2) weeks for a total of eight (8) weeks, where a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include extensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping courses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a short-term accommodation will remain enrolled.
Formal Leave of Absence - A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave Policy. Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full-semester, mini-semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the leave is taken. Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student- leave.html) drop all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for the semester. International students must consult with the Office of International Education (https://www.cmu.edu/oie/) before considering this option due to visa implications.
Financial Assistance for Student Parents Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who become parents while enrolled:
Interest-free Loan – Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest-free parental loan (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/) from the Office of the Dean of Students.
6 Financial Issues
6.1 Graduate Student Funding
For all LTI MLT students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year. This support is normally continued for the duration of the program, subject to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition and fees, and a monthly MLT stipend. In addition, the LTI pays a dependency allowance of 10% of the student's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless they have a spouse who earns more than $200 per month.
If an MLT student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is expected to accept it in place of the LTI’s graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, the LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 27


stipend 10 percent higher than that of the standard LTI graduate fellowship. Students are required to inform the LTI about any external funding that they receive.
6.2 University Financial Aid
Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website: http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/graduate/index.html.
6.3 Conference Travel Funding
Students funded by a research project receive travel funding according to policies set by the individual projects. Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding, with a larger amount available for travel to present a refereed conference paper. There is an LTI form that must be filled out in advance.
6.4 Office of the Dean of Students Emergency Support Funding
Graduate students who find themselves in need of immediate funds for emergency situations should contact the Office of the Dean of Students (see Appendix A), www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/index.html, to inquire about the types of emergency funding available to enrolled students.
6.5 Health Insurance
Carnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree-seeking students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered by the University, or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is “enrolled as the dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance plan” (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/StudentInsurance).
The LTI does not cover student health insurance, regardless of the students’ funding situation. It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester, or elect a payment plan over the course of the academic year. More information is available at the Student Health Services Web site www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/HealthServices/insurance.
MLT Graduate Student Handbook
Page 28


6.6 Emergency Loans
http://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/index.html All students, regardless of their program, are eligible for the Emergency Student Loan, which is an interest-free and emergency-based loan repayable within 30 days. It is available through the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs; students may apply for the loan by stopping in to the Student Affairs Office, Warner Hall 301, or by calling (412) 268-2075 for an appointment.
6.7 Employment Eligibility Verification
If you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf] covering the university’s I-9 and E-Verify requirements:
Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU

must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment. Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required.
For more information, please see CMU’s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU [pdf], or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9.
Students who fail to complete the Form I-9 in a timely manner may have stipend payments suspended. If employed by the university, an individual who fails to timely complete the Form I-9 may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

7.5 Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/CrossRegister.html
Cross-registration provides an opportunity for enriched educational programs by permitting full-time graduate students to cross-register for courses (usually no more than one per semester) at a Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) Institution. Full-time Carnegie Mellon degree students are eligible and the PCHE course may not count towards full-time status unless the student is enrolled in an inter-university program. Students interested in taking advantage of this opportunity should be familiar with the Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses already outlined previously in this handbook.
Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college and department policies allow this.
7.6 Student Privacy Rights and FERPA
www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/StPrivacy.html This university policy notifies students of their rights under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). According to FERPA, students have the right to:
•
inspect and review their education records; request an amendment to their education record if they believe they are inaccurate or misleading; request a hearing if their request for an amendment is not resolved to their satisfaction;
• consent to disclosure of personally identifiable information from their education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent; file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Family Policy Compliance Office if they believe their rights under FERPA have been violated.

For questions about Student Privacy Rights, FERPA or filing a complaint, contact John Papinchak, University Registrar, jp7p@andrew.cmu.edu, in Enrollment Services.
7.7 Academic Calendar
The official academic calendar is published by Enrollment Services. It is not uncommon for departments and colleges to have academic requirements that differ from or are in addition to those presented in the academic calendar provided to the campus community by Enrollment
MLT Graduate Student Handbook

Services. You may find the CMU academic calendar here: www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar.html. This provides information on deadlines including registration dates, class start dates, add/drop deadlines, and more.
7.8 Professional Development
The Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) (www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/career/index.html) at Carnegie Mellon is a centralized career center staffed by a team of seasoned and highly-educated professionals who orchestrate the career exploration, experiential learning, and career networking needs of students and alumni.
CMU's career and professional development model is grounded in discipline-specific career development, experiential learning, and employer relations shaped by strong connections with the university's seven academic colleges. The center's success is founded upon a solid understanding of career and professional development theory, integration of technology, and an unwavering commitment to providing personalized attention towards meeting the unique individual needs of students, alumni, and employers. The CDPC is located on the Lower Level of the University Center, 412-268-2064.
