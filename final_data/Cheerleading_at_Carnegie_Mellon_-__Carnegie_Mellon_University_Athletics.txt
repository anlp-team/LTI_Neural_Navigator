Cheerleading at Carnegie Mellon

The Carnegie Mellon Cheerleading Program is a sideline cheerleading and dance team that performs at home football games from September through November and home conference basketball games from January (after winter break) through February. There are no out-of-pocket expenses to participate in the Cheerleading Program; everything that is essential is provided by the athletics department.

The main goal of the cheerleading program is to provide spirit at games. Members of the team will use crowd-involving chants and cheers with signs and will perform dance routines and sideline dances. Additionally, the program will incorporate jumps, stunts, pyramids and basket tosses when appropriate, if applicable. All skills regardless of experience will be re-taught starting at the most basic level to ensure proper knowledge, technique, and safety.

We do our best to accommodate busy academic schedules as well as those of other activities. That is why we have incorporated a hybrid approach with the ability to use video instruction to learn new material and to review current material in order to limit the amount of face-to-face time commitment.

Join the Program!

The CMU Cheerleading Program welcomes all levels of experience to join! Former performers of any kind; dancers, gymnasts, figure skaters, cheerleaders, etc., or someone wanting to try something new and fun. Additionally, we welcome graduate students and semester exchange students from other CMU Campuses.
