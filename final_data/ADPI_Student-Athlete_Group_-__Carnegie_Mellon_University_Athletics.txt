ADPI Student-Athlete Group

With a student-athlete population of almost 30% Tartans identifying as ADPI, we bring diversity and change to athletics. Carnegie Mellon is a prestigious university where we value individual well-being and community support, and it’s important for all of our student-athletes to feel welcomed and supported by the environment that we create. To provide a safe space for Asians, Desis, and Pacific Islanders, we can come together to support each other’s cultures, improve the issues we face in competition, and celebrate who we are.
