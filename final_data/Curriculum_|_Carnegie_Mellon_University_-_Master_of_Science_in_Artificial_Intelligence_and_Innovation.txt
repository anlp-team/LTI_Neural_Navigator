Curriculum

To earn the MSAII degree, you must pass courses in the Core Curriculum, the Knowledge Requirements and Electives. You must also complete a capstone project in which you work on a development project as part of the Core Curriculum. In total, you will complete 195 eligible units of study, including 84 units of Core Curriculum (including the 36-unit Capstone), 72 units of Knowledge Requirements, at least 36 units of approved Electives and the LTI Practicum (3 units, associated with your summer internship). The purpose of the Core Curriculum is to prepare you to discover new AI applicants and develop them into a product suitable for further development, often leading to a startup enterprise.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the curriculum.

Preparation Prerequisite

Preparation Prerequisite

15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems .) Failure to pass the course means that you have to take 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester, and the units will not count toward your 192 eligible units of study.

This is a five-course sequence based on the four main phases of innovation development, including opportunity identification, opportunity development, business planning and incubation of a business with a viable product. The courses must be taken in the order listed:

11-651, Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (12 units). First fall semester. In this course, students are divided into teams to survey the fieild of AI applications, make presentations to the faculty and fellow students on areas that are ripe for AI development, and must develop a product proposal, which will be carried through for the next three semesters, leading to 11-699, the Capstone Project.

17-762, Law of Computer Technology (12 units). First fall semester. A review of legal principles applicable to computer developments, including AI law and formation of startups.

11-695, AI Engineering (12 units). First spring semester. This course is devoted to building deep learning applications using TensorFlow and Python. Topics include supervised learning, feed-forward neural networks, flow graphs, dynamic computational graphs, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Students will use high-level tools to engineer functioning machine learning models.

11-654, AI Innovation (12 units). Second fall semester. Students learn how to build an enterprise, either intrapreneurial or entrepreneurial, by developing a business model and strategy for their team's product.

11-699, Capstone Project (36 units). Second spring semester. The objective of the Capstone is for your team to develop a working product suitable for intrapreneurial integration into a company or suitable for startup investment.

11-601, Coding Bootcamp (12 units). First fall semester.

10-601, Machine Learning (12 units), First fall semester. (Normally 11-691, Math for Machine Learning, which is not being offered in Fall 2019.)

10-605, Machine Learning with Large Datasets (12 units). First spring semester.

11-611, Natural Language Processing (12 units). Second fall semester.

A 12-unit course in AI, NLP, or ML. Second fall semester.

11-785, Deep Learning (12 units). Second spring semester.

Internship

Every student is required to complete an industry internship during the summer between the first spring and second fall semesters. Every student must register for the internship - 11-934 (MSAII Practicum Internship). No tuition is charged for the internship.
