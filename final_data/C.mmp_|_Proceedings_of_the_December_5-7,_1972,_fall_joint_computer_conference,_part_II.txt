ABSTRACT

In the Summer of 1971 a project was initiated at CMU to design the hardware and software for a multi-processor computer system using minicomputer processors (i.e., PDP-11's). This paper briefly describes an overview (only) of the goals, design, and status of this hardware/software complex, and indicates some of the research problems raised and analytic problems solved in the course of its construction.
