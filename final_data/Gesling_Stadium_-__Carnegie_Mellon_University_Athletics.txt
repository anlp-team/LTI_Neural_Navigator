Gesling Stadium was built in 1990 as part of the east campus project which included the construction of two new dormitories located on the south end of the stadium and a 700 space parking garage attached at the north end. The playing surface was renovated with FieldTurf in the summer of 2006 and resurfaced and rebranded in the summer of 2014. The track was resurfaced in the summer of 2016. The stadium is home to the football team in the fall and the track and field team in the spring. The surface is an infill mix of silica sand and cryogenic rubber and a patented layering process that delivers a system that emulates natural grass. The seating capacity is 3,500 in the grandstands with multiple standing room viewing options available.

A state-of-the-art 13' x 24' video scoreboard was installed in 2019 for use by varsity athletics.
