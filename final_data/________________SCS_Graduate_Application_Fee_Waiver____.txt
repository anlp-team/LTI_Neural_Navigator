Waivers Related to Financial Hardship

If the application fee presents financial hardship to the applicant, we will consider a fee waiver request. If you are currently attending a U.S. based institution and feel that you are financially unable to pay, obtain a letter from your Financial Aid Office explaining your inability to pay and their support of a waiver. Upon receipt of this letter, your fee will be waived. If you are not a current student, are living outside of the U.S., or are unable to obtain a financial aid letter , include a brief description of your financial need and any documentation that supports your request (such as a tax return form, W2, etc.). Please do not include information about exchange rates, we are aware of those situations.

After submission we will confirm your need and waive the application fees for up to two programs.

Financial Fee Waiver Deadline

We will accept financial fee waiver requests starting on September 6, 2023 .

The final deadline to submit a financial fee waiver request is December 6, 2023 at 3 p.m. EST. We will not consider any late submissions by email.
