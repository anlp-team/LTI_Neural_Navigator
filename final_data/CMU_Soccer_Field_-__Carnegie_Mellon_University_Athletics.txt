The CMU Soccer Field was constructed in the summer of 2010 on what was an open-grass space widely used for intramurals and recreation. The transition to FieldTurf has created a spectacular playing venue for our varsity soccer teams while allowing a year-round space for the campus community. The field is adjacent to Gesling Stadium.

Included in the project was the relocation of the hammer/discus circle and shot put area used by the track and field teams, which now sit alongside the field. The lighted field allows for the continuation of evening soccer games and intramural and recreational activities.

There is a seating capacity for 250 people with standing room along the landscaped brick wall.
