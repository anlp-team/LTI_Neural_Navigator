Abstract: The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity and aerosol chemical composition were concurrently measured via a scanning mobility CCN analyzer (SMCA) and an Aerodyne Time- of-Flight Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM), respectively, during wintertime 2022 in Beijing, China. During the observation period, the mean CCN number concentrations ranged from 1345 ± 1270 cm−3 at SS = 0.1% to 3267 ± 2325 cm−3 at SS = 0.3%. The mean critical activation diameters (D50) at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were 172 ± 13 nm, 102 ± 8 nm, and 84 ± 7 nm, corresponding to the average hygroscopicity parameters (κCCN) of 0.34, 0.33, and 0.26, respectively. The diurnal variations in D50 suggested that the local primary emissions signiﬁcantly enhanced D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had less inﬂuence on D50 at SS = 0.1% due to the limited size (<150 nm) of particles emitted from primary sources. As PM2.5 concentration increases, the dominant driver of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. At a speciﬁc SS, D50 decreased with increases in the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal mixing degree during atmospheric aging was beneﬁcial to CCN activation. In this study, the commonly used f 44 (or O:C) was weakly correlated with κorg and failed to describe the variations in κorg. Instead, the variations in κorg can be well parameterized with the Org/BC ratio. The correlation between κ derived from bulk chemical compositions and CCN measurements was substantially improved when this κorg scheme was adopted, emphasizing the importance of considering κorg variations on deriving κchem from aerosol chemical composition.

Aerosol particles can serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) under supersaturation (SS) conditions [1,2], participating in cloud processes and altering the microphysical and optical properties of clouds, which indirectly affect the global climate [3,4]. The Sixth Assessment Report from IPCC (2021) highlighted that aerosol indirect effects remain the most considerable uncertainty in evaluating the anthropogenic contribution on current and future climate change [5]. Remote sensing has been widely used to study aerosol– cloud–climate interactions and provide extensive datasets. However, it is difﬁcult to identify the proportion of CCN from retrieved total aerosol concentration (CCN activation
4.0/).

ratio), which would introduce uncertainties in estimating aerosol-related effects on cloud microphysics based on remote sensing. Furthermore, accurate retrievals of cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd) using remote sensing measurements is challenging. Based on the ground-level measurements of aerosol activation properties and parcel theory, the Nd for non-precipitating Planetary Boundary Layer clouds can be derived. Then, the parameters of the retrieval can be optimized through the closure analysis on Nd obtained from remote sensing data and in situ measurement at ground level [6].
The ability of aerosol particles to participate in cloud processes, known as CCN activity, is one of critical parameters in studying the indirect radiation effects and environmental impacts of aerosols. At a given SS condition, the CCN activity is mainly determined by their size distribution, chemical composition, and mixing state [7–9]. Previous studies suggested that the size distribution of aerosols is a more critical factor than their chemical composition in governing CCN activity [2,10]. However, the impact of chemical composition on CCN activity signiﬁcantly increases in situations with low supersaturation [11,12]. The classical Köhler theory [1], combining the Raoult’s law effect with the Kelvin effect, illustrates that the aerosol particle activation depends on particle size, chemical composition, and SS. Pet- ters and Kreidenweis [13] developed a single hygroscopicity parameter κ in parameterizing the Raoult term, which enabled the quantiﬁcation of CCN activity without requiring infor- mation of the dissolved compounds. However, ambient aerosols are complex mixtures, and their sizes and compositions vary at different stages of atmospheric aging process [14–16], which include numerous primary and secondary organic components as well. These impose various effects on particle activation behavior and reduce the applicability of the Köhler theory in describing the actual atmospheric aerosols, especially for organic aerosols (OA). Earlier studies speciﬁcally focused on parametrizing the empirical correlations between the OA oxidation level and organic hygroscopicity parameter (κorg) [17–21], suggesting a linear correlation between κorg and the oxygen-to-carbon atomic ratio (O:C). However, the systematic variability in parametrizations between κorg and the O:C ratio determined from the different studies remains large [22]. Kuang et al. (2021) recently pointed out that secondary OA (SOA) from different precursors and formation processes may result in SOA with different chemical composition, functional properties, and microphysical structure, consequently exerting distinct inﬂuences on κorg and rendering single oxidation level parameters (such as O:C) unable to capture those differences [23].
To obtain regional parameters for aerosol particle activation, numerous ﬁeld cam- paigns have been conducted globally. Alongside the considerable spatial heterogeneity, temporal variability in aerosol activation characteristics is also essential for accurate CCN prediction [7]. The CCN activity can be characterized by two important parameters: activa- tion critical diameter (D50) and activation ratio (AR). These two parameters can be directly measured through combining cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNc) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) [24,25], and can also be determined by aerosol chemical composition and particle number size distribution (PNSD) measurements using the Köhler equation and internal mixture hypothesis [20,26–28]. The CCN activity closure analysis, based on the above two methods, is a key means of investigating the impacts of aerosol properties on activation processes. Although CCN measurements were conducted under different environments in the North China Plain, only a few studies established a linkage between CCN activity and chemical composition with a high time resolution [27,29–31]. Additionally, due to the Clean Air Action of the Chinese government initiated in 2013, stringent emission controls have been imposed to decrease ﬁne particulate matter pollution (PM2.5, particles smaller than 2.5 µm in diameter) [32]. In the Beijing region, notable reduc- tions in PM2.5 concentration over the past decade have been accompanied by signiﬁcant changes in its chemical composition [33–35]. Instead of organics and sulfate, organics and nitrate are now the dominant components of Beijing winter haze pollution. Therefore, more investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN activity in urban Beijing.

In this study, the CCN activity and aerosol chemical composition were simultaneously measured in Beijing wintertime, using a scanning mobility CCN analyzer (SMCA) and an Aerodyne aerosol chemical species monitor (ACSM). An overview of the observation data is presented in Section Overview the Observation Data. The impacts of aerosol chemical composition and mixing state on CCN activity are discussed in Section 4.1. Finally, in Section 4.2, through closure analysis of the aerosol hygroscopicity derived from CCN activity and chemical composition, we estimate κorg and parameterize it with the concentration ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC).
2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Measurement Site
Measurements of size-resolved CCN activity, aerosol size distribution and composition (organics, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, chloride, and black carbon) were conducted on the rooftop of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS) building during the period of 15 January–3 March 2022. All aerosol measurements were performed downstream of a PM10 impactor. The ambient air passes through the impactor and then enters the automatic regenerating adsorption aerosol dryer (TROPOS, Leipzig, Germany), which can dry the sample air to a low RH (RH < 30%) to ensure comparability of measurements [36]. The measurement site (116◦19(cid:48)E, 39◦57(cid:48)N, approximately 53 m above the ground) is located in a trafﬁc-intensive area of the west 3rd ring road in Beijing, China, which represents the urban environment inﬂuenced by intense anthropogenic emissions [37,38].
2.2. Instrumentation 2.2.1. Size-Resolved CCN Activity and PNSD Measurements
Size-resolved CCN spectra and activation ratios were measured using the SMCA initially proposed by Moore et al. (2010) [39]. In this work, the SMCA consisted of a CCNc- 100 (DMT Inc., Blouder, CO, USA), a differential mobility analyzer (DMA, model 3081, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA), and a condensation particle counter (CPC, model 3772, TSI Inc.). In the SMCA system, the combined DMA and CPC were used as a SMPS during the measurements. The dry particles after the diffusion dryer were neutralized by the X-ray neutralizer and were subsequently classiﬁed by the DMA in a scanning mode. Then, the particles were split into two streams: one to the CPC for measurement of total particle number concentration (NCN) and another to the CCNc-100 for measurements of the CCN number concentration (NCCN). The ﬂow rates of the CPC and CCNc-100 were 1.0 L min−1 and 0.5 L min−1, respectively. With the total sample ﬂow of 1.5 L min−1 and sheath ﬂow of 7.5 L min−1, the SMCA was protocolled to measure particles at a mobility diameter range of 8–360 nm. The DMA was operated in scanning mode with a time resolution of 180 s, including a scan time of 165 s and a retrace time of 15 s. The supersaturation in the CCNc-100 was set to be 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, respectively, with a time interval of 9 min (corresponding to three diameter scans of the DMA) for each SS during the experiment. Only the second scan for each SS is used as the CCNc needs time for SS stabilization. Therefore, a complete SS cycle lasted ~0.5 h. The CCNc-100 was regularly calibrated with ammonium sulfate particles at the four SSs (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.7%).
2.2.2. Aerosol Chemical Composition Measurement
Non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM) including sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organics with dry aerodynamic diameters below 2.5 µm was measured by an ACSM equipped with a PM2.5 aerodynamic lens at 10 min time resolution. The ACSM data were analyzed using standard data analysis software (Tofware v2.5.13). The collection efﬁciency (CE), which accounts for particle loss due to bouncing off the standard vaporizer, was derived from composition-dependent calculation following the algorithms proposed by Middlebrook et al. (2012) [40]. The calibrations of ionization efﬁciency (IE) and relative ion- ization efﬁciencies (RIEs) followed the standard procedures described in previous studies by using 300–350 nm pure ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate particles [41,42]. The

RIE values used for organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride were 1.4, 1.2, 1.1, 3.4, and 1.3, respectively.
Equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass was measured with an aethalometer (AE33, MAGEE Scientiﬁc, Berkeley, CA, USA) at 1 min. The instruments used dual-dots conﬁgura- tion to auto-correct for the loading effect. The measured absorption was converted to BC mass using an apparent mass absorption cross section (MAC) of 7.7 m2 g−1 at a wavelength of 880 nm [43]. The λ = 880 nm is chosen to avoid the potential interference of brown carbon at shorter wavelength. The multi-scattering enhancement factor (C value) of 2.88 at 880nm wavelength was used to exclude the multiple light scattering effects.
In addition, PM2.5 mass concentration data from air quality monitoring station (Wanliu) operated by the Beijing Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau were used, which is located in the northwest and northeast direction of the CAMS observation site, with a distance of approximately 3 km. The concurrent meteorological parameters (including wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and air temperature) are from the national surface meteorological observation stations of the China Meteorological Administration.
2.3. Data Processing 2.3.1. CCN Activation
The NCN and NCCN data were used to calculate the size-resolved CCN activation ratio (AR), which deﬁned as the ratio of NCCN to NCN at each particle size (NCCN/NCN vs. Dp). The inﬂuence of multiple-charge particles and DMA transfer function on AR were corrected basing on a modiﬁed algorithm developed by Hagen and Alofs (1983) [44] and Deng et al. (2011, 2013) [25,45]. Figure S1 gives a typical example of NCCN/NCN vs. Dp during the experiment, and the AR curve can be obtained by ﬁtting the NCCN/NCN ratio with the sigmoidal function:
AR = a + b/(1 + exp (
D50 − Dp σs
))
where a is the offset from 0 in the y direction and b is the height of the upper plateau of the sigmoid function, D50 is the critical diameter, and σs is a measure for the width of the sigmoid function. D50 is also called the critical diameter or the activation diameter, that is, the diameter at which 50% of the particles are activated at a speciﬁc SS. The variation in D50 at a given SS can be attributed to the variation in the number fraction of hygroscopic particles or its hygroscopicity, which can be indicated the CCN activity of a particle population. Then, the hygroscopicity parameter κCCN, derived from CCN measurements, is calculated from the critical supersaturation ratio (Sc) and D50 from the following equation [13]:
κCCN =
4A3 50(lnSc)2 ,
27D3
A =
4σs/a Mw RTρw
where σs/a is the surface tension of the solution/air interface and the solution is temporarily assumed to be pure water (0.0728 N m−1 at 298.15 K), Mw is the molecular weight of water, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1), T is absolute temperature, ρw is the density of water.
The steepness of the AR curve represents the degree of external mixture or the heterogeneity of aerosol chemical composition, which can be quantiﬁed by the ratio of (D75 − D25)/D50 [46]. D75 and D25 correspond to the diameters at which 75% and 25% of the particles are activated on the AR curve. Internal mixture implies that particles at any given dry size have equal κ with (D75 − D25)/D50 = 0. Alternatively, various κ at a given particle size indicate externally mixed aerosol compositions with higher (D75 − D25)/Dc values. Although the sigma term from sigmoid ﬁt has been used in previous studies to estimate aerosol mixing state [19,30], the (D75 − D25) value can provide a more accurate representation of aerosol mixing state. This is because the CCN measurement uncertainties would be larger due to the extremely low concentration of activated particles at the low

AR range. In addition, the relationship between activation ratio and particle size exhibits nonlinear behavior when AR < 25% or >75% (Figure S1). In contrast, within the particle size range of D25 to D75, the AR increases rapidly and exhibits a relatively linear relationship with the particle size. The sigma term represents the width of entire particle diameter range used in sigmoid ﬁt. Instead of the sigma term, using the (D75 − D25)/D50 value to describe the steepness of the AR curve can reduce the uncertainties in estimating aerosol mixing state.
2.3.2. Aerosol Hygroscopicity Derived from Aerosol Chemical Composition
The hygroscopic parameter κ is solely determined by composition and reﬂects the Raoult term in Köhler theory [13]. By assuming internal mixing, the aerosol hygroscopic- ity (κchem) can be derived from aerosol chemical composition measurements. The κchem of aerosol particles with multiple compositions is contributed by the κ of each volume- weighted composition, following the Zdanovskii–Stokes–Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule [28], expressed as:
κchem = ∑
i εiκi
where i represents the ith composition, εi is the volume fraction of each composition in the bulk, and ki is the hygroscopic parameter for each composition present in a multiple- composition particle. For the compositions determined by ACSM the AE33 measurements, a simple ion-pairing scheme [9] was used in this study, expressed as:
nNH4 NO3 nH2SO4 nNH4 HSO4 n(NH4)2SO4 nHNO3

All species are then converted to volume by assuming a density. The density (ρi) and κi values for all species used in this study are listed in Table 1 [15]. Here, a constant κ of 0.1 is used for particulate organics [47,48].

3. Results Overview the Observation Data
The time series of meteorological parameters (such as wind speed, wind direction, ambient air temperature, and relative humidity (RH)), PM2.5 mass concentration, NCN, and NCCN at SS of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% are shown in Figure 1. During the observation periods, the wind speed was mainly less than 3 m s−1, with an average of 1.3 m s−1. The relatively low wind speeds (<2 m s−1) were generally associated with southerly winds, whereas higher wind speeds (>3 m s−1) corresponded to northerly winds. When persistent southerly winds prevail (such as January 17–24th), the daily average PM2.5 concentration and RH signiﬁcantly increased from 19 to 156 µg m−3, and from 31% to 77%, respectively. The cumulative enhancement of PM2.5 concentrations was jointly inﬂuenced by local emissions, regional transport, and liquid/heterogeneous reactions at different stages of this persistent

RH signiﬁcantly increased from 19 to 156 µg m−3, and from 31% to 77%, respectively. The cumulative enhancement of PM2.5 concentrations was jointly inﬂuenced by local emis-sions, regional transport, and liquid/heterogeneous reactions at diﬀerent stages of this persistent pollution episode [49]. The RH was below 60% for most of the time, with an average of 38 ± 18%. The temperature ranged from −9 to 17 °C, with an average of 0.2 ± 4.7 °C. These meteorological parameters indicated relatively dry and cold weather conditions during this campaign. Figure 1. Time series of (a) wind speed (WS) and wind direction (WD); (b) RH and temperature; (c) CN number concentration (NCN) and PM2.5 mass concentration; (d) CCN number concentrations at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% during the campaign. The temporal variations in both aerosol number and mass concentration are shown in Figure 1c. The range of aerosol number concentration varied from ~1000 to 17,000 cm−3, with an average of 6714 ± 3117 cm−3. The PM2.5 mass concentration ranged from 2 µg m−3 to 197 µg m−3, with an average of 34 ± 39 µg m−3. During the most increasing stages of PM2.5 mass concentration, the aerosol number concentration consistently varied with the mass concentration. However, when an intermittent fog event occurred from January 23rd to 24th, the number concentration decreased with the increasing mass concentration. This suggests that the wet scavenging eﬀect of fog droplets substantially reduced aerosol num-ber concentration, but enhanced liquid-phase reactions alternatively resulting in the in-creases in mass concentration. The CCN concentration at low supersaturations (0.1%) was signiﬁcantly lower than the two relatively higher supersaturations (0.2% and 0.3%) (Fig-ure 1d), with average concentrations of 1345 ± 1270 cm−3, 2752 ± 2114 cm−3, and 3267 ± 2325 cm−3, respectively. The time series of PM2.5 chemical composition, dry particle number size distribution (PNSD), and D50 are given in Figure 2. The particle chemical composition is closely related to its hygroscopicity and activation characteristics. The hygroscopic properties of aerosols are mainly determined by composition, with inorganics having higher hygroscopicity [9,50] than less water-soluble substances, such as BC [51,52] or primary organics [53]. At a given SS, particles with higher hygroscopicity are corresponding to smaller D50, indicating such particles are more prone to activation and form cloud droplets. During the observa-tion period, organic matter and nitrate were the most important components, with aver-age percentages of 42.4% ± 11.9% and 21.5% ± 12.1%, respectively, followed by ammonium (18.4% ± 5.0%), sulfate (10.3% ± 7.3%), BC (5.0% ± 2.2%), and chloride (2.5% ± 1.8%), re-spectively. Aerosol chemical composition had a remarkable variation with PM2.5 concen-tration levels, characterized by organics dominating at low PM2.5 concentration levels (<25 µg m−3) and nitrate gradually becoming the dominant composition with increases in PM2.5

As a hygroscopic component, the increasing fraction of nitrate during pollution episodes facilitates the enhancement of aerosol hygroscopicity and activity. The time series of PNSD in Figure 2b shows that aerosol particles mainly concentrate in nucle-ation mode (Dp < 100 nm) during the clean periods. However, as the PM2.5 mass concen-tration increases, there is a signiﬁcant increase in the proportion of particle numbers in the accumulation mode, accompanied by a decrease in D50. The average D50 at SS = 0.1% (172 ± 13 nm) was signiﬁcantly larger than that at SS = 0.2% (102 ± 8 nm) and SS = 0.3% (84 ± 7 nm), indicating that the SS variation was more sensitive to D50 at a lower SS range.

Discussion 4.1. Impacts of Aerosol Physicochemical Properties on CCN Activity 4.1.1. Aerosol Chemical Properties The diurnal variations in D50 at diﬀerent SS, the mass fraction of m/z 44 in organic mass spectrum (f44), aerosol chemical composition, and PNSD are given in Figure 3. The sources and properties of aerosol particles vary with diﬀerent size ranges, leading to a diverse diurnal variation in D50 at diﬀerent SS (Figure 3a–c). As a typical tracer for SOA formation, the f44 can be associated with OA hygroscopicity owing to their positive cor-relations reported in previous studies [54,55]. Both f44 and the sum fraction of hygroscopic inorganic components (nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium) had a noticeable peak in the af-ternoon (Figure 3d,e), implying they were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by photochemical oxi-dation in the daytime. Meanwhile, the minimum of D50 for all three SS conditions occurred around 15:00, corresponding to the diurnal peak time of f44 and the fraction of inorganic components. This suggests photochemical reactions on daily basis played an important role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity.

ing pollution episodes facilitates the enhancement of aerosol hygroscopicity and activity. The time series of PNSD in Figure 2b shows that aerosol particles mainly concentrate in nucleation mode (Dp < 100 nm) during the clean periods. However, as the PM2.5 mass concentration increases, there is a signiﬁcant increase in the proportion of particle numbers in the accumulation mode, accompanied by a decrease in D50. The average D50 at SS = 0.1% (172 ± 13 nm) was signiﬁcantly larger than that at SS = 0.2% (102 ± 8 nm) and SS = 0.3% (84 ± 7 nm), indicating that the SS variation was more sensitive to D50 at a lower SS range.

4. Discussion 4.1. Impacts of Aerosol Physicochemical Properties on CCN Activity 4.1.1. Aerosol Chemical Properties
The diurnal variations in D50 at different SS, the mass fraction of m/z 44 in organic mass spectrum (f 44), aerosol chemical composition, and PNSD are given in Figure 3. The sources and properties of aerosol particles vary with different size ranges, leading to a diverse diurnal variation in D50 at different SS (Figure 3a–c). As a typical tracer for SOA formation, the f 44 can be associated with OA hygroscopicity owing to their positive correlations reported in previous studies [54,55]. Both f 44 and the sum fraction of hygroscopic inorganic components (nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium) had a noticeable peak in the afternoon (Figure 3d,e), implying they were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by photochemical oxidation in the daytime. Meanwhile, the minimum of D50 for all three SS conditions occurred around 15:00, corresponding to the diurnal peak time of f 44 and the fraction of inorganic components. This suggests photochemical reactions on daily basis played an important role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity.

Diurnal variations in (a–c) critical activation diameters (D50) at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, respectively; (d) the mass fraction of m/z 44 in organic mass spectrum (f44); (e) aerosol chemical composition; (f) PNSD. The lines and dots show the median and mean; box lower/higher bounds show the 25th and 75th and whiskers show the 10th and 90th percentiles. Note that the diurnal cycles of D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3% exhibited a remarkable max-imum around 18:00, with additional peaks occurring at 7:00 and 12:00. In contrast, no prominent diurnal peak occurred in the diurnal cycle of D50 at SS = 0.1%. Traﬃc and cook-ing emissions are the main sources of primary OA (POA) in Beijing, and these fresh emis-sions could lead to a decrease in f44 [56,57]. Therefore, the reduction time in the f44 diurnal cycle matched to the periods of daily source emissions, such as morning and evening traf-ﬁc peaks, as well as lunch and dinner times. Consequently, the hydrophobic POA was not favor for CCN activation, leading to an increase in D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. In addition, the diurnal variation in aerosol number concentration within the size range of 60–150 nm was consistent with that of D50 (SS = 0.2% and 0.3%) (Figure 3f), indicating that particles within this size range were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by traﬃc and cooking emissions. For particles larger than 150 nm, their number concentration showed no signiﬁcant changes during the periods of concentrated emissions, suggesting that local primary emissions had few inﬂuences on particle properties with this size range. Therefore, there were no signif-icant peaks observed in the diurnal variation in D50 at SS = 0.1%, which was generally larger than 150 nm during this campaign (Figure 3a). The mean value of PM2.5 mass concentration during this campaign is 25 µg m−3. Once the PM2.5 mass concentration exceeded this mean value, a period of pollution accumula-tion typically occurred for one to several days. Therefore, in order to further illustrate the impacts of aerosol chemical composition on CCN activity at the diﬀerent pollution levels, we deﬁned the PM2.5 mass concentrations ≤25 µg m−3 and >25 µg m−3 as clean and polluted conditions, respectively. Note that the bulk aerosol composition measured by the ASCM is sensitive to larger particles, which contribute the majority of the total mass. Thus, the bulk composition tends to mainly reﬂect the composition information for larger particles. Here, only the relationships between the fraction of each chemical component and D50 at SS = 0.1% are presented in Figure 4. Under the polluted conditions, the fraction of nitrate increased with PM2.5 concentrations and exhibited a negative correlation with D50 (r = −0.68), but no correlation between them (r = 0.02) under the clean conditions. In contrast, the fraction of sulfate only showed a correlation with D50 under the clean conditions (r = −0.47). These relationships indicated that as the concentration of PM2.5 increases, the dom-inant driver of CCN activity transitioned from sulfate to nitrate. Compared with the sec-ondary inorganic components, both the fractions of organics and BC showed a positive correlation with D50 due to their limited hygroscopicity.

4.1.2. Mixing State and Its Impacts on CCN Activity
As introduced in Section 2.3.1, the ratio of (D75 − D25)/D50 can be used to describe the external-mixing degree of aerosol components. The relationships between (D75 − D25)/D50 and D50 under different SS conditions are shown in Figure 5. Jurányi et al. (2013) pointed out that the (D75 − D25)/D50 varied from 0.08 to 0.12 for ammonium sulfate calibration measurements at SS = 0.1–1.0%, which indicated an internal mixture within measurement accuracy [46]. For our measurements, the value of (D75 − D25)/D50 distributed in a range of 0.14–0.59, with a median value of 0.31, 0.31, and 0.33 at SS = 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. The higher (D75 − D25)/D50 at SS = 0.3% suggested the smaller particles (Dp < 100 nm) tended to be more external mixing. The (D75 − D25)/D50 in this study is signiﬁcantly higher than that in a rural background site [31], where the (D75 − D25)/D50 ranged from 0.15 to 0.20 at SS = 0.1 to 0.7%. Compared with the rural background site, aerosol particles in urban Beijing represent a more complex mixture originating from local anthropogenic emissions and regional transport.


SS = 0.3%
Figure 5. Correlation between the ratio of (D75 − D25)/D50 and D50 at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, re-spectively. The solid circle, error bars denote the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. For a speciﬁc SS, D50 decreased with an increase in the degree of internal mixing, im-plying that enhancing the internal mixing level facilitated the CCN activity. Particularly, the variation in the mixing state exhibits high sensitivity to D50 when the ratio drops from 0.5 to 0.3. This can be attributed to the increases in the internal mixing level during the aerosol aging process, leading to an enhancement in aerosol chemical homogeneity and hygroscopicity. The relationship between (D75 − D25)/D50 and D50 can be well ﬁtted with an exponential function under the conditions of SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. However, under the condition of SS = 0.1%, their relationship is hard to be adequately ﬁtted. Further analysis of the relationship (SS = 0.1%) revealed that the relatively high values of (D75 − D25)/D50 (0.3–0.4) with small D50 (<165 nm) occurred under high PM2.5 concentration (>60 µg m−3) and high RH (>60%) conditions (Figure S2), leading to the relationship deviated from sat-isfactory ﬁtting by using an exponential function. Under these conditions, the hygrosco-picity and size of aerosol particles were enlarged due to the increasing fraction of nitrate and hygroscopic growth, respectively. Especially for the fog period, the droplets had a more diverse population of κ values, as separated by some of them already condensing droplets. However, after passing through the sampling line and being dried, these en-larged particles experienced a reduction in liquid water content and particle size. As a result, the measured dry particles represent a mixture of ambient particles (or droplets) from a wider size range with various κ values, thereby exhibiting a special kind of chem-ical inhomogeneity. 4.2. Estimating Organic Aerosol Hygroscopicity The size-resolved κccn can be derived from size-resolved CCN measurements by us-ing the D50 at various SS. Figure 6 shows the relationships between the κccn and Dp at var-ious environmental sites in China, including urban, rural, coast, and mountain sites. As can be seen, κccn exhibited a positive correlation with Dp at most of those sites except for mountain site, which had a higher κccn for the smaller particles. In these results, κccn rapidly increased with particle size at the range of ~40 to 100 nm, whereas κccn almost stays con-stant at Dp of 100 to 200 nm. This is consistent with previously reported results on the size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions [27], which presented a substantially varying composition within small particle size range and relatively stable compositions for larger particles. In addition, the κccn observed at urban sites were signiﬁcantly lower than that at rural sites, which can be attributed to the enhanced aerosol aging state from urban to rural

Ref [30] for Cai et al. 2022, ref [29] for Cai et al. 2018, ref [58] for Che et al. 2017, ref [27] for Meng et al., 2014, ref [59] for Hu et al. 2020. As the ACSM is sensitive to particle mass rather than number concentration, the bulk composition is dominated by the contribution of the larger particles. Therefore, a better correlation between κchem and κccn was exhibited at SS of 0.1% compared with the other two SS conditions (Figures 7a and S3), suggesting the κccn measured at SS = 0.1% was more suitable for closure analysis with κchem derived from bulk composition. Here, we assume the discrepancy between κchem and κccn was mainly induced by the utilization of constant OA hygroscopicity parameter (κorg). Then, the κorg can be derived by subtracting the con-tribution of the inorganic salts (κinorg) from the κccn at SS = 0.1%, expressed as: 𝜅(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)=𝜅(cid:2913)(cid:2913)(cid:2924)−(𝜅(cid:2919)(cid:2924)(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)𝜀(cid:2919)(cid:2924)(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)+𝜅(cid:2886)(cid:2887)𝜀(cid:2886)(cid:2887))𝜀(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)

Duplissy et al. (2011) pointed out that the uncertainty in the estimation of κorg de- creases with increasing organic fraction; thereby, only data featuring organic fractions larger than 50% were used in this calculation [17].
As is shown in Figure 7b, the κorg shows a positive relationship with the concentration ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC), which can be used to reﬂect the contribution of SOA to total OA [60,61]. Several previous studies suggested κorg as a function of the f 44 or O:C [54,55]; however, κorg was not correlated to the f 44 during the observation periods of this study. This is similar to a recent study conducted by Kuang et al. (2021), which pointed out that κorg was weakly correlated with O:C, but well correlated with the sum mass fraction of aged biomass burning OA and more oxygenated OA in total OA [23]. In order to parame- terize the relationship between κorg and Org/BC ratios, κorg values were binned by Org/BC in increments of 5. Then, a power ﬁtting function κorg = 0.05×(Org/BC)0.42 was obtained. This ﬁtting function was adopted to reconstruct the hygroscopicity parameter (κchem_new). As is shown in Figure 7a, a better correlation between κchem and κccn was achieved after using the parameterized κorg instead of constant value (0.1), indicating suitable κorg scheme play an important role in deriving κchem from aerosol chemical composition.
5. Conclusions
The in situ measurements of CCN activity at ground level can be applied to opti- mize the parameters of retrieving cloud microphysics with remote sensing data. Notable reductions in PM2.5 concentration over the past decade have been accompanied by sig- niﬁcant changes in its chemical composition in the North China Plain. Therefore, more investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN activity. In this study, aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and CCN number concentration were measured concurrently to investigate the size-resolved CCN activity during wintertime 2022 in Beijing, China. The critical activation dimeter D50 derived from size-resolved activation ratio can be negatively associated with CCN activity. During the observation period, the average CCN concentrations at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were 1340 cm−3, 2750 cm−3, and 3270 cm−3, corresponding to the average D50 of 172 nm, 102 nm, and 84 nm, respectively. The impacts of aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and mixing state on CCN activity were investigated. The results show that photochemical oxidation on a daily basis played an important role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity. Conversely, the local emissions (such as trafﬁc and cooking) signiﬁcantly enhanced D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had few inﬂuences on D50 at SS = 0.1% due to the limitations of particle size from emission sources. As PM2.5 concentration increases, the dominant driver of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. For carbonaceous components, both the fractions of organics and BC showed a positive correlation with D50 due to their weak hygroscopicity. The mixing state of particles was also estimated based on the size-resolved AR curve ﬁtting. At a speciﬁc SS, D50 decreased with increasing the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal-mixing degree resulting from atmospheric aging facilitated to the enhancement of CCN activity.
Aerosol hygroscopicity parameter κccn derived from the SMCA method was size- dependent, varying from 0.26 to 0.34 as Dp increased from 84 to 172 nm. Based on the bulk aerosol chemical composition measured by the ACSM, the κchem values were calculated using the ZSR method. The OA hygroscopicity κorg was estimated by the closure analysis between κchem and κccn. However, the commonly used f 44 (or O:C) was weakly correlated with κorg and failed to describe the variations in κorg during the observation periods of this study. Instead, the variations in κorg can be well parameterized using the Org/BC ratio, which is usually used as a tracer for the contribution of SOA to total OA. The parameterization of κorg substantially improved the correlation between κchem and κccn, emphasizing the importance of considering κorg variations when deriving κchem from aerosol chemical composition.
