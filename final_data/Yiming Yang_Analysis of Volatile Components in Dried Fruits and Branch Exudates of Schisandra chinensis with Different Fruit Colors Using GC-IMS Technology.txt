Abstract: To investigate the volatile components of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Bail (commonly known as northern Schisandra) of different colors and to explore their similarities and differences, to identify the main ﬂavor substances in the volatile components of the branch exudates of northern schisandra, and ﬁnally to establish a ﬁngerprint map of the volatile components of the dried fruits and branch exudates of northern Schisandra of different colors, we used GC-IMS technology to analyze the volatile components of the dried fruits and branch exudates of three different colors of northern Schisandra and established a ﬁngerprint spectra. The results showed that a total of 60 different volatile chemical components were identiﬁed in the branch exudates and dried fruits of Schisandra. The components of germplasm resources with different fruit colors were signiﬁcantly different. The ion mobility spectrum and OPLS-DA results showed that white and yellow fruits were more similar compared to red fruits. The volatile components in dried fruits were signiﬁcantly higher than those in branch exudates. After VIP (variable importance in projection) screening, 41 key volatile substances in dried fruits and 30 key volatile substances in branch exudates were obtained. After screening by odor activity value (OAV), there were 24 volatile components greater than 1 in both dried fruits and branch exudates. The most important contributing volatile substance was 3-methyl-butanal, and the most important contributing volatile substance in white fruit was (E)-2-hexenal.

Schisandra chinensis (Tuncz.) Baill. is a perennial woody vine of the Schisandra family mainly produced in eastern Russia, northeastern China, Korea, and other places. Its fruit is a traditional Chinese medicinal material, commonly known as “Northern Schisandra”. Schisandra contains a variety of medicinal active ingredients, mainly including lignans, polysaccharides, volatile oils, triterpenes, organic acids, etc. [1]. The 2020 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia records 100 prescriptions related to Schisandra, which are usually used to treat various diseases, such as asthma and cardiovascular diseases [2,3]. The volatile oil of Schisandra can also improve cognitive dysfunction in mice [4]. The volatile chemical constituents of Schisandra, a signiﬁcant part of which is Schisandra essential oil, have been extensively studied for their pharmacological activity. Experimental validation has shown that Schisandra essential oil has anti-inﬂammatory and neuroprotective effects [5]. The volatile components of Schisandra can signiﬁcantly alleviate neuronal damage and apopto- sis, protecting the hippocampal and cortical structures [6]. These volatile components also

alleviate skeletal muscle cell damage in mice [7] and have shown potential resistance to atherosclerosis [8]. Schisandra not only has a pleasant aroma but also has high potential pharmacological activity, making it of great research value in both culinary and medicinal applications. The dried fruits of Schisandra chinensis contain about 20% volatile oil, which mainly consists of terpene compounds [9].
Gas chromatography–ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) is a sensitive and rapid gas phase separation detection technology that has emerged in recent years. It combines ion mobility spectrometry with gas chromatography to generate a two-dimensional spectrum of volatile compounds. This is based on the retention characteristics of the gas chromatogra- phy column and the ion mobility rate of the ion mobility spectrometry detector, providing a more convenient, faster, and accurate method of analysis [10]. Furthermore, the sample does not require complex concentration and enrichment, which helps maintain the stability of ﬂavor substances. As such, GC-IMS can be widely used for distinguishing volatile compo- nents and isomers, analyzing trace components, and facilitating rapid on-site detection [11]. It is commonly used for odor detection in various ﬁelds, such as food and environmental pollution, and is very suitable for the rapid detection of volatile components [12]. GC-IMS technology can be applied to the identiﬁcation of volatile organic compounds in traditional Chinese medicine materials, and the measurement results can be used as a reference for quality evaluation and variety selection. The University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ap- plied GC-IMS technology to measure the effect of different drying methods on the volatile oil components of wolfberry [13]; Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine used GC-IMS technology to study the ﬁngerprint of Asarum volatile oil and its chemical pattern recognition [14]; Zhejiang Institute of Food and Drug Inspection established a ﬁngerprint of volatile substances in Aurantium using GC-IMS technology and established a new method for identifying Aurantium [15]. Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine applied GC-IMS technology to measure the volatile oil components of Schisandra, and the results showed that the composition of Schisandra volatile components was complex, including terpenes, aromatics, aliphatics, and other compounds [6].
According to the “Flora of China”, Schisandra is a small red berry that is nearly spherical or obovate in shape, with a diameter of 6–8 mm. Most Schisandra berries are red or dark red, and people often use the depth of the red color as a sensory indicator to evaluate the quality of Schisandra. As a result, the color of Schisandra berries has been subjected to directional selection pressure during natural evolution. White and yellow germplasms, as freely segregating offspring, are very precious germplasm resources. The Schisandra National Forest Germplasm Bank of the Institute of Special Products of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has collected white and yellow Schisandra germplasm resources and used SRAP technology to analyze the genetic rules of fruit color. The results show that the genotype of red Schisandra is dominant homozygous, white is recessive homozygous, and yellow fruit is heterozygous [16]. However, there have been no reports on the differences in volatile components between different fruit colors. In this study, we measured the volatile components of dried fruits and branch exudates of three different fruit colors of Schisandra and established a ﬁngerprint map of volatile components of different fruit colors of Schisandra. Using principal component analysis, cluster analysis, OAV value analysis, OPLS-DA analysis and other methods, we screened the key aroma components of Schisandra and qualitatively analyzed the key volatile components of different fruit colors of Schisandra fruits. This lays a foundation for germplasm identiﬁcation, quality evaluation, variety selection, and development of volatile compounds in dried fruits and branch exudates.

Ion Migration Spectra Analysis of White, Yellow, and Red Schisandra chinensis Dried Fruits The ion migration spectra of dried fruits of diﬀerent colors are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that there are more points separated in the dried fruit spectra than in the branch sap spectra. By judging the peak positions, it can be preliminarily seen that the components of W4 and W5 are more similar and signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of W6. The diﬀerential spectrum shows that there are more blue dots in W6, indicating that the relative content of some volatile chemical substances in W4 and W5 is higher than that in W6.

2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Analysis of Ion Migration Spectra of Schisandra chinensis Branch Sap and Dried Fruits of Diﬀerent Colors Using GC-IMS technology to analyze the volatile components of branch sap and dried fruits of three diﬀerent colors, the two-dimensional ion migration spectra of volatile organic compounds obtained are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The horizontal axis represents the ion migration time, and the vertical axis represents the gas chromatographic retention time. The red vertical line at 1.0 on the horizontal axis is the RIP (reaction ion peak), and the dots shown in the picture are the volatile organic compounds detected in the sample. From white to red, the deeper the color, the higher the relative concentration of volatile organic compounds. 2.1.1. Ion Migration Spectra Analysis of White, Yellow, and Red Fruit Branch Sap Figure 1 shows that the peak positions of W1 and W2 in the three ion migration spectra are close, and the composition of W3 is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that of W1 and W2. Taking W1 as a reference and subtracting the signal peaks of W1 in the remaining spectra, a diﬀerential spectrum can be obtained. In the diﬀerential spectrum, blue dots indicate that the corresponding volatile organic compounds in this sample are reduced compared to those at the same position in W1. Red dots indicate that this substance contains more than W1, and the deeper the color, the greater the diﬀerence. In the diﬀerential spectrum, it can be found that compared with W1, except for some positions where the content of W2 is reduced, there are fewer volatile organic compound diﬀerence points. The content diﬀerence of volatile organic compounds in W3 is more signiﬁcant, and there are more diﬀerence substances compared with W1 and W2.

Figure 1 shows that the peak positions of W1 and W2 in the three ion migration spectra are close, and the composition of W3 is signiﬁcantly different from that of W1 and W2. Taking W1 as a reference and subtracting the signal peaks of W1 in the remaining spectra, a differential spectrum can be obtained.

it can be found that compared with W1, except for some positions where the content of W2 is reduced, there are fewer volatile organic compound difference points. The content difference of volatile organic compounds in W3 is more signiﬁcant, and there are more difference substances compared with W1 and W2.
2.1.2. Ion Migration Spectra Analysis of White, Yellow, and Red Schisandra chinensis Dried Fruits
The ion migration spectra of dried fruits of different colors are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that there are more points separated in the dried fruit spectra than in the branch sap spectra. By judging the peak positions, it can be preliminarily seen that the components of W4 and W5 are more similar and signiﬁcantly different from those of W6.

Finger-print spectra can also be used as a reference for the evaluation and identiﬁcation of Schi-sandra chinensis germplasm resources in the future. Consistent with the results of the mi-gration nursery, the number and types of volatile substances in Schisandra chinensis dried fruits are signiﬁcantly higher than those in Schisandra chinensis branch sap, indicating that the aroma of Schisandra chinensis dried fruits is richer than that of branch sap. W1 and W2 have high similarity, W4 and W5 have high similarity, and the ﬁngerprint spectra of white and yellow fruits are more similar. Figure 3. Fingerprint spectra of white, yellow, and red Schisandra chinensis branch sap. Figure 4. Fingerprint spectra of white, yellow, and red Schisandra chinensis dried fruits. 2.3. Classiﬁcation of Volatile Chemical Substances in Branch Sap and Dried Fruits The volatile compounds in dried fruits and branch exudates can be classiﬁed into alkenes, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, and others (as shown in Figure 5). Overall, the amount of volatile substances detected in dried fruits is higher than that in branch exudates. Among them, alkenes, alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes are present in high amounts in dried fruits. The volatile components in branch exudates are mainly alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes. Alkenes are the high-content volatile substances in dried fruits. The total amount of volatile substances in white and yellow fruits is relatively high, both in dried fruits and branch exudates. The content of alkenes is the highest in W4 and W5. In the corresponding W1 and W2, the content of ketones is the highest, followed by

2.4. Principal Component Analysis and OPLS-DA Analysis of Samples
The peak volume data of monomers and dimers of the same chemical substance detected were merged and the experimental data obtained from six injections were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA-X), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and 200 times permutation test using SIMCA 14.0 software. The branch exudates and Schisandra dried fruits were divided into two groups, and the VIP values of each component were calculated. SPSS 27 software was used to perform one-way ANOVA analysis and homogeneity of variance test on the chemical components of branch exudates and Schisandra dried fruits, respectively, to obtain p values. Volatile components with special contributions were screened using p value < 0.05 and VIP value > 1 as the criteria for further data analysis.
A total of 60 different volatile chemical components were identiﬁed in Schisandra branch exudates and dried fruits using GC-IMS. With 60 common components as depen- dent variables and dried fruits, branch exudates and different fruit colors as independent variables divided into six groups, PCA-X and OPLS-DA analysis of samples of Schisandra dried fruits and branch exudates of different colors can achieve effective differentiation.
The volatile chemical components obtained were processed using PCA, resulting in the data shown in Figure 6. The R2X (1) = 0.648 and the R2X (2) = 0.13, indicating that the model samples have good reliability. It can be observed that there is a good distinction between the dried fruits and branch exudates, and the differences between different groups are also noticeable. The data obtained from PCA was further processed and analyzed. In the OPLS-DA analysis (Figures 7 and 8), the independent variable ﬁtting index R2X = 0.972, the dependent variable ﬁtting index R2Y = 0.992, and the model prediction index Q2 = 0.965 are all greater than 0.5, and the ﬁtting result is acceptable [17]. Then, 200 permutation analyses were performed on all experimental data to verify whether the model is effective (Figure 9). As shown in the ﬁgure above, the intersection of the Q2 regression line with the vertical axis is less than 0, indicating that the model is effective, that there is no overﬁtting, and that the analysis is effective.
The results show that there are signiﬁcant differences in the main component compo- sition of Schisandra of different colors. The biplot shows that the dried fruit samples are more closely related to more volatile components, indicating that the ﬂavor of Schisandra dried fruits is richer and the main ﬂavor components of branch exudates are signiﬁcantly different from those of dried fruits.


way ANOVA analysis and homogeneity of variance test on the chemical components of branch exudates and Schisandra dried fruits, respectively, to obtain p values. Volatile com-ponents with special contributions were screened using p value < 0.05 and VIP value > 1 as the criteria for further data analysis. A total of 60 diﬀerent volatile chemical components were identiﬁed in Schisandra branch exudates and dried fruits using GC-IMS. With 60 common components as depend-ent variables and dried fruits, branch exudates and diﬀerent fruit colors as independent variables divided into six groups, PCA-X and OPLS-DA analysis of samples of Schisandra dried fruits and branch exudates of diﬀerent colors can achieve eﬀective diﬀerentiation. The volatile chemical components obtained were processed using PCA, resulting in the data shown in Figure 6. The R2X (1) = 0.648 and the R2X (2) = 0.13, indicating that the model samples have good reliability. It can be observed that there is a good distinction between the dried fruits and branch exudates, and the diﬀerences between diﬀerent groups are also noticeable. The data obtained from PCA was further processed and ana-lyzed. In the OPLS-DA analysis (Figures 7 and 8), the independent variable ﬁtting index R2X = 0.972, the dependent variable ﬁtting index R2Y = 0.992, and the model prediction index Q2 = 0.965 are all greater than 0.5, and the ﬁtting result is acceptable [17]. Then, 200 permutation analyses were performed on all experimental data to verify whether the model is eﬀective (Figure 9). As shown in the ﬁgure above, the intersection of the Q2 re-gression line with the vertical axis is less than 0, indicating that the model is eﬀective, that there is no overﬁtting, and that the analysis is eﬀective.

The screening results show that there are 30 key volatile substances in branch exu- dates and 41 key volatile substances in dried fruits in terms of content. The VIP values show that the chemical substances with the greatest contribution in the branch exudate group are: 2-ethylhexanol (1.234), ethanol (1.219), acetone (1.193), 2-hexanone (1.189), and 1-propanol (1.186); in the dried fruit group, the key substances with the greatest contribution are: (E)-2-heptenal (1.159), 5-methylfurfural (1.158), cyclohexanone (1.154), (E)-2-hexenal (1.153), and 2-acetylfuran (1.153). The results indicate that the aroma com- position of Schisandra dried fruits and branch exudates is complex, with many chemical

substances contributing signiﬁcantly, and there is a signiﬁcant difference between the volatile substances of branch exudates and dried fruits.
In order to further visually display the contribution of different aroma component contents to different samples, ORIGIN was used to perform differential analysis on the aroma of Schisandra branch exudates and dried fruits. According to the criteria of p < 0.05 and VIP > 1, ﬂavor substances were screened and classiﬁed [18]. The peak area was normalized, and cluster heat maps were made separately. The red part in the ﬁgure can directly show the classiﬁcation according to the different component contents and can also see the highest and most prominent volatile substances (Figures 10 and 11).

2.5. Analysis of OAV Values of Schisandra chinensis Branch Exudates and Dried Fruit and Screening of Key Flavor Substances
VIP values can only indicate the contribution of volatile components, and do not fully represent the composition of odors. The true olfactory composition of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit cannot be determined solely by VIP values. The introduc- tion of odor activity values (OAV) is necessary to determine the aroma characteristics of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit. Calculating OAV values can more intuitively show the contribution of a single component to the overall aroma. It is generally believed that: OAV > 1 can be considered to have a certain impact on the aroma of the sample, and OAV > 10 proves that the aroma component has a great impact on the aroma of the sample. Calculate the OAV values and standard deviations of each aroma component in the branch exudates and Schisandra chinensis dried fruit, and screen according to the standard of OAV > 1, and then perform correlation analysis.
The internal standard method is used to quantify the chemical substances detected in six groups of samples. The internal standard is 4-methyl-2-pentanol with a concentration of 198 ppb and a signal peak volume of 504.95. Therefore, the intensity of each signal peak is about 0.392 ppb. The detected chemical substances are analyzed and calculated to ﬁnally obtain the concentration and standard deviation of three repeated injections of each chemical substance. Schisandra chinensis dried fruit selects the air threshold, and Schisandra chinensis branch exudates selects the water threshold. A total of 57 components can query the threshold value and calculate according to the method described above.
After screening, W1 has 15 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 8 aroma components greater than 10; W2 has 15 aroma components with OAV val- ues greater than 1 and 8 aroma components greater than 10; W3 has 14 aroma compo- nents with OAV values greater than 1 and 8 aroma components greater than 10; W4 has 24 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 12 aroma components greater than 10; W5 has a total of 22 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 14 aroma components greater than 10; W6 has a total of 22 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 10 aroma components greater than 10. Except for the white dried fruit, the main contributing aroma is (E)-2-hexenal, and the main contributing aroma of the remaining samples is all 3-methyl-butanal (Table 3).

Through the screening of OAV values, the key ﬂavor substance in white fruit dried fruit is (E)-2-hexenal. This substance is also the main aroma-contributing substance of Chinese jujubes, with a strong plant aroma (fresh green, multi-leaf, rich fruit ﬂavor) ﬂa- vor characteristics [4] (http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/search2.html, accessed on 28 March 2023). Both Schisandra chinensis dried fruit and branch exudates show that 3-Methyl-butanal is the key ﬂavor substance of Schisandra chinensis. This substance is the main aroma component of green tea that has been killed and has elegant peach, choco- late, and fat aromas [19]. It can be used as a characteristic volatile label substance for Schisandra chinensis identiﬁcation. 1,8-cineole in dried fruit is also a major contributing aroma substance with a cool mint and camphor smell. It is the main aroma component of Australian grape wine and is also used as a food additive and spice [20]. At the same time, chemical substances such as β-ocimene and myrcene with high OAV values have also been found in traditional Chinese medicines such as qianhu and have obvious aromatic odors (Surendran et al. 2021; Jovanovi´c et al. 2015 [21]). There are a total of 24 volatile chemical substances with OAV > 1 in Schisandra chinensis dried fruit and branch exudates. The aroma substances are rich and have high potential for tea, seasoning, and spice development.
3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Experimental Materials
Six-year-old Schisandra trees were used as materials. White fruit germplasm (3N2S2), yellow fruit germplasm (variety “Jinwuwei No. 1”) and red fruit germplasm (variety “Yanzhihong”) were all collected from the Schisandra National Forest Germplasm Resource Bank of the Institute of Special Products of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Figure 12). Three clonal plants were selected for each resource. The three different-colored Schisandra fruits were harvested when they were fully ripe in September 2019. After removing the stems and branches in the laboratory, they were dried in the shade at 22 ◦C. They were completely dried after one month and then vacuum-sealed and stored in a refrigerator at 4 ◦C, respectively. In March of the following spring, branch exudates from the above germplasms were collected, placed in 50 mL centrifuge tubes, and labeled as white juice, yellow juice, and red juice. Three parallel samples were set up for each sample. W1, W2, and W3 are branch exudates of white-fruit, yellow-fruit, and red-fruit Schisandra, respectively. W4, W5, and W6 are dried fruits of white-fruit, yellow-fruit, and red-fruit Schisandra, respectively.

Preliminary analysis: Use the VOCal analysis software that comes with the FlavourSpec® ﬂavor analyzer. The VOCal software can be used to analyze the spectra output from the instrument and perform qualitative and quantitative data analysis. The built-in IMS and NIST databases can be used to compare and qualitatively identify volatile substances. After establishing a standard curve for the identiﬁed substances, quantitative analysis can be per- formed. The database is equipped with three plug-ins: Reporter, Gallery Plot, and Dynamic PCA. The Reporter plug-in can directly compare spectral differences in two-dimensional, three-dimensional and other aspects; the Gallery Plot plug-in can compare the output ﬁngerprint spectra and quantitatively and intuitively compare the differences in volatile substances between different samples; the Dynamic PCA plug-in can perform dynamic prin- cipal component analysis and similarity analysis to quickly identify unknown samples [22].
Quantitative calculation of chemical components:
Ci =
Cis × Ai Ais
Ci is the calculated mass concentration of the chemical component, in µg/L; Cis is the mass concentration of the internal standard substance. The internal standard substance used in the experiment is 4-methyl-2-pentanol, with a concentration of 198 µg/L; Ai is the signal peak volume of the chemical component; Ais is the signal peak volume of the internal standard substance.
3.2.4. OAV Value Analysis
The OAV analysis method will be used to analyze and screen the main aroma compo- nents. The calculation of the OAV value is related to the threshold value of the main aroma component itself. The selection of the threshold value mainly refers to the book “ODOUR THRESHOLDS”. Due to different years and different statistical methods, there may be differences in the same substance. The principle for selecting the threshold value in this experiment is: the air threshold value is selected for Schisandra dried fruit, and the water threshold value is selected for Schisandra branch exudate. All threshold values are selected from the latest data (odor thresholds: compilations of odor threshold values in air, water and other media).
Calculation of OAV value:
OAV =
C OT
C—the amount of substance, in units of mg/m3 (in air), mg/kg (in water); OT—the threshold value of the substance itself.

3.2.5. OPLS-DA Analysis
OPLS-DA analysis, also known as orthogonal partial least squares discriminant anal- ysis, is used to observe the clustering of samples based on principal component analysis (PCA) data analysis. The OPLS-DA analysis model is then used to screen VIP values, identify differential variables, and locate key differential volatile substances. This part was used by SIMCA and SPSS.
4. Conclusions
This study applied GC-IMS technology for the ﬁrst time to analyze volatile chemical substances in Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit of different colors. The volatile substance ﬁngerprint of white-, yellow-, and red-fruit Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit was established. This ﬁngerprint can effectively distinguish Schisandra chinensis dried fruit and branch exudates of different colors and can be directly used for quality characteristic evaluation and germplasm identiﬁcation.
Different algorithms, such as PCA-X, one-way ANOVA, OPLS-DA, and OAV were used to compare and analyze the volatile components of Schisandra chinensis. The results showed significant differences in content among the aroma components of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit. The content and number of high-content types of aroma components in Schisandra chinensis dried fruit are higher than those in branch exudate sam- ples. Comparing between different fruit colors, it was found that the aroma composition of white fruit and yellow fruit Schisandra chinensis is closer, with red fruit Schisandra chinensis signiﬁcantly different from yellow fruit and white fruit.
The experiment screened out key volatile chemical substances of dried fruits and branch exudates through VIP value and p value joint screening. The key volatile substances of overripe fruits are more abundant than those of branch exudates, with complex composi- tion and signiﬁcant differences. These ﬁndings highlight the importance of considering both plant part and maturity stage in analyzing volatile components, providing valuable insights for future research in plant chemistry.
