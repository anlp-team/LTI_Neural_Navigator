1 Welcome Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, Master of
Computational Data Science Program. While this handbook is specific to
your academic experience in the department, there are several other
resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during
their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word,
the student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs, the
Office of the Dean of Students, and others are included in Appendix A of
this handbook.
1.1 The MCDS Degree The MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS)
degree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language
Technologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer
Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students
with a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with
advanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to
students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics,
programming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in
Computer Science is not required. Most students will complete the
program in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and
students focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for
further graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an
additional fourth semester.
The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations;
students entering the program enroll in core courses in their first
semester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration
(see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in
consultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad
guidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given
concentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program
is typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a
required Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical
training. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the
LTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in
6


corporate research and development laboratories.
The program consists entirely of coursework and a Capstone Project, and
no Master’s Thesis is required. All Capstone projects are structured as
research activities and may lead to a publication. There is no Doctoral
program in Computational Data Science. Because of the highly selective
nature of the MCDS program and quality of the MCDS curriculum,
performing well in the program will give a boost to a PhD application. MS
graduates are welcome to apply to CMU PhD programs but will not receive
preferential treatment.
There are significant differences between CMU's different departments
and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies and
regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate
students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that
students have written access to the standard information outlined below.
This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for
the Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) degree.
All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of
Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies described in The
Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook and at the
University Policies website.
1.2 Vision Carnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society
through continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and
entrepreneurship.
1.3 Mission To create a transformative educational experience for students focused on
deep disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; leadership,
communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-
being.
To cultivate a transformative university community committed to (a)
attracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; (b) creating a
collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where
7


research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and
(c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential.
To impact society in a transformative way — regionally, nationally, and
globally — by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the
university campus.

http://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/index.html
Please see Appendix A for additional information about university resources.
1.6 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state or local laws or executive orders.
Inquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be directed to the university ombudsman, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, telephone 412-268-1018. Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling 412-268-2000.
Carnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report. describing the university's security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault and fire safety policies, and containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on the campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412-268-2323. The annual security and fire safety report also is available online at www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports.
Information regarding the application of Title IX, including to admission and employment decisions, the sexual misconduct grievance procedures and process, including how to file a report or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment, and how the university responds to such reports is available at www.cmu.edu/title-ix. The Title IX
9


coordinator may be reached at 412-268-7125 or tix@cmu.edu.
1.7 The Carnegie Mellon Code
Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct possible.
These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.
The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.
The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.
The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at: https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/.

The School of Computer Science provides several black-and-white and color printers for use by students. SCS Computing Facilities maintains a list of printers: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/.
2.3 Office Space for MS Students Full-time students in the LTI’s MS degree programs on the Pittsburgh campus have access to a shared working space to create a sense of community and provide space for working when on campus.
2.4 Computers for MS Students Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access university resources and complete course assignments. Laptops running Windows, MacOS, and Linux software are all acceptable.
MS students will be given a CS user id. A CS user id is required to use the LTI computer cluster, department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science has a Help Center located at 4203 GHC. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu, extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line.
MS students will be given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.
3 MCDS Degree Completion and Certification This section describes the various rules and regulations that determine the attainment of a MCDS degree by the student.
3.1 CMU Degree Completion and Statute of Limitations Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary significantly – ranging from two semesters for some full-time master’s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.
Early Completion
Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-
11


granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances.
Extended or Longer-than-Standard Completion
Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances. Master’s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements.
Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html
See the above link regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time allowable for master’s degree completion and certification.
Additional Guidance for Students
Program of study. Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.
Financial aid and student account Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than- standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master’s degree programs.
International students Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.
12


3.2 Full-time Status All MCDS students are expected to enroll full-time (at present, there is no option to pursue the degree as a part-time student). To be considered a full-time student, a student must be registered for, and complete, a minimum of 36 units in every Fall and Spring semester. All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status. Students can have no more than one (1) remote course counting toward the 36 units used to satisfy full-time enrollment. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, “permit of stay”). All students having a Stafford Loan are required to maintain full-time status.
3.3 MCDS Degree Enrollment Process and Related Information
3.3.1 Duration of the degree program
The MCDS degree must be completed within five (5) years from the time that the student matriculates into the program.
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html
As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations (see link above), students will complete all requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program.
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master’s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.
3.3.2 Residency requirements
There is no formal residence requirement. However, most courses in the program are taught on campus without an option for distance education. Students enrolled in in- person course sections (IPR) are expected to attend all class meetings in person.
3.3.3 Degree Certification: Course requirements and related policies/protocols
13



In order to receive the MCDS degree, students must have a Quality Point Average (QPA) of 3.0. Completion of the degree is based on completing courses in the core curriculum, the MCDS seminar, electives and capstone project.
The capstone project consists of students working at CMU on a research project, or on an industry-sponsored project.
The student must complete 144 eligible units of study. This includes eight core and concentration courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and two 12-unit capstone courses. All students complete a common MCDS core in their first two semesters, consisting of five courses. All students must also complete at least one concentration, consisting of three courses in one of three areas: Analytics, Systems, or Human-Centered Data Science. The remaining elective course can be any course with number 600 or above chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.
To maintain full-time enrollment status, a student must enroll in a minimum of 36 course units per semester. A student may not take more than 60 units per semester, without permission from their academic advisor. Students must maintain full-time enrollment status (minimum of 36 units) in their final semester.
3.3.4 Prerequisite Core Course
All MCDS students are expected to pass the 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science course by the end of their first semester. Each student must pass 11-637 with a grade of “B” or better.
3.3.5 Plan of study
The degree consists of two timing options based on the length of time the student spends working on the degree. The student chooses their timing at the start of the degree program (for visa requirements). Changes in timing are possible with the approval of the Director of the degree program and successful visa extension application with CMU’s Office of International Education. Note that all degree options consist of the same amount of coursework:
Professional Preparation Track – a 16-month degree consisting of study for Fall and Spring semesters, a summer internship, and Fall semester of study. Each semester consists of a minimum of 48 units of study. This timing is typical for most students. The student graduates in December.
Research Preparation Track – a 20-month degree consisting of study for Fall and Spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of Fall and Spring study. Each semester consists of a minimum of 36 units of study. This timing is designed for students interested in extending their time at CMU for developing applied research skills in preparation for further graduate study or research- oriented employment. Note that the per-semester course load is lower, but the total cost is higher since four semesters of tuition are paid. This timing is also 14


recommended for students interested in pursuing a PhD after graduation. The student graduates in May.
3.3.6.1 MCDS Curriculum
All MCDS students must complete 144 units of graduate study which satisfy the following curriculum:
11-637 - Foundations of Computational Data Science  Four (4) additional MCDS Core Courses (10-601 Introduction to Machine Learning; 05-839 Interactive Data Science; 15-619 Cloud Computing; 11-631 Data Science Seminar; 48 units)
Three courses (3) from one area of concentration curriculum (36 units)  Three (3) MCDS Capstone courses (11-634, 11-635 and 11-632) (36 units)  One (1) Elective: any graduate level course 600 and above in the School of Computer Science (12 units)
3.3.6.2 Common MCDS Core Courses
All MCDS students are required to complete four common core courses in their first two semesters:
10-601 - Machine Learning  15-619 - Cloud Computing  05-839 - Interactive Data Science  11-631 - Data Science Seminar
3.3.6.3 Areas of Concentration
In addition to the common MCDS core, all students must complete at least one area of concentration, which consists of three courses in Analytics, Systems, or Human- Centered Data Science. Students consult with their academic advisor and choose one or more areas of concentration during their first semester, in preparation for enrolling in Spring classes.
Analytics concentration:
o One (1) Machine Learning course o One (1) Software Systems course o One (1) big data course
Systems concentration:
o 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (elective, prerequisite for many
advanced Systems courses)
o Three (3) systems project courses  Human-Centered Data Science concentration:
o One (1) Methods course o Two (2) HCI courses
15


A detailed list of courses satisfying each concentration is contained in the MCDS Program FAQ.
3.3.6.4 MCDS Capstone Courses
All MCDS students complete three Capstone courses:  11-634 - Capstone Planning Seminar (12 units)  11-635 - Capstone Research (12 units)  11-632 - Data Science Capstone (12 units)
MCDS Program Learning Outcomes
Design, implement and evaluate the use of analytic algorithms on sample datasets.
Explain how a machine-learning model is developed for and evaluated on real world datasets.
Design and execute experimental data collection and present resulting analyses using appropriate user experience (UX) techniques including interactive data visualizations.
Apply and customize analytics, systems and human-centered data science techniques to application-specific data science requirements and objectives. Identify tradeoffs among data science techniques (analytics, systems and/or human-centered) and contrast design alternatives, within the context of specific data science application domains.

Survey, interpret and comparatively criticize state of the art research talks and papers, with emphasis on constructive improvements.
Organize, execute, report on, and present a real world data science project in collaboration with other researchers/programmers.
Depending on the concentration, additional learning outcomes are emphasized:
Analytics. Students electing to complete the Analytics concentration will also learn to:
Design, implement and evaluate a software system and machine-learning model on real world datasets at real world scale.
Analyze and document data science requirements in different application domains and survey as well as critique state of the art solutions for those requirements.
Systems. Students electing to complete the Systems concentration will also learn to:
16



Implement and evaluate complex, scalable data science systems, with emphasis on providing experimental evidence for design decisions.
Anticipate and avert structural and/or implementation problems with systems design, especially with scaling and tail distributions.
HCDS. Students electing to complete the Human-Centered Data Science (HCDS) concentration will also learn to:
Design, implement and evaluate a user experience prototype to allow for clear understanding of data science solutions.
Apply social and behavioral research methods to data science problems to understand the human aspects of data collection and analysis.
Throughout their coursework, students will take introductory courses on all those topics, practice them in advanced courses and seminars and demonstrate all learned skills in their Capstone project and internship. Students are encouraged to choose elective courses in the curriculum according to their professional goals and mastery of the main subjects.
3.3.10 Capstone project
The capstone project consists of students working in a team or individually on a project. The capstone project integrates the educational experience of the student. A capstone project is typically a CMU research project, or an industry sponsored project; occasionally students define capstone topics through communication with the faculty. Students interested in defining their own capstone topics should discuss with the MCDS faculty as early as possible. The capstone project is a great opportunity for a student (or student team) to “show off” their unique skills and accomplishments. Capstone projects have been instrumental in the hiring decisions for several employers.
3.3.11 Elective courses
Electives can be any graduate level course (numbered 600 or above) in the School of Computer Science. Students use their elective courses to enhance study in an area of interest or to explore new areas of interest.
3.3.12 Undergraduate courses
Undergraduate courses are taken to address an area of weakness in the student’s prior preparation. Undergraduate courses (numbered less than or equal to 599) may be taken pass/fail or for credit but do not count toward the 144 units of eligible study: The course and course grade will appear on the student’s transcript, and the course grade will factor as part of the student’s QPA.
17


3.3.13 Independent study course
Independent study courses allow students to cover study of a particular area of interest, and are used when no formal course is available in a given subject area. Students who are interested in continuing to a Ph.D. degree often enroll in Independent Study, since it offers the opportunity to perform research directly with a faculty member. Independent study courses are considered electives.
Each independent study course must be advised and approved by at least one faculty member. Agreement to supervise an independent study course is purely voluntary on the part of the faculty member. It is the duty of the student, therefore, to negotiate the terms and conditions of the independent study with the pertinent faculty members of CMU who will be supervising the study. These individuals are referred to as “independent study supervisors.” Once the student finds someone who agrees to supervise such a course, he/she must:
1. Students wishing to take an independent study must request approval from their academic advisor and complete proposal before the first day of classes in a given semester:
2. Enter into an agreement with the independent study supervisor that includes course expectations, including deliverables.
3. Secure the “Independent Study Contract Form” from the MCDS administrator. 4. Complete the form, provide a brief description of the work to be done, including deliverables and how they will be graded.
5. Secure signatures of both the student and the supervisor. Return the form to the MCDS administrator in order to obtain approval for the independent study from the Director.
Independent study contracts must be submitted no later than on the last day of the first week of classes in a given semester.
3.3.14 Double counting courses
No course may be used to complete two MCDS degree requirements, nor may a course satisfy requirements in two degree programs.
3.3.15 Courses outside of the School of Computer Science
Elective courses in other Schools at Carnegie Mellon may be taken with prior permission of the Director.
3.3.16 Grades
All courses offered by the SCS CMU are graded on the 4.3 grading standard http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html. MCDS students must maintain a 3.0 overall average each semester to remain in good standing. A student must obtain a B- or better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student
18


receives a C- or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree requirements. All courses must receive a letter grade; courses taken pass/fail do not count towards the MCDS degree.
Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student- records/verifications/
3.3.17 Student Review, Academic Probation and Academic Actions
The MCDS program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each semester in order to monitor individual student progress towards graduation regarding the fulfillment of curricular requirements, course grades, and academic integrity. Should a student’s effort fall below the acceptable level of academic performance and/or fail to meet standards and policies established by Carnegie Mellon University, the student may be dismissed from the program.
Infractions
After each academic progress review, each student will receive a letter indicating the result of the review and their standing in the program. If applicable, the letter will also note the following infractions by the student in the given semester:
Cumulative QPA is below 3.0, resulting in the student being put on Academic Probation (see below)
Cumulative QPA is below 2.6, resulting in academic probation or possible dismissal (see below)
Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee (see 3.7.2)
Minimum QPA and Academic Probation
Students must maintain a cumulative QPA of 3.0 to remain in good standing with the program. Should a student’s overall QPA drop below 3.0 during any given semester, he/she will be placed on academic probation for the following semester. In probation cases, the student will be required to
enroll in courses as advised by the academic advisor, 
improve his/her grades to no less than an overall 3.0 QPA in the following semester, and
meet any other goal set by the advisor during that period (e.g., fulfilling a core course requirement).
If a student’s cumulative QPA drops below 2.6, the student will be considered at risk of being unable to complete the program and will be considered for dismissal. He/she will be required to meet the program director to discuss his/her situation. Only if, after that meeting, the MCDS program committee ascertains that the student is likely to complete
19


the remaining program requirements in the allotted time, the student will be allowed to continue his/her studies in MCDS, and dismissed otherwise. If the student is allowed to continue their studies, they will be placed on academic probation for the following semester and is subject to the requirements above.
Dismissal
A student may be dismissed from the program for any of the following cases:





If the student has been put on academic probation and failed to meet the remedial requirements set by the advisor in the following semester, or committed an Academic Integrity Violation deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee while on academic probation If the student has a cumulative QPA of 2.6 or lower and the MCDS program committee does not ascertain that the student is likely to complete the remaining program requirements in the allotted time If the student has committed two Academic Integrity Violation deemed infractions by the MCDS committee (see 3.7.2) If the student has committed an Academic Integrity Violation infraction where the violation is deemed to be sufficiently egregious as determined by the MCDS program committee If the student has been found to infringe a University Policy, where such infringement is deemed grounds for dismissal
Students who realize that one of these situations may apply to them are strongly encouraged to meet with the academic advisor to discuss a plan to mitigate the situation. Students who find they are struggling in the program will have the best chances of success if they communicate early and often with the academic advisor.
3.3.18 Incomplete grades
Carnegie Mellon University students are expected to complete a course during the academic semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a grade of “I” (incomplete) may be given when a student has been unable to complete the work of a course. However, the work completed up to that date must be of passing quality and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students.
By awarding an “I” grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for the completion of the work and designate a default letter grade in the event that the student fails to complete the remaining work.
Students must complete the required course work by no later than the end of the following academic semester or sooner if required by the instructor.
20


The instructor must record the permanent course grade by the last day of the examination period of the following semester, or the Registrar will automatically assign the default grade.
If further work has not been completed after one semester and a default grade is rendered, the default grade will become the grade of record.
3.3.19 Change of grades and missing grades
If a grade has been assigned in error, it can be changed to a different permanent grade. The procedure for changing a grade is as follows:  Discuss the matter with the course instructor; provide evidence that the grade issued


was not the grade earned. If the instructor agrees, the student should contact the program administrator to process a Change of Grade Form in order to correct the grade that was issued in error. Generally, the instructor is the final authority for a course grade. If a grade has not been assigned, please notify the course instructor for the completion of a Missing Grade Form.
3.3.20 Qualifying examinations and procedures (or equivalent)
None required.
3.3.21 Thesis/dissertation
None required.
3.3.22 On transfer to another program
If the requirements for the MCDS degree have not been completed when a student leaves to pursue another academic program, the degree will not be awarded. Completion of the MCDS degree does not guarantee admission into any doctoral degree program at Carnegie Mellon University. The courses that will be completed as part of the MCDS may serve to enhance one’s application to these programs but will in no way insure admittance.
3.3.23 Intellectual property policy
The MCDS degree program adheres to Carnegie Mellon University policy on intellectual property: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html
3.3.24 Teaching requirements
None required. However, students are encouraged to apply for teaching assistant positions in courses where they have excelled.
3.3.25 Language proficiency requirements
None required. However, non-native English speakers are encouraged to take advantage of the various support functions provided by the Intercultural Communication Center (ICC) and the Global Communication Center (GCC).
21


3.3.26 Academic Integrity and Policies on Plagiarism and Cheating
The university considers any form of cheating or plagiarism to be a serious violation of student ethics. The student is required to understand and rigorously follow only the permitted forms of collaboration as defined by the instructor in every class. The work you submit must be your own, unless you have clearly attributed it to others. You must not use the work of others without proper citation. And, you must not use resources, including other persons, except as authorized by the course or project for which you are submitting the work. Such conduct might be accepted or commonplace elsewhere, but it is not here. Be careful. Be warned. Failure to abide by these rules, even just once, can result in your permanent separation from the University without refund of money paid. Note that the policy requires the student to be informed and understand the academic integrity rules for every assignment or exam in a course.
The MCDS program strives to produce graduates with the highest standards of academic integrity. Academic Integrity Violations are taken very seriously and the MCDS program has a zero tolerance policy for multiple Academic Integrity Violations. A single violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program if deemed sufficiently egregious as determined by the MCDS program committee. If a student commits a second violation, the expected penalty is dismissal from the graduate program (see also academic progress review at section 3.3.17).
Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.
3.3.27 Process for Appealing Final Grades
https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and-academic-actions.html
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy.
22


3.3.27 Teaching Assistants
The MCDS degree does not have a teaching requirement. However, some students may wish to be a teaching assistant. MCDS students may petition for approval to TA up to one course per semester provided that they are in good academic standing (Overall QPA 3.0 or above).
As required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990, graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns.
The full university policy can be reviewed at:
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency- instructors.html.
In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (mandatory screening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/
3.3.28 Internship Requirement and Search for Full Time Employment
An internship is required for the degree program. In some cases, when a student has prior work experience, the Director of the degree program may waive this requirement. Students start searching for internships generally in the Fall and Spring semesters. Once the student returns from an internship in the Fall, they should immediately begin the search resources are available at http://www.cmu.edu/career/ including a resume submission system, a list of employers, on campus interviews and mock interviews, and many other resources.

3.5 University Policies on Grades and Grading
3.6.1 University Policy on Grades
This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.
You can review the university grading policies here: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html
3.6.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses
Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university’s cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college’s and department’s policies allow this.)
You can review the university policy here: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html
3.6 Academic Integrity
3.7.1 Expectations Regarding Proper Conduct
In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports
24


discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.
Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.
In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.
Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html). The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html) is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.
3.7.2 Protocol for Academic Integrity Violations
The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures and the appeal process for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged academic integrity violation.
For more information on disciplinary actions please see:
https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/acad_standards/creative/disciplinary.html
Further documentation on how to respond to an allegation of a violation as a graduate student:
25


https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/academic-integrity/grads.html
Important Note: MCDS implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program”. We have adopted the following hearing procedure and “two strikes” rule:

If an instructor determines that an academic integrity violation has occurred, both the instructor and students are given the opportunity to explain the situation to the MCDS program committee. A written hearing by email suffices for this purpose.
The program committee then reviews all information and decides whether the violation is deemed an infraction (see 3.3.17), and which secondary actions are to be taken on the program level.
Two-Strike-Rule: MCDS may dismiss students upon a first AIV infraction. A second infraction will always lead to the offending student being dismissed from the program, with no exceptions.
The MCDS program reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, the degree will be withdrawn promptly upon discovery of the falsification.

4 Academic Policies
4.1 MCDS Academic Policies
4.1.1 Duration of Study
MCDS students enrolled for full-time studies are normally expected to complete the degree in three semesters (16 months). This includes a summer internship.
4.1.2 Double-Dipping
A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval.
4.1.3 Pass/Fail and Audit Grades
Pass/fail and audit grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail or audit option for these courses.
26


4.1.4 Transfer Credit
An equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another institution, may be permitted to satisfy one of the MCDS course requirements, with permission from the Director. Students must petition for transfer credit by providing the Program Director with the prior course syllabus and other details that may be required by the Director in order to make a decision. See the section on “Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption”. NOTE: In all cases, credit may only be transferred from another degree program for courses deemed “free electives” - i.e., courses which were not used to satisfy a core requirement or total units requirement in a prior degree program.
All MS students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU.
4.1.5 External Internships and Job Interviewing
MCDS students are expected to attain an external internship during the summer. International students must coordinate carefully with the University, due to visa restrictions. International students are required to consult with the Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract.
We caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) implications with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their academic advisor before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your own inventions if they occur during an external internship.
While it is necessary for students to travel off-campus for job interviews, it is not acceptable for a student to miss a course requirement or a capstone project commitment due to interview travel. Students should work proactively with prospective employers to arrange interview travel in a way that minimizes the impact on their final semester course work.
4.1.6 Transferring into the MCDS Program
Direct transfers into the MCDS program are not permitted. Students who are currently enrolled at Carnegie Mellon who wish to transfer into the MCDS program must do so by applying to the MCDS program via the normal admissions process. As specified in Sec. 4.1.4 in this document, some transfer credit and/or exemption from MCDS requirements may be possible on a case-by-case basis.
4.1.7 Transferring Out of the MCDS Program
The MCDS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MCDS degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired
27


degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to request such a transfer.
4.1.8 Statute of Limitations
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html
As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations (link above), students will complete all requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program.
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master’s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.
4.2 LTI Academic Policies
4.2.1 “Grandfather” policy
A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. In unusual cases, the Director may approve exceptions to the program requirements.
4.2.2 Course Drop/Add/withdrawal procedures
Students taking undergraduate and Master’s level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes/index.html.
There is a separate calendar for masters level courses.
4.2.3 Courses with restricted enrollment
MCDS students have priority for the program core courses. The MCDS program administrators cannot intercede with other departments to secure seats for its students in other courses as all departments reserve seats for their accepted students. Usually all Students can, remaining open seats are assigned on a first- come, first-served basis.
28


on occasion, contact the assigned course instructor in order to plead his/her case for admission to the course. Admission may be granted at the discretion of the instructor. The policy of the department offering the course(s) is always followed.
4.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption
The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the Director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.
4.2.5 External Employment/Consulting
Since the MCDS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment and/or consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss this with their advisor. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment.
4.2.6 Leave of Absence
A student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the program administrator to apply for a return to the program.
4.2.7 Withdrawal from Program
Students may voluntarily withdraw from the MCDS program. If a student decides to withdraw, or is considering a withdrawal, she/he should contact the program administrator to schedule an advising meeting as soon as possible.
The university’s general withdrawal policy can be found here:
https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/leaves-and-withdrawals/
4.2.8 Satisfactory Progress
If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on “End of Semester Evaluation”. In particular, students in the three-semester program who fail one of their first-semester MCDS core required courses are strongly encouraged to consider switching to the four-semester program.
4.2.9 Winter and Summer Breaks
29


Students supported by research projects or working in an on-campus internship are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is typically allowed in the summer for the students who are working on campus (not pursuing an external internship). Supported students should arrange their winter break time with their supervisor.
4.3 CMU Academic Policies
4.3.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities http://www.cmu.edu/education-office/disability-resources/ The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability Resources' secure online portal (https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/) or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process.
Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268-6121.
4.3.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program.
You can review a summary of the university’s graduate student’s appeal and grievance procedures here: https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html
4.3.3 Safeguarding Educational Equity: Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault
30


The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith. The University’s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual- misconduct/index.html.
The University’s Policy Against Retaliation is available at: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html
If you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources:

4.3.4 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate Students
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html
This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.
4.3.5 Gestational and Parental Accommodations https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation- protocol.html
Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of the semester may consider taking time away from their coursework and/or research responsibilities. Any student who gives birth to a child while engaged in coursework or research is eligible to take either a short-term absence or formal leave of absence. Students are encouraged to consult with relevant university faculty and staff as soon as possible as they begin making plans regarding time away.
Students must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations. Students will complete an information form and meet with a member of the Dean’s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student. 31


o Planning for the student’s discussion with appropriate academic contact(s)
(advisor, associate dean, etc.) may be reviewed during this meeting.
Students in course work should consider options for the semester of the anticipated birth such as working with their course instructors to receive incomplete grades, electing to drop to part-time status or taking a full semester leave of absence.
Students engaged in research must work with their faculty to develop plans for the research for the time they are away and for resuming upon return.
Master's students who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) weeks during a Short-Term Maternity Accommodation or a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six weeks is medically necessary. To receive this support students must be registered with the Office of the Dean of Students.
4.3.6 Change of Address MCDS students are responsible for notifying MCDS and the HUB of all address changes in a timely manner. Students will be held responsible for any failure to receive official college notices due to not having a correct address on file; F-1 students may jeopardize their status if address information is not kept current. Students can change their address using SIO, which is available via the HUB website: http://www.cmu.edu/hub/index.html
5 Financial Issues
5.1 Tuition
5.1.1 Tuition payments
To understand your invoice, payment options, etc., visit: http://www.cmu.edu/hub. The MCDS program sets tuition each year for all students in the program. The student must handle tuition problems by contacting The Hub. The MCDS Program Administrators cannot solve tuition problems.
5.1.2 Sponsored Students
A sponsored student is one who has another party (such as an embassy or company) who has agreed to pay the student’s tuition. Please read the “Sponsored Students” section.
5.1.3 Employer Reimbursement Process
If you have an employer reimbursement plan, write your employer’s name and address on the bill (or provide CMU with a letter of support) and pay at least one-third of the
32


tuition charge when returning the bill. You must pay previous semester balances before you can enroll for the next semester.
5.1.4 Carnegie Mellon employee reimbursement procedure
Contact the Benefits Office for specific information on tuition benefits. You must complete a Tuition Remission Form each semester in order to receive these benefits. To the Human Resources website at: receive a Tuition Remission Form, visit http://www.cmu.edu/hr.
5.1.5 Financial aid, tuition waivers, Scholarships
