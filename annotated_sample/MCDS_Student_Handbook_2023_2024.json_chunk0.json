............................................................................................................ 10\n5\n\n\n1 Welcome Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, Master of\nComputational Data Science Program. While this handbook is specific to\nyour academic experience in the department, there are several other\nresources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during\ntheir tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word,\nthe student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs, the\nOffice of the Dean of Students, and others are included in Appendix A of\nthis handbook.\n1.1 The MCDS Degree The MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS)\ndegree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language\nTechnologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer\nScience at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students\nwith a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with\nadvanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to\nstudents with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics,\nprogramming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in\nComputer Science is not required. Most students will complete the\nprogram in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and\nstudents focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for\nfurther graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an\nadditional fourth semester.\nThe MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations;\nstudents entering the program enroll in core courses in their first\nsemester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration\n(see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in\nconsultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad\nguidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given\nconcentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program\nis typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a\nrequired Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical\ntraining. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the\nLTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in\n6\n\n\ncorporate research and development laboratories.\nThe program consists entirely of coursework and a Capstone Project, and\nno Master\u2019s Thesis is required. All Capstone projects are structured as\nresearch activities and may lead to a publication. There is no Doctoral\nprogram in Computational Data Science. Because of the highly selective\nnature of the MCDS program and quality of the MCDS curriculum,\nperforming well in the program will give a boost to a PhD application. MS\ngraduates are welcome to apply to CMU PhD programs but will not receive\npreferential treatment.\nThere are significant differences between CMU's different departments\nand degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies and\nregulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate\nstudents of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that\nstudents have written access to the standard information outlined below.\nThis handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for\nthe Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) degree.\nAll policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of\nComputer Science (SCS) policies and university policies described in The\nWord, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook and at the\nUniversity Policies website.\n1.2 Vision Carnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society\nthrough continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and\nentrepreneurship.\n1.3 Mission To create a transformative educational experience for students focused on\ndeep disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; leadership,\ncommunication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-\nbeing.\nTo cultivate a transformative university community committed to (a)\nattracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; (b) creating a\ncollaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where\n7\n\n\nresearch, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and\n(c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential.\nTo impact society in a transformative way \u2014 regionally, nationally, and\nglobally \u2014 by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the\nuniversity campus.\n1.4 MCDS Contact Information The people responsible for administering the MCDS degree are:\nJennifer M Lucas Academic Program Manager Master of Computational Data Science Language Technologies Institute School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Gates-Hillman Center 6415 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 Phone: (412) 268-9870 Fax: (412) 268-7287\nCarolyn Penstein Ros\u00e9, Director Master of Computational Data Science Language Technologies Institute School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Gates-Hillman Center 5419 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 Phone: (412) 268-4525 Fax: (412) 268-7287\nRobert Frederking Graduate Program Chair Language Technologies Institute School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Gates-Hillman Center 6515 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 Phone: (412) 268-6656\nMona Diab, LTI Director Language Technologies Institute School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Gates-Hillman Center 5723 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 Phone: (412) 268-3669\nThe Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5 th and 6th floors of the Gates Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Pittsburgh campus:\nLanguage Technologies Institute Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue Gates Hillman Complex 5402, LTI Pittsburgh, PA 15241-3891\n412-268-6591 (phone) 412-268-6298 (fax) http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/\n8\n\n\n1.5 University Policies and Expectations Each member of the Carnegie Mellon community must be familiar with university policies and guidelines. In addition to this departmental graduate student handbook, the following resources are available to assist you in understanding community expectations:\nThe Word/Student Handbook: Academic Integrity Website: University Policies Website: Office of Graduate and Post-Doc Affairs:\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/index.html https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- life/academic-integrity.html http://www.cmu.edu/policies/\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/index.html\nPlease see Appendix A for additional information about university resources.\n1.6 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state or local laws or executive orders.\nInquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be directed to the university ombudsman, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, telephone 412-268-1018. Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling 412-268-2000.\nCarnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report. describing the university's security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault and fire safety policies, and containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on the campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412-268-2323. The annual security and fire safety report also is available online at www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports.\nInformation regarding the application of Title IX, including to admission and employment decisions, the sexual misconduct grievance procedures and process, including how to file a report or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment, and how the university responds to such reports is available at www.cmu.edu/title-ix. The Title IX\n9\n\n\ncoordinator may be reached at 412-268-7125 or tix@cmu.edu.\n1.7 The Carnegie Mellon Code\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct possible.\nThese standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.\nAs members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.\nThe discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.\nThe commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.\nThe Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at: https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/.\n2 The Language Technologies Institute\n2.1 Main Office The Gates Hillman Complex: Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental resources are in GHC 5404.\n10\n\n\n2.2 Photocopies and Printers The use of a printer/copier requires a CS user id (see the \u2018Computers\u2019 section). The School of Computer Science provides several black-and-white and color printers for use by students. SCS Computing Facilities maintains a list of printers: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/.\n2.3 Office Space for MS Students Full-time students in the LTI\u2019s MS degree programs on the Pittsburgh campus have access to a shared working space to create a sense of community and provide space for working when on campus.\n2.4 Computers for MS Students Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access university resources and complete course assignments. Laptops running Windows, MacOS, and Linux software are all acceptable.\nMS students will be given a CS user id. A CS user id is required to use the LTI computer cluster, department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science has a Help Center located at 4203 GHC. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu, extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line.\nMS students will be given access to the LTI\u2019s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.\n3 MCDS Degree Completion and Certification This section describes the various rules and regulations that determine the attainment of a MCDS degree by the student.\n3.1 CMU Degree Completion and Statute of Limitations Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary significantly \u2013 ranging from two semesters for some full-time master\u2019s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.\nEarly Completion\nGraduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-\n11\n\n\ngranting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances.\nExtended or Longer-than-Standard Completion\nLonger-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances. Master\u2019s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program and will be certified at the end"
