(Audit form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html)\n20\n\n\n4.1.6 Adding a Course\nDuring the ADD period of each semester (the first two weeks of the semester), students may add a course by registering online. After the ADD deadline, they may add a course by completing the Late Add Request form and obtaining the permission of both: 1) the instructor or teaching department and 2) their advisor. (Add form can be found at www.cmu.edu/hub/forms)\n4.1.7 Dropping a Course\nDropping courses is not recommended except for reasons of health or family emergency. Many SCS courses have long waitlists, and dropping a course means that some other student who might have had the opportunity to take the course had been denied that ability. Also, if students in the MSAII program drop courses, then the instructors of those courses may no longer allow MSAIIs to enroll.\nSometimes, however, a student\u2019s workload can become unexpectedly heavy because of course requirements. No one is expected to suffer from such pressure and dropping a course may become a necessity. To avoid this unfortunate circumstance, you should inform yourself in advance of the curriculum and workload in each course you plan to take and ensure that you are capable of handling the load. Note that CMU SCS courses are very difficult, and students who may easily have handled taking five courses simultaneously at another institution may not be able to do so at CMU.\nExact add, drop and withdrawal dates may be found on the official Academic Calendar. Up until the deadlines, students can initiate course adds and drops through Student Information Online (SIO). Courses dropped by the deadline will not appear on the student's record, and courses withdrawn from by the deadline will receive a 'W' grade. Additionally, a voucher process has been implemented for late drops.\nStudents taking undergraduate and Master\u2019s level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course- changes/index.html.\nLate Course Drops & Vouchers\nA late drop voucher system was implemented beginning with the fall 2018 semester to permit a limited number of late course drops. Master's students are permitted one drop voucher per year of study and may use only one voucher per semester (including summer). Courses dropped using a voucher will be removed from the student's record, as long as the drop is confirmed in SIO by the student within 24 hours of receiving the automated voucher email (refer to instructions below). Students may use drop vouchers up until the last day of classes each\n21\n\n\nsemester. These policies are spelled out at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course- changes/index.html.\nNote that the Core courses and some Knowledge courses are only offered once per year so dropping a course may delay program completion.\nNote: International students must maintain a minimum of 36 units (Full time) to meet the U.S. government\u2019s visa requirement. Please check with the Office of International Education (OIE) for more information.\n4.1.8 Transfer Credits\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html\nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this.).\nThe MSAII program does not accept transfer credits.\n4.1.9 Leave of Absence\nStudents who need to delay their studies for personal, medical or academic reasons may do so with a leave of absence (leaving the university temporarily with a commitment to return). Students must contact the MSAII Director to discuss their plans and fill out the appropriate form. The student\u2019s place in the program will be held until a mutually determined time. For more information refer to www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html. When planning to return from Leave of Absence students must complete the appropriate paperwork before returning to the University.\n4.1.10 Withdrawal\nStudents who need to withdraw from the program (leave the university with no intention of returning) for personal, medical or academic reasons must contact the MSAII Director to\n22\n\n\ndiscuss their plans and fill out the appropriate form. For more information refer to www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html.\n4.2 Tuition and Fees\nInformation about tuition and fees is available at www.cmu.edu/hub/tuition/index. MSAII students will pay tuition according to the rates set for the School of Computer Science. All tuition and fees must be paid in full by the due date; a student not in good financial standing will be dismissed from the program. Students taking summer courses must pay tuition.\n4.3 Graduation Ceremonies\nThe University holds one Commencement ceremony in May of each year. Only students who have completed their degree requirements may participate in Commencement.\nThere are no August or December commencement ceremonies.\n4.4 LTI Academic Policies\n4.4.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy\nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period.\n4.4.2 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption\nThe LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the program director, on the advice of the faculty member for whose course an exemption is sought. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the exempted course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.\n23\n\n\n4.4.3 Employment/Consulting\nSince consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the Program Director's consent. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any paid position. Students may use their consulting time to perform unpaid work on research projects for CMU faculty.\n4.4.4 Leave of Absence\nThe LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA) since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most one year, upon written request to the MSAII Director and with the consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.\nStudents taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university\u2019s leave of absence process, which is described at www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- life/student-leave.html.\n4.4.5 Satisfactory Progress\nIf a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on \u201cEnd of Semester Evaluation.\u201d\n4.5 Carnegie Mellon Academic Policies\n4.5.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities\nThe Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the Carnegie Mellon community. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations must submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form to access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process.\nFor more information, please see www.cmu.edu/hr/eos/disability. Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268-6121.\n24\n\n\n4.5.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures\nStudents who believe that they have been inappropriately treated are encouraged to raise their concern(s) with the Program Director, department head, or other designated person in their department, college, or central administration according to University policies. No effort will be made to prevent or discourage anyone from availing themselves of such procedures (see Graduate Student Appeal and Procedures www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance- procedures.html).\nGraduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource web page. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program. Additionally, students may confer with the Graduate Education Office (graded@andrew.cmu.edu) on issues of process or other concerns as they navigate conflicts.\n4.5.3 Process for Appealing Final Grades\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html.\nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy\n4.5.4 Safeguarding Educational Equity:\nPolicy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith. The University\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-\n25\n\n\ngovernance/sexual-harassment-and-sexual-assault.html. If you believe you have been the victim of sexual harassment or sexual assault, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources:\nOffice of Title IX Initiatives, http://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/, 412-268-7125\nSexual Harassment Advisors, found in Appendix A of the Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault;\nSurvivor Support Network, found in Appendix B of the Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault;\nSexual Harassment Process and Title IX Coordinators, found in section II of the Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault;\nUniversity Police, 412-268-2323\nUniversity Health Services, 412-268-2157\nCounseling & Psychological Services, 412-268-2922\nAdditional resources and information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources- and-information/resources.html.\nThe MSAII program has a ZERO TOLERANCE policy on sexual harassment and sexual assault. If you are found to have violated Carnegie Mellon policy, you will be dropped from the MSAII program immediately without exception. CMU has spent decades successfully developing a non-threatening environment for all genders and no one will be permitted to interfere with that accomplishment.\nConsensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate Students\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html\nThis policy is relevant for graduate students who will be in a supervisory role of undergraduate students as a TA or in a research lab/studio setting. This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.\n4.5.5 Cultural Tolerance\nThe MSAII program is extremely diverse for a program of its size. We have students from numerous different countries who must work effectively in a team setting. The students\n26\n\n\ninvariably come from very different cultures that have differing attitudes towards age, gender, and group interaction. The program management understands this, but the students must also recognize that this program is being conducted in the United States and operates according to U.S. norms. Students and faculty, regardless of background, age, or rank, must deal with each other respectfully without insult or raised voices. It is impossible to conduct teamwork in any other way. Violations will be dealt with harshly. The Program Director is not sympathetic to such behavior, which will not be tolerated. Repeated infractions, or a serious single infraction may result in termination from the program.\n4.5.6 Language Policy\nThe MSAII program is a component of the Language Technologies Institute, which studies and celebrates the diversity of human language and forms of expression. The LTI also recognizes the futility and unfairness of attempting to determine the language students must use when communicating. However, it is unprofessional in any official team meeting to speak a language that is not understood by all team members. For example, if all members of a team understand Chinese, then they may use Chinese in team meetings. However, if even one team member does not understand Chinese, then a language must be used that is understood by all team members. It is recommended that non-native speakers of English use English as much as possible if they intend to seek employment in an English-speaking country.\n4.5.7 Maternity Accommodation Protocol\nStudents whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of the semester may consider taking time away from their coursework and research responsibilities. All female students who give birth to a child while engaged in coursework or research are eligible to take either a short- term absence or formal leave of absence. Students in course work should consider either working with their course instructor to receive incomplete grades or elect to drop to part-time status or to take a semester leave of absence. Students engaged in research must work with their faculty to develop plans for the research for the time they are away.\nStudents are encouraged to consult with relevant university faculty and staff as soon as possible as they begin making plans regarding time away. Students must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations. Students will complete an information form and meet with a member of Dean\u2019s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student. Planning for the student\u2019s discussion with her academic contact(s) (advisor, associate dean, etc.) will be reviewed during this meeting.\n4.6 Statute of Limitations\nwww.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html.\n27\n\n\nStudents must complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program.\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.\nAny request for a waiver of the statute of limitations must be approved by the Department Head and by the SCS Associate Dean for Masters Programs. The waiver request must explain the exceptional circumstances that warrant an extension. For cases in which a waiver is granted, the waiver will cover specific courses and will specify a time period for completion of the program.\nSee also the \u2018Duration of Study\u2019 policy.\n5 Financial Issues\n5.1 Graduate Student Funding\nThe LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional MS programs. Students are encouraged to seek financial aid and support from other sources. The HUB website (www.cmu.edu/finaid/graduate/index.html) provides the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links. Additional information on financial issues for graduate students can be found on the web at www.cmu.edu/hub/new-grad/.\nStudents in the professional MS programs are not prohibited from seeking support as Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants. However, typically full-time MS students do not have time for these activities. Typically Research Assistantships are most likely to be awarded to students in Carnegie Mellon\u2019s research-oriented degree programs.\n28\n\n\n5.2 University Financial Aid\nGraduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website: www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html. Students will find the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links.\n5.3 Health Insurance\nCarnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree-seeking students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered by the University or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is \u201cenrolled as the dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance plan\u201d (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/).\nIt is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester, or elect a payment plan over the course of the academic year. More information is available at the Student Health Services Web site www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/.\n5.4 Emergency Loans\nwww.cmu.edu/student-affairs\nAll students regardless of their program are eligible for the Emergency Student Loan, which is an interest-free and emergency-based loan repayable within 30 days. It is available through the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs; students may apply for the loan by stopping in to the Student Affairs Office, Warner Hall 301, or by calling (412) 268-2075 for an appointment.\n6 Additional University Resources\n6.1 The HUB Student Services Center\nthehub@andrew.cmu.edu and www.cmu.edu/hub/\nThe HUB is located in Warner Hall, Lower Level. The HUB staff delivers comprehensive service and counsel to students and families regarding financial aid, billing and payment, registration and academic records. The Assistant Directors in The HUB serve as contacts for specific colleges and assist enrolled students with key aspects of the enrollment process. A student can find their\n29\n\n\nassigned HUB Assistant Director on their Student Information Online (SIO) Resource page. Questions that need specialized, in-depth attention can be directed to the student's assigned Assistant Director. For general questions and information, students may email The HUB or call 412-268-8186.\n6.2 Student Information Online (SIO)\nStudent Information Online (SIO) is a secure site where students can find important, personalized information, including E-Bills and student account information, financial aid status and eligibility, grades and QPA, and course schedules. Students can update their and their spouse\u2019s or domestic partner's contact information, sign up for E-Check & E-Refund, authorize their spouses, domestic partners or another individual to receive a copy of their E-Bill, request verifications, view their housing and meal plan assignments, and much more. Students can log on to SIO by going to www.cmu.edu/hub/sio and entering their Andrew User ID and password.\nOn SIO, students will designate an emergency contact address of a relative or family friend to be contacted in the case of an emergency. If students do not want their name and address published in the campus directory, they must notify the HUB in writing.\n6.3 ID Cards\nGraduate students can obtain their ID card from The HUB once they have been entered into SIO for the semester. These cards identify their holders as members of the campus community. Student cards are deactivated upon the cardholder\u2019s separation from the university.\nAffiliate ID Cards are available for spouses and partners of graduate students that allow them to access Carnegie Mellon\u2019s campus. These cards are available through The HUB to spouses and partners of graduate students who are enrolled for the current academic year in a full-time graduate degree program. The card is valid for one year. For information about domestic partner registration, visit the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs webpage: www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/domestic-partner/.\nFor more information about student and affiliate ID cards (spouse, domestic partners and dependent children), please visit https://www.cmu.edu/oie/settling-in-guide/information-for- families.html.\n6.4 Transcripts\nInformation about and instructions for ordering transcripts are available at: www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/transcripts/. Transcript questions may be directed to esg-transcripts@andrew.cmu.edu.\n30\n\n\n6.5 Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration\nwww.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/registration/cross/index.html\nCross-registration provides an opportunity for enriched educational programs by permitting full-time graduate students to cross-register for courses (usually no more than one per semester) at a Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) Institution. Full-time Carnegie Mellon degree students are eligible and the PCHE course may not count towards full-time status unless the student is enrolled in an inter-university program. Students interested in taking advantage of this opportunity should be familiar with the Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses already outlined previously in this handbook.\nDepartment specific information about graduate students\u2019 ability to cross register and transfer grades should be included here.\n6.6 Student Privacy Rights and FERPA\nwww.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/privacy-rights-students.html\nThis university policy notifies students of their rights under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). According to FERPA, students have the right to:\n\ninspect and review their education records;\n\nrequest an amendment to their education record if they believe they are inaccurate or misleading;\n\nrequest a hearing if their request for an amendment is not res"}
