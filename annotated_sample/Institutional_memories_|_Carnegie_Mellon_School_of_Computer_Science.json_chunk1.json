We didn\u2019t have an undergraduate program, so the concerns that the other departments had about staffing courses, advising, admissions and so forth were not our concerns. Other departments were worried they weren\u2019t getting enough graduate students\u2014we were beating graduate students off with sticks. We were a misfit in MCS.\n\nFeeling that CSD\u2019s needs were inadequately represented in MCS, Habermann and Jordan in 1986 wrote a white paper proposing the creation of \u201ca School of Computer Science.\u201d MCS administrators and others across campus protested loudly.\n\nMORRIS : University politics is a sibling rivalry on steroids. If you see another department about to become a college, you get angry. Creating a school of computer science wasn\u2019t an intellectual vision shared by physicists, the faculty senate and the fine arts people.\n\nJORDAN : Allen Newell really deserves a lot of the credit. Simon preferred to remain on the sidelines. He couldn\u2019t care less whether computer science was a department or a school\u2014he was already connected to the rest of the school, so why should he fight?\n\nSIEWIOREK : Allen was a very careful, logical-thinking, great statesman, almost like a Benjamin Franklin. He dropped his research to make the spin-out happen of a School of Computer Science.\n\nMORRIS : Ninety percent of the maneuvering was Allen Newell\u2019s doing. Nico was in charge of running the place, but if Allen said we should do something, we did it, and that included Nico.\n\nSIEWIOREK : When Allen talked, people listened. No matter how discouraged you got, when you talked to Allen, you were energized. He was a reluctant administrator. Taking the point position to get us separated was something I\u2019m assuming he felt he had to do, but it would not have been something he aspired to do.\n\nNEWELL (1991): I\u2019ve never been interested in institutional growth \u2026 these were obligations. They were always completely secondary to the science \u2026 If you go after institutions, you don\u2019t get any science done.\n\nMORRIS : The guy who actually made it happen was Angel Jordan, who was the provost at the time. He put it across over the objections of many people.\n\nJORDAN : I was fairly unpopular at the time. At one point, there was a petition circulated against me among prominent people at Carnegie-Mellon, including some of the trustees.\n\nREDDY : There\u2019s another important person at the time, Pat Crecine (IM\u201961, IA\u201963,\u201966), who was a senior vice president. Pat came from the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, but he was strongly computer-oriented.\n\nJORDAN : Pat became the champion of the idea of a floating Department of Computer Science, which would report not particularly to one dean or another. Of course, he would also become the supervisor of it! He used the experience very effectively, because when he became president of Georgia Tech, he created the College of Computing, which was more or less a replica of what we were doing at Carnegie-Mellon.\n\nAlthough unusual, the concept of a free-floating department wasn\u2019t entirely without precedent at Carnegie Mellon, which dropped its hyphen in the mid-1980s. Statistics had started as a graduate program unaffiliated with any college before the formation of a Statistics Department within H&SS.\n\nSeparately, 1986 saw the creation of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center as a joint effort between CMU, the University of Pittsburgh and Westinghouse Electric Corp.\n\nJORDAN : The experiment of the free-floating department was successful. I was happy, Nico was happy, and the rest is history.\n\nREDDY : It took a year or two to decide on the structure of the college. Nico asked, \u201cDo you mind if robotics is part of (SCS), rather than reporting directly to the provost?\u201d I said, no. So the School of Computer Science became the Department of Computer Science, the Robotics Institute and the Center for Machine Translation.\n\nSCS also incorporated the remaining researchers from the Information Technology Center, which had developed Andrew.\n\nSIEWIOREK : There was some argument about how we should name the school, because there was confusion over the fact there was both a School of Computer Science and a Computer Science Department.\n\nJORDAN : Pat Crecine suggested, \u201cWhy not call it the School of Computing?\u201d Some other people said, \u201cWhy not the School of Informatics?\u201d Newell resisted that. He said, \u201cIt should be called the School of Computer Science.\u201d\n\nSCS makes its debut\n\nAlthough voicing some concerns, CMU\u2019s Faculty Senate in the fall of 1988 assented to Cyert\u2019s plan to elevate the Department of Computer Science to college status. On Dec. 13, 1988, Cyert told faculty and staff that Habermann had been appointed CMU\u2019s first Dean of Computer Science, effective Dec. 1, and that the School of Computer Science would soon begin operations. SCS made its formal debut on Dec. 22, 1988, with a reception in the Wherrett Room of Skibo Hall, CMU\u2019s student union. The official announcement of CMU\u2019s new \u201cgraduate School of Computer Science\u201d was made Jan. 3, 1989.\n\nSCOTT : They should have had an undergraduate program much earlier. At the time the need wasn\u2019t so recognized around the country, but it really was essential.\n\nSHAW : There were two things in question\u2014one was the level of university support, and the other one was, \u201cis the field mature enough for an undergraduate program?\u201d\n\nFor several years, undergraduates interested in computer science pursued an \u201capplied math/CS\u201d bachelor\u2019s degree offered by the Mathematics Department. Shaw led CMU\u2019s first effort to design an undergraduate curriculum solely in computer science. She and her colleagues were guided by the Carnegie Plan\u2014guidelines established in 1938 under Carnegie Tech President Robert Doherty (A\u201940, E\u201948, H\u201950), outlining the principles of a sound professional education.\n\nSHAW : The Carnegie Plan says, in substance, that an undergraduate education should include durable education in the ideas of the field. It should teach critical thinking \u2026 Yes, it should teach you some of the current skills, but to justify its place in the curriculum, any course needs to have durable intellectual content that will outlast a couple of changes in technology.\n\nThe undergraduate program started small, with seven CS majors admitted as sophomores during the 1989-90 academic year. Another 73 undergraduates were admitted in 1990\u201391. By 1995, there were 401 undergraduates in the School of Computer Science; in fall 2013, more than 600 undergraduates made up about 37 percent of student enrollment at SCS, along with more than 600 master\u2019s degree students.\n\nAlong the way, the Center for Machine Translation became the Language Technologies Institute, and other new departments formed, including the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (1993), the Institute for Software Research (1999), the Machine Learning Department (2006) and the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology (2009).\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nTRAUB : CMU is like China, in that when you visit China, if you come back 10 years later, it's an entirely new country, and they have completely reinvented themselves. CMU is the same way. Every time I come back here, I\u2019m thrilled by what\u2019s new. (My last visit) I was stunned by the Gates-Hillman complex \u2026 I sometimes ask myself, \u201cWould (SCS) even be here if we had not succeeded back in the 1970s?\u201d Because all it would have taken was one or two more people leaving, and we would have gone sub-critical, and that would have been the end of CMU as a power in computer science.\n\nSIEWIOREK : I think it would be nice to have some big projects again. Where\u2019s the next \u201cAndrew\u201d vision? Where\u2019s the next \u201cWireless Andrew\u201d vision? Maybe things are so diffuse now that it\u2019s not possible to come up with something like that to service all of campus. Those big, cohesive projects\u2014there don\u2019t seem to be many of them. Red Whittaker (E\u201975,\u201979) does some of that with his projects, and ideas such as model checking have certainly attracted a lot of interest. Maybe they\u2019re there, and it just takes longer for them to gain public recognition.\n\nREDDY : I\u2019ve been asking myself, what can we do that\u2019s unique and could actually transform the world 10 or 20 years from now? It could be software and algorithms. It may be things such as robotics, and learning, and language. But it\u2019s more narrow than all of computer science.\n\nSHAW : We have a couple of challenges. One is to do more research that directly connects with the things people actually do with their computers. HCII runs in that direction. We have people working on usable security, which addresses a particular slice of it. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve made much of a dent in the long-standing problem of people being unable to manage their own personal computers. We still have epidemics of infected machines, for instance, that no one has made backups for, and we\u2019re not doing a lot to help individuals control their own computing. Electronic medical records are another big opportunity that we are tantalizingly close to being engaged in. One of the big impediments there is data interchange, and heaven knows we\u2019ve got people who can deal with that.\n\nSCOTT : There are two things that seem important to me: First, the existence of the cloud and having distributed facilities in computing\u2014how to manage them, how to make sure they stay secure and operational\u2014there are a hundred interesting questions there about distributing resources and proper management of information retrieval and programming. Second, how to properly integrate computer resources into teaching is far from being solved. We\u2019re not really ready to produce well-designed courses, with people interacting remotely on computers, and integrating those into an academic degree, and it\u2019s going to take quite a while to iron that out.\n\nSIEWIOREK : The Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center was way out in front in that field, but then these sort of shallow investigations came along\u2014Massive Open Online Courses\u2014which are getting all of the press. The Simon Initiative is an opportunity for us, because it has two aspects\u2014the deeper science underneath, and a higher-level vision.\n\nREDDY : In the old days, a few people used to know a lot of things. Aristotle in the time of the ancient Greeks, for instance, could read and write when most people were ignorant of those skills. The same thing is happening in computer science. For the first 30 or 40 years, there was a small group of aristocracy in computer science, and we were at the top of the pyramid. When hardware was the king of computer science, we were the place to go. The democratization of computing means that everyone can have that kind of computing today at a fraction of the cost. The question is, what can we do that will still maintain our edge?\n\nFor More Information:\n\nJason Togyer | 412-268-8721 | jt3y@cs.cmu.edu\n\nYou must have JavaScript enabled to use this form."}
