Typically, one of these will be for an undergraduate class, and one for a graduate-level class. Also, one of the two TA-ships may be in some form of pre-approved \"alternate service\", such as an SCS \u201cv- unit.\u201d The Program Coordinator must be notified in advance of a TA-ship, or it may not be accepted. Students who are not native speakers of English are required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990 to pass the CMU ITA test prior to TA-ing. The\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 4\n\n\nfluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns, will be rated by Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA.\nThe full university policy can be reviewed at: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation- certification-english-fluency-instructors.html . The fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA.\nIn addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory screening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the SASC helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the Student Academic Success Center website for more information.\n3.2.3 The PhD Dissertation\nThe PhD dissertation is the defining feature of a PhD degree. The process has three main milestones:\nThesis Topic: During the PhD student\u2019s third year, the student should be working hard to find a thesis topic. The thesis topic typically develops from the directed research that the student has been carrying out with the student\u2019s advisor. The topic is a well-defined research problem that is interesting and unsolved, and for which the student has a believable proposed solution. When the dissertation is finished, there will be a \u201cthesis statement\u201d that describes the claimed solution to the research problem that is the thesis topic.\nThesis Proposal: Near the end of the student\u2019s third year, the student will compose a dissertation proposal. In this document, the student will specify the problem the research addresses (the thesis topic); the significance of the problem and expected scientific contributions; other relevant research, including competing approaches; some preliminary results; the work that still must be completed; evaluation metrics for that work; and a projected timeline for completion. Before presenting the proposal, the student will also secure approval for a dissertation committee, which consists of the student\u2019s advisor, at least two other SCS faculty members working in language technologies, and at least one external member. University rules require that the time and place of the proposal presentation be publicly announced at least one week before the presentation. The student should coordinate this with the PhD Program Coordinator. The public thesis proposal protects the student by guaranteeing that the proposed research is interesting to the larger scientific community and demonstrating that the student will finish the program if the work is completed as outlined.\nThesis Defense: The dissertation document itself, normally expected at the end of the fifth year, will include a detailed description of all the work done, including a clear evaluation and a discussion of its scientific contributions. There are no fixed style or document length guidelines or requirements; the only format requirement is that the title page should be\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 5\n\n\nsuitable to be issued as an LTI Technical Report. The dissertation defense is a public presentation and defense of the dissertation results. Note: University rules again require that the time and place of the dissertation defense be publicly announced at least one week prior to the defense. This should also be coordinated with PhD Program Coordinator.\nNOTE: At the time of the public announcement, a draft of the thesis document must be made available online.\n3.2.4 Research Speaking Requirement\nTo emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills and increase internal awareness of LTI work, all LTI PhD students must complete an oral presentation at the LTI each year (by the end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20-minute talk plus time for discussion. It must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the public will be invited. (The thesis proposal and defense each count towards this requirement.)\nAt least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor. After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery.\n3.2.5 Withdrawal of a Degree\nThe University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html\n3.3 Advising\nEach student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed study projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.\nHow and when the advisor is selected: the Matching Process: Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (\u201cImmigration Course\u201d, or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a first, second and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a \"Marriage Committee\" to determine the best set of matches.\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 6\n\n\nUntil a student finds a specific advisor, the PhD Program Director serves as the advisor.\nHow to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem (assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time.\n3.4 Process for completing a Master\u2019s Degree enroute to a PhD\nThe LTI always allows our PhD students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master\u2019s degree to receive the master\u2019s degree without any additional work. Please see the MLT Handbook since the requirements for the MLT coursework are a bit more detailed.\n3.5 Definitions of LTI Terminology\nWe define here some of the terms as used in this handbook:\nAn \u201cLTI course\u201d is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with 11-XXX counts as one-half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that we will allow any one MLD (10-XXX) graduate course to count as an \"LTI course\".\nAn \u201cSCS course\u201d is any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6-unit course with such a number counts as one-half of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended electives that are technically outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Digital Signal Processing in ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as \u201cSCS.\u201d\n\u201cLTI Focus Areas\u201d are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under \u201cCourse Categories.\u201d If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should notify the PhD Program Director. They will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area, and if approved it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage.\nA \u201cTask-Orientation Focus Course\u201d is simply a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on the \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage.\nAn LTI \u201clab course\u201d is simply a course in the list of lab courses defined in the LTI \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage.\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 7\n\n\n3.6 Recommended Electives outside of SCS\nStudents are free to take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross-registered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requirements of their program as described above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor; typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses.\nNote: recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the \u201cSCS\u201d course requirement. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as \u201cSCS.\nNote also that students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., summer courses). The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (\u201cB\u201d is the minimum for PhD, \u201cC\u201d for MLT).\n3.7 LTI Orientation (\u201cThe Immigration Course\u201d or \u201cThe IC\u201d)\nAt the beginning of each Fall semester, the LTI provides 2-3 weeks of lectures and talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and treat them as seriously as a course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however, the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.\nFor many years, these talks were called \"the Immigration Course (IC).\" The intuition behind this name is that the talks help orient newly-arrived students \u2013 immigrants into the CMU environment. As a result, some students understood the name to indicate that the talks would be about US immigration and visa requirements. The older name has been retired; however, people who have been at CMU a long time may occasionally use the older name.\n3.8 End of Semester Evaluation\nNear the end of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes his or her achievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester.\nAt the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degree.\nA good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual.\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 8\n\n\nIf a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \"black mark\" on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.\nIn the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.\n3.9 Enrollment Verification\nIndividuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required.\nFor more information, please see CMU\u2019s:\nGuidance for Completing the Form I-9 and EVerify Requirements at CMU (pdf), \u2022 or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9.\n3.10 Withdrawal of a Degree\nThe University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html\n3.11 University Policies on Grades and Grading\n3.11.1 University Policy on Grades\nGrading - University Policies - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu)\nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.\nProcess for Appealing Final Grades\nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit, or program.\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 9\n\n\nGrading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university policy.\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and-academic- actions.html\n3.11.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses\nTransfer Credit Evaluation and Assignment - University Policies - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu)\nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows:\nCarnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be considered for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations.\n(Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this.)\n3.12 Academic Integrity\nIn the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.\nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society.\nCarnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society; to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem- solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 10\n\n\ndiverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.\nIn any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.\nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html)\nThe policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.\nA review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures is also recommended.\nImportant note: The LTI implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.\u201d Our procedure is as follows: a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide not to immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation.\nIf the student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.\nThese procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process. Please see http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/documents/academic-disciplinary-actions- overview-for-graduate-students.2013.pdf\nAppeals of Course-Level Action - The Word - Student Handbook - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu) for more information.\n3.13 Employment Eligibility Verification\nStudents who are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment).\nAdditional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf] covering the university\u2019s I-9 and E-Verify requirements: \u2022 Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment. Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required.\n\nFor more information, please see CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 11\n\n\nRequirements at CMU [pdf], or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9.\n4\nAcademic Policies\n4.1 PhD Academic Policies\n4.1.1 Duration of Study\nThe target duration of the LTI PhD is five years. Doctoral students who require an extended period to complete their degree requirements must consult with their academic program, and are subject to the CMU Policy on Doctoral Student Status (www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student-life/doctoral-student-status.html), specifically the \u201cTime to Degree\u201d section. See also the \u201cStatute of Limitations\u201d policy.\n4.1.2 Double-Dipping\nAn LTI PhD student who uses courses taken as a master\u2019s student (here at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other master\u2019s degree offered by the school. The LTI (like other SCS units) always allows our PhD students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master\u2019s degree to receive the master\u2019s degree without any additional work. Any other sharing of coursework by an LTI student between more than one CMU degree (e.g., receiving an MLD Master\u2019s degree that includes courses taken as an LTI PhD student) must be explicitly approved by the LTI, on a case-by-case basis, in advance.\n4.1.3 ABD versus ABD in Absentia (ABS)\nFollowing university policy, an LTI PhD student is considered \"All-But-Dissertation\" (ABD) when they have completed all requirements for the LTI's PhD degree except for the thesis defense (in particular, the student has had a thesis proposal accepted). Note that ABD status is different from ABD in absentia (ABS) status. A student in ABS status cannot receive any support from the university (including any research projects within the university), cannot use most university facilities, and does not pay any tuition until they are ready to defend their thesis. ABS students must register for five (5) units of dissertation research in the semester they defend; in keeping with university policy, the LTI (and its projects and faculty) cannot pay for these five units. The student can (and should) register for these five units only after they defend; just in case the defense date slips to the next semester.\n4.1.4 University Policy for Doctoral Student Status\nThis policy sets forth a definition of All But Dissertation (ABD) status, time limits on doctoral candidacy status, a definition of being In Residence and In Absentia for candidates and the tuition and fees charged for candidates in each status. The ABD Status Agreement Form\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 12\n\n\n4.1.5 External Internships\nThe LTI guarantees summer support for its PhD students, so we expect them to work on research at Carnegie Mellon during the summer. Because we recognize that outside experience can be a valuable educational experience, we do allow PhD students to accept a minimum of one external internship during their PhD studies, provided they are in good standing. Because some students can benefit from more than one internship, especially if they require access to proprietary data for their work, with the approval of the student\u2019s advisor they can intern 3-4 times during their PhD degree program. Interning more than 4 times requires approval from the PhD Program Director.\nAny internship must be planned in consultation with the student\u2019s advisor and the LTI PhD Graduate Coordinator. If an internship is part of a fully- funded external fellowship (e.g., Microsoft Research Fellowship), the student does not need prior LTI approval, but should still coordinate with their advisor. International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract.\nInternships are typically scheduled during the summer. In certain cases, it is possible to schedule an internship during the fall or spring semester; the details are complex, especially for international students, so the student should discuss this as early as possible with the Program Director of LTI Graduate Programs. International students must coordinate carefully with the LTI in any event, due to visa restrictions.\nNote that self-funded PhD students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester internship) are"}
