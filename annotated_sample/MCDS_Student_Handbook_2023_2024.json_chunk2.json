However, some students may wish to be a teaching assistant. MCDS students may petition for approval to TA up to one course per semester provided that they are in good academic standing (Overall QPA 3.0 or above).\nAs required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990, graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns.\nThe full university policy can be reviewed at:\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency- instructors.html.\nIn addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (mandatory screening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/\n3.3.28 Internship Requirement and Search for Full Time Employment\nAn internship is required for the degree program. In some cases, when a student has prior work experience, the Director of the degree program may waive this requirement. Students start searching for internships generally in the Fall and Spring semesters. Once the student returns from an internship in the Fall, they should immediately begin the search resources are available at http://www.cmu.edu/career/ including a resume submission system, a list of employers, on campus interviews and mock interviews, and many other resources.\nfor\nfull\ntime employment.

Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB via this link: http://www.cmu.edu/hub/transcripts/verifications/enrollment.html\n3.5 University Policies on Grades and Grading\n3.6.1 University Policy on Grades\nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.\nYou can review the university grading policies here: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html\n3.6.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses\nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university\u2019s cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department\u2019s policies allow this.)\nYou can review the university policy here: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html\n3.6 Academic Integrity\n3.7.1 Expectations Regarding Proper Conduct\nIn the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports\n24\n\n\ndiscussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.\nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.\nIn any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.\nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html). The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.\nA review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html) is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.\n3.7.2 Protocol for Academic Integrity Violations\nThe university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures and the appeal process for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged academic integrity violation.\nFor more information on disciplinary actions please see:\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/acad_standards/creative/disciplinary.html\nFurther documentation on how to respond to an allegation of a violation as a graduate student:\n25\n\n\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/academic-integrity/grads.html\nImportant Note: MCDS implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program\u201d. We have adopted the following hearing procedure and \u201ctwo strikes\u201d rule:\n\nIf an instructor determines that an academic integrity violation has occurred, both the instructor and students are given the opportunity to explain the situation to the MCDS program committee. A written hearing by email suffices for this purpose.\nThe program committee then reviews all information and decides whether the violation is deemed an infraction (see 3.3.17), and which secondary actions are to be taken on the program level.\nTwo-Strike-Rule: MCDS may dismiss students upon a first AIV infraction. A second infraction will always lead to the offending student being dismissed from the program, with no exceptions.\nThe MCDS program reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, the degree will be withdrawn promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this university policy https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- at: life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html\nis\navailable\n4 Academic Policies\n4.1 MCDS Academic Policies\n4.1.1 Duration of Study\nMCDS students enrolled for full-time studies are normally expected to complete the degree in three semesters (16 months). This includes a summer internship.\n4.1.2 Double-Dipping\nA Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval.\n4.1.3 Pass/Fail and Audit Grades\nPass/fail and audit grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail or audit option for these courses.\n26\n\n\n4.1.4 Transfer Credit\nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another institution, may be permitted to satisfy one of the MCDS course requirements, with permission from the Director. Students must petition for transfer credit by providing the Program Director with the prior course syllabus and other details that may be required by the Director in order to make a decision. See the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption\u201d. NOTE: In all cases, credit may only be transferred from another degree program for courses deemed \u201cfree electives\u201d - i.e., courses which were not used to satisfy a core requirement or total units requirement in a prior degree program.\nAll MS students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU.\n4.1.5 External Internships and Job Interviewing\nMCDS students are expected to attain an external internship during the summer. International students must coordinate carefully with the University, due to visa restrictions. International students are required to consult with the Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract.\nWe caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) implications with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their academic advisor before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your own inventions if they occur during an external internship.\nWhile it is necessary for students to travel off-campus for job interviews, it is not acceptable for a student to miss a course requirement or a capstone project commitment due to interview travel. Students should work proactively with prospective employers to arrange interview travel in a way that minimizes the impact on their final semester course work.\n4.1.6 Transferring into the MCDS Program\nDirect transfers into the MCDS program are not permitted. Students who are currently enrolled at Carnegie Mellon who wish to transfer into the MCDS program must do so by applying to the MCDS program via the normal admissions process. As specified in Sec. 4.1.4 in this document, some transfer credit and/or exemption from MCDS requirements may be possible on a case-by-case basis.\n4.1.7 Transferring Out of the MCDS Program\nThe MCDS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MCDS degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired\n27\n\n\ndegree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to request such a transfer.\n4.1.8 Statute of Limitations\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html\nAs outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations (link above), students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program.\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.\n4.2 LTI Academic Policies\n4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy\nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. In unusual cases, the Director may approve exceptions to the program requirements.\n4.2.2 Course Drop/Add/withdrawal procedures\nStudents taking undergraduate and Master\u2019s level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes/index.html.\nThere is a separate calendar for masters level courses.\n4.2.3 Courses with restricted enrollment\nMCDS students have priority for the program core courses. The MCDS program administrators cannot intercede with other departments to secure seats for its students in other courses as all departments reserve seats for their accepted students. Usually all Students can, remaining open seats are assigned on a first- come, first-served basis.\n28\n\n\non occasion, contact the assigned course instructor in order to plead his/her case for admission to the course. Admission may be granted at the discretion of the instructor. The policy of the department offering the course(s) is always followed.\n4.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption\nThe LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the Director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.\n4.2.5 External Employment/Consulting\nSince the MCDS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment and/or consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss this with their advisor. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment.\n4.2.6 Leave of Absence\nA student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor.
