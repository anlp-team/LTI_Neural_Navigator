Typically, offices are shared with other Ph.D. students, but they may also be shared with staff, visitors, or other members of the LTI.\nOffices are assigned by the LTI\u2019s Office Manager (see Section 1.2, Department Personnel, for contact information).\n2.3 Mailboxes and Office Supplies\nMailboxes and office supplies are in GHC 5404.\n2.4 Photocopies and Printers\nPrinters and photocopies are available to LTI students. The use of a photocopier or printer requires you to log in with your CMU ID card. LTI students may use printers/photocopiers scattered throughout the School of Computer Science buildings, but the machines in GHC 5404 and GHC 6604 are the most convenient. The SCS Computing Facilities publishes a list of printers online at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printer-list.\n2.5 Computers for LTI Ph.D. Students\nPh.D. students are responsible for having their own laptop computers to support their education and research. Students are free to choose their own operating system (e.g., Linux, MacOs, Windows).\nMany Ph.D. advisors also provide access to computer clusters, cloud computing, or other resources to support computationally-intense research.\nPh.D. students are given access to the LTI\u2019s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or capstone projects. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.\nPh.D. students receive two types of user ids: An Andrew id and a CS id. All CMU students have an Andrew id. Computer Science students also have a CS id that provides access to SCS-specific resources (e.g., computer clusters). CS ids are being phased out very slowly, so it is likely that you will need both types of user id.\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 13\n\n\nThe School of Computer Science has a Help Center in GHC 4201. It can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu , extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line (M-F, 9am-5pm).\n3\nStandard Degree Requirements & Degree Certification\n3.1\nLTI Ph.D. Degree Requirements\nTo complete the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must satisfy the following requirements:\nPass at least 96 units of graduate level courses, with additional requirements detailed below;\nSatisfy proficiencies in Writing, Presentation, Programming, and Teaching; \u2022 Propose, write, and defend a Ph.D. dissertation (thesis); \u2022 Attend the LTI Colloquium (11-700) each semester; and \u2022 Satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement.\nThe sections below provide more detail about each of these requirements.\n3.1.1 Course Requirements\nTo complete the course requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must pass 96 or more course units of graduate courses, and meet the following criteria:\nAt least 72 units of \u201cLTI\u201d courses and 24 units of \u201cSCS\u201d courses, \u2022 At least one class in each \u201cLTI Focus Area\u201d, and \u2022 At least two labs, in two different research areas.\nFor definitions of quoted terms, see the section on \u201cDefinitions of LTI Terminology\u201d.\nUnless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.\nAn \u201cLTI course\u201d is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with 11-XXX counts as one-half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI allows any one MLD (10-XXX) graduate course to count as an \"LTI course\".\nAn \u201cSCS course\u201d is any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6-unit course with such a number counts as one-half of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended electives that are technically\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 14\n\n\noutside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Digital Signal Processing in ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as \u201cSCS.\u201d\n\u201cLTI Focus Areas\u201d are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under \u201cCourse Categories.\u201d If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should make a request to the Ph.D. Program Director. They will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area. If approved, it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage.\nA \u201cTask-Orientation Focus Course\u201d is a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on the LTI\u2019s \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage.\nAn LTI \u201clab course\u201d is a course in the list of lab courses defined on the LTI\u2019s \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage.\n3.1.2 Grade Requirements\nStudents must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed study by satisfying the following grade requirements.\nMinimum grade: Only courses with a grade of B (3.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree requirement.\nPass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement.\n3.1.3 Proficiency Requirements\nThe LTI Ph.D. does not require any Qualifying Exams. Instead, a LTI Ph.D. student is required to demonstrate proficiency in the following four areas.\nWriting: This is satisfied by producing a peer-reviewed conference paper, or the equivalent (a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference- paper quality).\nPresentation: This is satisfied by the oral presentation of a conference paper, or the equivalent (an oral presentation that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference-talk quality).\nProgramming: This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming of language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research and/or project work.\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 15\n\n\nTeaching: This is satisfied by two (2) successful Teaching Assistantships (TA-ships), as determined by the faculty member for whom the student serves as TA. Typically, one of these will be for an undergraduate class, and one for a graduate-level class. One of the two TA-ships may be in some form of pre-approved \"alternate service\", such as an SCS \u201cv-unit.\u201d\nThe Program Coordinator must be notified in advance of a TA-ship, or it may not be accepted.\nGraduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full university policy can be reviewed at:\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-instructors.html\nThe fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA.\nIn addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory screening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the Student Academic Success Center website for additional information:\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-success/\n3.1.4 The Ph.D. Dissertation\nThe Ph.D. dissertation is the defining feature of a Ph.D. degree. The process of completing a Ph.D. dissertation has three important milestones.\nThesis Topic: During the Ph.D. student\u2019s third year, the student should be working hard to find a thesis topic. The thesis topic typically develops from the directed research that the student has been carrying out with the student\u2019s advisor. The topic is a well-defined research problem that is interesting and unsolved, and for which the student has a believable proposed solution. When the dissertation is finished, there will be a \u201cthesis statement\u201d that describes the claimed solution to the research problem that is the thesis topic.\nThesis Proposal: Near the end of the student\u2019s third year, the student will compose a dissertation proposal. In this document, the student will specify the problem the research addresses (the thesis topic); the significance of the problem and expected scientific contributions; other relevant research, including competing approaches; some preliminary results; the work that still must be completed; evaluation metrics for that work; and a\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 16\n\n\nprojected timeline for completion. Before presenting the proposal, the student will also secure approval for a dissertation committee, which consists of the student\u2019s advisor, at least two other SCS faculty members working in language technologies, and at least one external member.\nUniversity rules require that the time and place of the proposal presentation be publicly announced at least one week before the presentation. The student should coordinate this with the Ph.D. Program Coordinator. The public thesis proposal protects the student by guaranteeing that the proposed research is interesting to the larger scientific community and demonstrating that the student will finish the program if the work is completed as outlined.\nThesis Defense: The dissertation document itself, normally expected at the end of the fifth year, will include a detailed description of all the work done, including a clear evaluation and a discussion of its scientific contributions. There are no fixed style or document length guidelines or requirements; the only format requirement is that the title page should be suitable to be issued as an LTI Technical Report. The dissertation defense is a public presentation and defense of the dissertation results. Note: University rules again require that the time and place of the dissertation defense be publicly announced at least one week prior to the defense. This should also be coordinated with Ph.D. Program Coordinator.\nNote: At the time of the public announcement, a draft of the thesis document must be made available online.\n3.1.5 Research Speaking Requirement\nTo emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills and increase internal awareness of LTI work, all LTI Ph.D. students must complete an oral presentation at the LTI each year (by the end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20-minute talk plus time for discussion. It must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the public will be invited. (The thesis proposal and defense each count towards this requirement.)\nAt least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor. After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery.\n3.2 Advising\nEach student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 17\n\n\nstudy projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.\nHow and when the advisor is selected (The Matching Process): Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation lectures, (Section 3.3) in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a first, second and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a \"Matching Committee\" to determine the best set of matches.\nUntil a student finds a specific advisor, the Program Director of the LTI graduate programs serves as the advisor.\nHow to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem (assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time.\n3.3 LTI Orientation\nAt the beginning of each Fall semester, the LTI provides 2-3 weeks of lectures and talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and treat them as seriously as a standard course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however, the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.\nFor many years, these talks were called \"the Immigration Course (IC).\" The intuition behind this name is that the talks help orient newly-arrived students \u2013 immigrants into the CMU environment. As a result, some students understood the name to indicate that the talks would be about US immigration and visa requirements. The older name has been retired; however, people who have been at CMU a long time may occasionally use the older name.\n3.4 End of Semester Evaluation\nNear the end of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes his or her achievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester.\nAt the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 18\n\n\nthe faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degree.\nA good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual.\nIf a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \"black mark\" on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.\nIn the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an \u201cN-1\u201d letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.\n3.5 Electives Outside of SCS\nStudents may take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross-registered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requirements of their program as described above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor. Typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses.\nStudents interested in taking recommended electives outside the SCS should pay particular attention to the following issues.\nRecommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the \u201cSCS\u201d course requirement. Please see the Program Director for approval of an elective as an \u201cSCS course\u201d.\nStudents need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., summer courses).\nThe grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (\u201cB\u201d is the minimum for Ph.D.).\n3.6 Completing an M.S. Degree Enroute to a Ph.D.\nCourses that satisfy LTI Ph.D. degree requirements may also be used to satisfy requirements for one M.S. degree. The most common choice is the LTI\u2019s Master of Language Technologies (MLT) degree because its requirements are similar (but not identical) to the Ph.D. requirements. Other M.S. degrees within the LTI and outside of the LTI are also possible.\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 19\n\n\nStudents interested in an M.S. degree other than the MLT degree should discuss their plans with their Ph.D. advisor due to the additional courses and project work that may be involved.\n3.7 Grading and Evaluation\n3.7.1 University Policy on Grades\nCarnegie Mellon\u2019s Grading policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.\nProcess for Appealing Final Grades\nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit, or program.\nGrading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university policy.\nSee the university\u2019s Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures web page information. https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of- for more grades-and-academic-actions.html\n3.7.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit- evaluation-and-assignment.html\nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations.\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 20\n\n\n3.8 Academic Integrity\nIn the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.\nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society.\nCarnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: To create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society; to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem- solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.\nIn any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.\nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity.\nThe policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.\nA review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures is also recommended.\nImportant note: The LTI implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.\u201d Our procedure is as follows: A first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide not to immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation.\nIf the student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.\nThese procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.\nPlease see the Appeals of Course Level Action section of The Word and the Office of Community Standards & Integrity web page for more information.\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 21\n\n\n3.9 Withdrawal of a Degree\nThe University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. See the university\u2019s Withdrawal of a Degree policy for more information.\n3.10 Employment Eligibility Verification\nIf you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf] covering the university\u2019s I-9 and E-Verify requirements:\nEvery individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment.\n\nIndividuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required.\nFor more information, please see CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E- Verify Requirements at CMU [pdf], or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9.\nStudents who fail to complete the Form I-9 in a timely manner may have stipend payments suspended. If employed by the university, an individual who fails to timely complete the Form I-9 may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.\nFor more information:\nSee CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU, or\nVisit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9.\u201d\n3.11 Additional Guidance for Students\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 22\n\n\n3.11.1 Program of Study\nStudents seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.\n3.11.2 Financial Aid and Student Account\nStudents are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enroll"
