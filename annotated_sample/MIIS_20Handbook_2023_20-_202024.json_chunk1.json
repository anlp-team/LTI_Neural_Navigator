Laptops running Windows, MacOS, and Linux software are all acceptable.\nMaster\u2019s students will be given a CS user id. A CS user id is required to use the LTI computer cluster, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science has a Help Center located at\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 10\n\n\nGHC 4201. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu, extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line.\nMS students will be given access to the LTI\u2019s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.\n3 CMU Degree Completion and Certification\n3.1 Standard Degree Requirements & Degree Certification\nCarnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary significantly ranging from two semesters for some full-time master\u2019s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.\nEarly Completion Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances.\nExtended or Longer-than-Standard Completion Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.\nMaster\u2019s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program, and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. Students shall reference CMU Policy on Master\u2019s Student Statute of Limitations: www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of limitations.html regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time allowable for master\u2019s degree completion and certification.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 11\n\n\n3.2 Statute of Limitations\nAs outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations, https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program.\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.\n3.3 Additional Guidance for Students\nProgram of Study Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.\nFinancial Aid and Student Account Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs.\nInternational Students Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 12\n\n\n4 MIIS Degree Requirements and Related Policies/Protocols\n4.1 Program Options\nThe MIIS degree is offered in two options:\nOption 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.\nOption 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.\nMIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration:\nHuman Language for Language Technologies \u2022 Language Technology Application \u2022 Machine Learning for Language Technologies\nPart-time options are available in some cases.\n4.2 Required Units for Degree Attainment\nTo complete the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems, a student must satisfy three types of requirements. Curricular requirements ensure that MIIS students receive instruction in core intelligent information systems technologies while also allowing an opportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest. Practice requirements are opportunities to apply and hone new skills while building state-of-the-art systems. Grade requirements ensure that students have demonstrated a certain level of skill while completing degree requirements. All three types of requirements are described below.\nMIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12-unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements and 66 practice units for a total of 150 units to attain the Standard MIIS degree.\nMIIS-21 students must take at least 108 units (typically 9 12-unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses and 66 practice units to satisfy their degree requirements, making it a total of 174 units to attain the MIIS: Advanced Study degree.\n4.3 Core Requirements\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 13\n\n\nA MIIS student must complete the following curricular requirements:\n1. Qualifying courses:\nMIIS-16 students must pass 72 units (typically 6 12-unit courses) and MIIS-21 students must complete 96 units (typically 8 12-unit courses) in qualifying master\u2019s courses.\nA qualifying master\u2019s course is defined as:\na. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies\nInstitute; and\nb. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) from the list of approved qualifying\ncourses (Section 3.2.4).\n2.

A graduate course (600-level or higher) with content relevant to the MIIS\nprogram objectives offered by the School of Computer Science; and\nb. A course approved by the student's advisor and the degree Program Director. c. A student may not use the same course to satisfy both a qualifying course\nrequirement and an elective course requirement.\n3. Breadth requirements: Students must demonstrate breadth by passing one course in each of the following areas. In addition, MIIS-21 students must take two more LTI courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas of concentration:\nHuman language; \u2022 Machine learning; and \u2022 Language technology applications.\nThe department maintains and publishes a list of courses that satisfy each of these requirements (Sections 3.2.5 \u2013 3.2.7). Some courses used to satisfy a breadth requirement can also satisfy qualifying course requirements. A student should get approval from the director for the breadth courses, if not listed below.\n4.4 Approved Qualifying Courses\nAny graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is a qualifying course.\nAny two graduate courses (600-level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS relevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 14\n\n\nAny course from the following list is an approved qualifying course.\n02-712, Computational Methods for Biological Modeling and Simulation \u2022 05-631, Software Structures for User interfaces \u2022 05-813, Human Factors \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 10-708, Probabilistic Graphical Models 16-720, Computer Vision 17-631 Information Security, Privacy & Policy 17-781, Mobile and IoT Computing Services\n4.4.1 Breadth Courses: Human Language\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n11-611, Natural Language Processing 11-624, Human Language for Artificial Intelligence 11-711, Advanced NLP 11-722, Grammar Formalisms 11-724, Human Language for Artificial Intelligence 11-727, Computational Semantics for NLP 11-737, Multilingual NLP\n4.4.2 Breadth Courses: Language Technology Applications\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n11-642, Search Engines 11-688, Concepts in Digital Multimedia and Cyber Forensics 11-692, Speech Processing 11-697.

Directed study requirement: Students must pass 24 units (typically 12 units x 2 semesters) in directed study under the supervision of their advisor. Directed study is a structured, task-oriented form of independent study that provides deep, hands-on experience in a particular technology area and an opportunity to work closely with a member of the faculty.\n2. Internship requirement: Students must complete a one-semester (typically summer) internship at an organization (typically a company or government agency) approved by the MIIS Program Director. Internships are an opportunity to apply new skills in a professional setting and to learn about software development in a \u2018real world\u2019 organization. Students with prior professional experience may petition the MIIS Program Director to waive this requirement. MIIS students that do an internship during the summer semester are required to present their internship at a poster session at the beginning of the following Fall semester. The poster and the student\u2019s participation in the poster session are part of the internship requirement. Participation is required unless waived in writing by the MIIS Program Director.\n3. Capstone requirements: Students must complete a capstone project (36 units) and a capstone planning seminar (6 units). The capstone requirement gives students experience with collaborative, team-oriented software development; significant hands- on experience with the techniques studied in the classroom; and an opportunity to work on a large software application. a. The capstone project (36 units) is a large, group-oriented demonstration of student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically, the result of the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project is supervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly basis to monitor progress and provide guidance.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 16\n\n\nb. The capstone planning seminar (6 units) organizes students into groups; defines capstone project goals, requirements, success metrics, and deliverables; and identifies and acquires data, software, and other resources required for successful completion of the project. The planning seminar must be completed in the semester prior to taking the capstone project.\n4.6 Registration Process/Procedures\nStudents are responsible for registering for their courses. Use the Stellic Degree Audit Application to monitor your progress and plan your degree. Students can search for relevant courses in a number of ways and share your plan with your advisor directly through the application.\nNavigate to the SIO Academic Info tab and select Enrollment Status and the upcoming\nsemester to confirm the following:\nEnrollment Status is 'Eligible to Enroll' (if not, email thehub@andrew.cmu.edu) \u2022 Maximum units for which you can plan to register for (overloads are reviewed and permitted only after registration week)\nClass Level, College and Department are correct (if incorrect, please contact your home\nacademic department)\nThe registration process can be completed within SIO (Student Information Online) by following 4 easy steps: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/docs/4-easy-steps.pdf\nIf students have any questions about course selection, students may reach out to MIIS program director, Teruko Mitamura.\n4.7 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures\nStudents taking undergraduate and master\u2019s level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course- changes/index.html. Please note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does not apply to Masters\u2019 students.\n4.8 Transfer Courses and Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE)\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 17\n\n\nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross- registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will not be considered for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations.\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html\nNOTE: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department's policies allow this.\n4.9 Internships\nIf the experience will have units attached to it, the program should have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. Students are responsible for identifying and applying for internships on their own. The LTI and the university provide several types of support for students seeking internships.\nAn annual poster session helps spread information from MIIS students that recently completed internships to MIIS students that will soon seek internships; other LTI professional master\u2019s programs have similar internship-oriented poster sessions that MIIS students may attend. The university offers resume-writing and interviewing workshops to help prepare students and fall and spring employment fairs to help students connect with companies. The university\u2019s Career & Professional Development Center https://www.cmu.edu/career/ provides other services as well.\nIf a student cannot find an internship, the MIIS program will arrange an on-campus internship with a university-based project. This internship may be unpaid.\nInternational students are required to consult with Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract (required addition to ensure the university is in compliance with immigration laws for F & J status students).\n4.10 Advising\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 18\n\n\nEach student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed study projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.\nHow and when the advisor is selected: Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. Typically, if a student and faculty member agree to enter an advising relationship, it is approved by the Program Director. If a student has not found an advisor after one month in the program, the Program Director will assign an advisor to the student.\nHow to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem, assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here. It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time.\n4.11 LTI Orientation\nPrior to the beginning of each Fall semester the LTI provides lectures and faculty research talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and to treat them as seriously as a course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. Students do not have to register for the LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks, nor do they receive a grade, however the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.\nThe LTI Orientation Canvas course is a mandatory course designed to increase incoming LTI graduate students' awareness and understanding of CMU's community standards and the resources that CMU offers the students. The course includes several administrative tasks, training, and educational sessions. The students will be enrolled into the course by the program administrator in early August. All MIIS students are expected to complete all assignments by the end of their first semester in the program. Each assignment has its own due date.\n4.12 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures\nGraduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 19\n\n\nprocesses available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program.\nSummary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures - Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu)\n4.13 Intellectual Property Policy\nThe MIIS degree program adheres to Carnegie Mellon University policy on intellectual property: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html\n5 Grading and Evaluation\n5.1 Grading Scale/System\nStudents must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed study and capstone projects by satisfying the following grade requirements:\n1. Minimum grade: A student must obtain a B- or better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student receives a C or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree requirements.\n2. Minimum QPA: A student must maintain an average QPA of at least 3.0 in courses and projects used to satisfy degree requirements.\n3. Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.\n5.2 Pass/Fail Grades\nPass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement, except for the 11-696 (A) Capstone Planning Seminar and 11-935 (R) LTI Practicum that are a Pass/Fail.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 20\n\n\nGraduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.\n5.3 Independent Study\nAn independent study can be counted as an Elective course, but it cannot be counted as a Qualifying course.\n5.4 University Policy on Grades\nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html\n5.5 Process for Appealing Final Grades\nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university policy.\nSummary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures - Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu)\n5.6 Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses\nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions.
