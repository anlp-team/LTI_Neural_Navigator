It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas.\nIf the experience will have units attached to it the program should have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units, they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc.\n4.1.6 Maximum Courseload\nIn order to encourage PhD students to focus on research, PhD students are permitted to register for 54 units of actual coursework per semester.\n4.1.7 Pass/Fail Grades\nPass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement.\nGraduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 13\n\n\n4.1.8 Transfer Credit\nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the PhD course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the PhD Program Director.\nTypically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision.\nSee the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption.\u201d\n4.1.9 Residency Requirements\nThe university requires PhDs to spend at least one year of residency at Carnegie Mellon.\nThe SCS requires that all PhD students must take at Carnegie Mellon a minimum of 36 units of the total coursework required by their respective programs.\n4.1.10 Transferring Into the PhD Program\nThe LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master\u2019s programs into its PhD program. The student must apply for the PhD at the usual time. However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities.\n4.1.11 Transferring Out of the PhD Program\nThe PhD program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. A student who is interested in transferring out of the PhD degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.\n4.1.12 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures\nAdd, drop, withdrawal and pass/no pass election deadlines may be found on the official Doctoral course-sections Academic Calendar.\nDoctoral students, visiting/non-degree students, and certificate students do not receive vouchers and do not participate in the voucher process.\n4.1.13 Statute of Limitations: Time to Degree\nAs outlined in the Doctoral Student Status Policy, students will complete all requirements for the PhD degree within a maximum of ten years from original matriculation as a doctoral student, or less if required by a more restrictive department or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a doctoral degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered doctoral degree program under criteria determined by that program.\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 14\n\n\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students, who are pursuing the PhD degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department\u2019s recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption.\nStudents, who are pursuing the PhD degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.\n4.2 LTI Academic Policies\n4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy\nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.\n4.2.2 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption\nThe LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program.\nIf a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective.\nThe student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place.\nIf a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.\n4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting\nStudents funded by LTI research projects are expected to work primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 15\n\n\none day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE); otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status. See also External Internships.\n4.2.4 Leave of Absence\nThe LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.\nStudents taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university\u2019s leave of absence process, which is described at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/leaves-and- returns/index.html\n4.2.5 Satisfactory Progress\nIf a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on \u201cEnd of Semester Evaluation.\u201d\n4.2.6 Winter and Summer Breaks\nStudents supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is typically allowed in the summer.\nThe normal winter break policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks and takes vacation for the other two weeks.\n4.3 CMU Academic Policies\n4.3.1 University Financial Aid\nGraduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website: https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html. Students will find the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links.\nInternational Students\u201d Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than- standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 16\n\n\n4.3.2 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities\nThe Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience.

This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program.\n4.3.4 Safeguarding Educational Equity: Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault\nThe University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence, and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith.\nThe University\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual-misconduct/index.html\nThe University\u2019s Policy Against Retaliation is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html\nIf you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources:\nOffice of Title IX Initiatives: 412-268-7125, http://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/ , tix@cmu.edu \u2022 University Police: 412-268-2323 or \u25cb https://www.cmu.edu/police/\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 17\n\n\nAdditional resources and information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources-and-information/index.html\n4.3.5 Childbirth/Maternity Accommodation Protocol\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of the semester may consider taking time away from their coursework and/or research responsibilities. All female students who give birth to a child while engaged in coursework or research are eligible to take either a short-term absence or formal leave of absence. Students are encouraged to consult with relevant university faculty and staff as soon as possible as they begin making plans regarding time away.\nStudents in course work should consider either working with their course instructor to receive incomplete grades or elect to drop to part-time status or to take a semester leave of absence.\nStudents engaged in research must work with their faculty to develop plans for the research for the time they are away.\nStudents must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations. Students will complete an information form and meet with a member of the Dean\u2019s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student.\nPlanning for the student\u2019s discussion with her academic contact(s) (advisor, associate dean, etc.) may be reviewed during this meeting.\nDoctoral students who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) weeks during a Short-Term Maternity Accommodation or a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks if an absence longer than six weeks is medically necessary. To receive this support students must be registered with the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs for maternity accommodation. 4.3.6 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate Students\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html This policy addresses romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited.
