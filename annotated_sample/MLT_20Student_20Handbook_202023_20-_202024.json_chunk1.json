The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.\n3 Master\u2019s Degree Completion and Certification\n3.1 Standard Degree Requirements and Degree Certification\n3.1.1 Graduate Students\nCarnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary significantly-- ranging from two semesters for some full-time master\u2019s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.\n3.1.2 Early Completion\nGraduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 11\n\n\n3.1.3 Extended or Longer-than-Standard Completion (Statute of Limitations)\nLonger-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.\nMaster\u2019s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program, and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. Students shall reference CMU Policy on Master\u2019s Student Statute of Limitations (www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of limitations.html) regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time allowable for master\u2019s degree completion and certification.\n3.1.4 Additional Guidance for Students\nProgram of Study: Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.\nFinancial Aid and Student Account: Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs. International Students: Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.\n\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 12\n\n\n4 MLT Degree Attainment\n4.1 Course Requirements\nIn order to complete the Master of Language Technologies degree, the student must pass 120 or more course units of senior-to-graduate courses, and meet the following criteria:\nwithin those 120 units, at least 72 units of \u201cLTI\u201d courses and 24 units of \u201cSCS\u201d courses, \u2022 within those 72 units, 11-711, 11-791 (or an equivalent, see below), and one ``Task Orientation Focus'' class, and\nwithin those 72 units, at least one of the following: o an LTI lab course, o 11-792, or o project-oriented Masters\u2019 thesis;\nOf the remaining 24 units, 12 must be 11-910 Directed Research; \u2022 The final 12 units are an Open Elective.\nThe student must also complete two summers of full-time directed research, attend the LTI Colloquium (11-700) each semester, and satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement described elsewhere.\nSince 11-791 is not being offered currently, the faculty have defined a list of acceptable substitute courses:\n11-727: Computational Semantics for NLP (only if the course project was done as a group project)\n11-731: Machine Translation \u2022 11-747: Neural Networks for NLP \u2022 11-751: Speech Recognition \u2022 11-775: Large-Scale Multimedia \u2022 11-776: Multimodal Affective Computing \u2022 11-777: Multimodal Machine Learning \u2022 11-785: Deep Learning \u2022 11-797: Question Answering\nStudents may request to have other LTI courses with a group engineering project component to be added to this list.\nFor definitions of quoted terms, see the section on \u201cDefinitions of LTI Terminology.\u201d\nUnless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 13\n\n\nNote that a Masters\u2019 Thesis is not required in general, although a thesis project may be used to satisfy the \u201clab\u201d requirement.\n4.1.1 Grade Requirements\nStudents must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed study by satisfying the following grade requirements:\n1. Minimum grade: Only courses with a grade of C (2.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree requirement.\n2. Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement.\n4.1.2 Research Speaking Requirement\nTo emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills, and increase internal awareness of LTI work, all MLT students must complete an oral presentation in their second year (by the end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20-minute talk plus time for discussion. It must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the public will be invited.\nAt least two CMU faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor. After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the chair of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery.\n4.1.3 Withdrawal of a Degree\nThe University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html.\n4.2 Advising\nEach student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed study projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 14\n\n\nHow and when the advisor is selected: the Marriage Process: Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (\u201cImmigration Course,\u201d or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a first, second, and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take, and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a \u201cMarriage Committee\u201d to determine the best set of matches.\nSome entering MLT students are prefunded, meaning they have received and accepted a funding letter from a faculty member before the Marriage Process. (Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI\u2019s research projects.) Even self-supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty advisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate programs serves as the advisor.\nHow to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem (assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time.\n4.3 Optional Masters\u2019 Thesis\nMLT students may optionally elect to complete a Masters\u2019 Thesis; it is not required. Students who intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several ways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in a research project or class project work.\nThe MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the October 31 proposal deadline!\nThere are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. Thesis: 11-928 \u2013 Masters\u2019 Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units, typically in the Fall of their second year) and 11-929 \u2013 Masters\u2019 Thesis II in the following Spring.\nEach of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT-level LTI course credit; if the student goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11-929) counts towards one PhD lab requirement.\nThe MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their advisor to define an interesting but bounded thesis research project. The MLT thesis culminates in\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 15\n\n\na publication-quality paper that clearly describes the work in terms of its research significance.\nThe MLT thesis committee will be composed of a thesis advisor and two additional readers, to be chosen by the student in consultation with the advisor, during the Fall Masters\u2019 Thesis I course. At least 2 of the 3 committee members must be SCS faculty working in Language Technologies.\nTo receive a final grade for the first semester's course, the student must have prepared\na written proposal of at least five pages, describing the scientific thesis to be investigated, any relevant research already completed by the student, a comparison with related work by others, and a detailed description of the work to be done in the next semester. The proposal MUST be accepted by the committee by the end of October, or the student will not be allowed to enroll in 11-929 \u2013 Masters\u2019 Thesis II! \u2022 Sometime during the semester when the student enrolls in 11-929 \u2013 Masters\u2019 Thesis II (typically, their final semester), the student will distribute a draft of the thesis to the committee for initial review. This should be done as early as feasible, to avoid last- minute surprises that could delay final approval of the thesis.\nThe thesis work culminates in submission of the final version of the thesis document, followed by a public presentation of the work in an LTI seminar (or other suitable public forum). Since the defense is public, the LTI graduate program administrator must receive all the information required for a public announcement at least one week before the defense. The Masters\u2019 Thesis presentation is somewhat less rigorous than a PhD thesis defense. The presentation must communicate the research work done, similar to a conference paper presentation. The committee will observe the presentation, and then decide whether the thesis and presentation were acceptable, or whether further work is required. Unlike a PhD defense, only a simple majority vote of the committee is required for approval.\nAlthough students are required to enroll in the appropriate course sequence of two Masters\u2019 Thesis courses, it is not required that students finish the thesis by the end of that second semester. If a student requires more time to revise the thesis to the committee's satisfaction, and adequately present the work, an incomplete grade will be assessed in the Masters\u2019 Thesis course, until such time as the work and presentation are accepted. The student will still be allowed to walk in Spring Commencement, if all other requirements for the MLT degree have been completed. Students should note that any financial support beyond the end of the semester will be on a case-by-case basis, and must be arranged in advance with the project supporting them. Students are strongly encouraged to finish the thesis work within one (1) year following the semester they enroll for the first Masters\u2019 Thesis course.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 16\n\n\n4.4 Definitions of LTI Terminology\nWe define here some of the terms as used in this handbook:\nAn \u201cLTI course\u201d is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with an 11-XXX counts as 1/2 of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that we will allow any one MLD (10-xxx) graduate-level course to count as an \u201cLTI course.\u201d\nAn \u201cSCS course\u201d is any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6-unit course with such a number counts as 1/2 of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended electives that are technically outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Digital Signal Processing in ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as \u201cSCS.\u201d\n\u201cLTI Focus Areas\u201d are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under \u201cCourse Categories.\u201d If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should notify the Chair of the LTI Graduate Programs. He will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area, and if approved it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage. Area, as listed on the \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage.\nAn LTI \u201clab course\u201d is simply a course in the list of lab courses defined in the LTI \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage.\n4.5 Recommended Electives outside of SCS\nStudents are free to take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross- registered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requirements of their program as described above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor; typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses.\nNote: recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the \u201cSCS\u201d course requirement. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as \u201cSCS.\u201d\nNote also that students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., summer courses). The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (\u201cB-\u201d is the minimum for PhD, \u201cC\u201d for MLT).\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 17\n\n\n4.6 LTI Orientation\nAt the beginning of each Fall semester, the LTI provides a set of lectures and talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and treat them seriously, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however, the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.\nFor many years, these talks were called \"the Immigration Course (IC)\", which caused confusion. The older name has been retired; however, people who have been at CMU a long time may occasionally use the older name.\n4.7 End of Semester Evaluation\nNear the end of the spring and fall semesters, the student must prepare a statement that describes their achievements in the current semester, and plans for the next semester. At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degree.\nA good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual.\nIf a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \u201cblack mark\u201d on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.\nIn the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.\n4.8 Enrollment Verification\nEnrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at: http://www.cmu.edu/hub/transcripts/verifications/enrollment.html.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 18\n\n\n4.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading\n4.9.1 University Policy on Grades\nww.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.\n4.9.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses\nwww.cmu.edu/policies/documents/TransferCredit.html Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors, or QPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department's policies allow this.)\n4.10 Academic Integrity\nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity:\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html\nThe policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.\nA review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeals process.\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html\nIn the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 19\n\n\nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society; to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem- solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.\nIn any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.\nThe university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process. Please see https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/ for more information.\nImportant note: The LTI implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.\u201d Our procedure is as follows: a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide not to immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation. If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.\n5 Academic Policies\n5.1 MLT Academic Policies\n5.1.1 Duration of Study\nMLT students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in two calendar years (24 months). This includes two summers of full-time directed research.\nSee also the \u201cStatute of Limitations\u201d policy.\n5.1.2 Double-Dipping\nA Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 20\n\n\ntoward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. This is an SCS-wide policy.\n5.1.3 Pass/Fail Grades\nPass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.\n5.1.4 Independent Study\nFor an Independent Study to satisfy an MLT student\u2019s coursework requirements, it must be approved by the MLT Program Director in advance. In consultation with the CMU faculty member who will be supervising the Independent Study, the student should produce a short (half-page to one page) description of the goals of the Independent Study, and how the results will be evaluated, and submit it to the Program Director before the end of the Add period of the semester of the proposed study. The study should be planned so that it is finished in time for the supervising faculty member to give a grade at the end of the semester. Independent studies may be undertaken f"}
