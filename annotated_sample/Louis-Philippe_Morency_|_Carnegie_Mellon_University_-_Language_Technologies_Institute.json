Human face-to-face communication is a little like a dance: participants continuously adjust their behaviors based on their interlocutor\u2019s speech, gestures and facial expressions during social interaction. The actual sophistication of human communication comes to the fore when we try to create computers that can understand and participate, however crudely, in this type of social interaction.\n\nMultimodal Machine Learning\n\nMultimodal Machine Learning\n\nHealth Behavior Informatics\n\nHealth Behavior Informatics\n\nContact Us Language Technologies Institute\n\n5000 Forbes Avenue\n\nPittsburgh, PA\n\n15213-3891\n\n412-268-6591\n\nltiwebmaster@cs.cmu.edu\n\nConnect\n\nLogin |\n\nLogout"}
