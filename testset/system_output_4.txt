TAP stands for 'The Assumption of Risk, Assessment, and Preparation' in the context of this paper.  TAP was a three-part program designed to help students develop skills in leadership, problem-solving, and communication. The program was offered through the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) and the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs.  The first part of the TAP program was an assumption of risk. This meant that if a student were to become pregnant, they would receive support from the university, including academic accommodations.  The second part of the program was an assessment, to determine the level of support needed. This was done in order to

0.3%  This study aims to build a decoder-only architecture for ASR tasks and enhance its performance with text augmentation using external text-only data. We propose using a decoder-only model, which is the same as an autoregressive LM, to provide audio information as prompts compressed by CTC prediction. Although the proposed model achieved a slightly degraded ST model compared with conventional encoder– decoder models, it outperformed them on the LibriSpeech 100h and Switchboard training scenarios.  We experimentally show that our proposed approach achieves lower word error rates (WERs) by 0.3% and

The method uses the YourTTS model and involves a novel multi-accent training mechanism.  The method works by decomposing each weight into two or more parts, each part corresponding to a different accent. This allows the model to learn how to weight each part differently, depending on the desired output.  The method also factorizes the weight into a shared component and an accent-dependent component. The shared component is initialized with the pretrained multi-speaker TTS model, while the accent-dependent component is factorized into vectors using rank-1 matrices.  Overall, the method improves the performance of the TTS model by combining different accents in the output.  int

The Plan module transfers a task description into a list of high-level sub-tasks.  The Eliminate module masks out relevant objects and receptacles from the observation for the current sub-task.  The Track module determines if the current sub-task has been accomplished.  All of these modules work together to make the PET framework more effective and efficient.  For example, if the task is to build a robot that can make a variety of dish, the PET framework would first generate a list of potential sub-tasks such as sourcing, cooking, and serving. It would then determine which sub-tasks are relevant and important for the task at hand.
The term for the discrepancies between increases in computational throughput and reductions in floating point operations is the \\textit{framework tax}.  In this work, we examine this phenomenon through a series of case studies. We investigate the effects of changes in hardware speed, model size, and model complexity on the framework tax and demonstrate that the disparity is growing as hardware speed increases over time. Our findings indicate that the design of deep learning frameworks can have a greater impact on overall framework performance as hardware speed increases. This highlights the importance of framework design to minimize bottlenecks and reduce the framework tax to ensure optimal use of hardware resources.  The framework tax, as we define it, is the difference

The attention dot-product scores.  The attention dot-product scores are used as a measure of how similar two tokens are.  In Unlimiformer, the top-k attention keys cover more than 99% of the attention mass, and thus attending only to the top-k keys is an accurate approximation of the full, exact, attention.  The Unlimiformer index can be kept on either the GPU or CPU memory, needs to hold only a single vector per input token, and can be queried in sub-linear time.  It can be used to index practically unlimited input sequences, while every attention head in every decoder layer retrieves its top-k keys,

It also mentions that InPars-light uses 7x-100x smaller ranking models and only a freely available language model BLOOM. This is how the model was able to outperform InPars.  The text also states that these good results were achieved by re-ranking only 100 candidate documents compared to 1000 used in InPars. This shows that InPars-light is more efficient than InP

0.3% and 1.4%  This is because the decoder-only model was trained with CTC prompts, which improved its performance on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other compared to the baseline.  The proposed model had an advantage in computational efficiency compared with conventional encoder–decoder ASR models with a similar setup.  We used a decoder-only architecture for ASR with simple text augmentation. To provide audio information, encoder features compressed by CTC prediction were used as prompts for the decoder, which can be regarded as refining CTC prediction using the decoder-only model.

The accuracy using SHAP reduction is 16 out of 19.  This is because the model is using the features that it extracts, which are the most relevant ones for the task at hand.  The accuracy is also high because the model is using a simple but effective feature extraction method, which is the SVD.  The SVD is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that is used to extract the most relevant features from the data.  The SVD is also a lossless compression technique that can be used to reduce the size of the dataset while retaining the information that is relevant for the task at hand.  The SVD is a very effective tool for data compression and feature extra

The novel framework introduced for learning unified multi-sensory object property representations is called MOSAIC.  The name MOSAIC is an acronym that stands for Learning Multimodal Object properties with Self-Attention and Interactive Comprehension.  MOSAIC is designed to extract unified multi-sensory object property representations, enabling understanding of object properties by leveraging diverse sensory modalities.  This approach rests on the premise that natural language provides a versatile embedding space whose 2D or 3D coordinates can be used to describe the diverse properties of objects.  MOSAIC is a new framework that allows for the interactive perception
African languages  The study suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.  Learning from naturally occurring language data is the key to language learning and development. However, it is not always easy to access or create language data that is both naturally occurring and language-specific. One potential solution to this problem is to create language data by modeling natural language generation using machine learning. This approach has the advantage of being relatively inexpensive and quick to produce. The model can be trained on a large enough data set of naturally occurring text, and it can be prompted with a specific language to generate text in that language.  In this study,

Learning from Human Feedback  by Zhiqing Sun, Jing Yu, Zhiheng Zhang, Zhenfang Zhou  in this task, we use a simple but effective text rewriting strategy: We first find the most frequent 1000 dimensional vector from the T5-based text augmented LM, and then use this vector as the text prompt for FLARE. As shown in Figure 2, this strategy is not only effective on the training set, but also on the blind test set, as we will show in Section 4. This strategy has an additional advantage of in- hibiting the retrieval of documents that are not in the training set,
MOSAIC leverages the pre-trained text encoder from CLIP.  MOSAIC uses a distillation technique to incorporate the knowledge from the pre-trained text encoder in CLIP. This allows the model to learn multimodal representations through unsupervised learning.  The text encoder in MOSAIC is a pre-trained model that has already been trained on a large dataset of text. During training, the model is distilled to incorporate the knowledge from this pre-trained model.  MOSAIC's pre-training data is a set of 100 objects. The model uses 10 exploratory behaviors

The benefits include increased efficiency and performance.  Existing retrieval augmented LMs often generate unnecessary or inappropriate retrieval queries, which can disrupt answer generation and negatively impact performance. FLARE addresses this issue by prompting LMs to generate retrieval queries only when necessary, ensuring that the search process is more efficient and effective.  FLARE also improves performance by combining retrieval and downstream task-related skills. This approach allows LMs to utilize their full potential by combining their skills in a complementary way.  Overall, FLARE offers a more effective and efficient solution for search and generation tasks compared to existing methods.  I hope this helps

The MQTTS system with a code size of 1024 achieves a MOS-Q of 3.9.  Archive  The Pipeline System The Pipeline System is a multi-step framework for text to speech (TTS) systems. This framework is an upgrade from the Multi- step TTS (MSTTS) which has a single step for synthesis. The MSTTS has a single model for the entire pipeline, which is inefficient but can be problematic if there are many revisions. In the Pipeline System, we have multiple models for different steps of the pipeline. This has the benefit of increased efficiency since we only have to train one model for each step

The loss functions proposed in the Fairness Continual Learning approach are zero-sum loss and non-zero-sum loss.  For the zero-sum loss, we have: L = (cid:80) r,s(j) where r is the loss of one participant and s(j) is the loss of the other participant.  For the non-zero-sum loss, we have: L = (cid:80) r, ε(j) where ε(j) is the loss of the other participant.  L(·) is the best-case performance on a task, given a set of N possible outcomes (cid:80)
The OUTDOOR task proposed in this work is a new task that allows LLMs to accurately hallucinate possible futures in outdoor environments.

The BigCode project is an open-scientific collaboration working on the responsible development of large language models for code.  This tech report describes the progress of the collaboration until December 2022, outlining the current state of the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) redaction pipeline, the experiments conducted to de-risk the model architecture, and the experiments investigating better preprocessing methods for the training data. We train 1.1B parameter models on multi-GPUs for 2-4 hours per run. We find that in-context learning can reduce the training time of models by 6-8 hours. We also find that in-context learning can reduce the time

0.517  The Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient is a measure of the degree of non-linearity in the data. A higher value indicates a stronger non-linear relationship.  B.1 Human Preference   We show this in Figure 7. For the languages that we have a large enough dataset to show a good correlation (i.e., Rust, Python, JavaScript, and Java), we find that the language-specific BERTScore is able to distinguish between good and bad responses (see Figure 7, left), as well as between different models (see Figure 7, right). This is in contrast to the across-language BERTScore (Figure

Hedges can be generated using a variety of methods, including machine learning and rule-based classification. The model can also use different types of hedges, such as direct hedges, entailment hedges, and correction hedges.  The model is capable of learning how to use different types of hedges in a conversation, depending on the context and other factors. This allows it to adapt its language to different situations and people.  The model is also capable of spontaneously generating new hedges, as it learns from real human dialogues. This is an important aspect of language generation, as it allows the model to adapt to new and changing circumstances.  The results

TASTE verbalizes the items in user-item interactions (Eq. 2) and makes the text utterance 𝑋 (H ) longer, which challenges the long text processing ability of pretrained language models due to the max length of attention sparsity.  TASTE has the ability to reduce the GPU memory and achieve more than 2% improvements by modeling longer user-item interaction history.  Instead of using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict the user’s next interaction, we propose a new architecture to improve the modeling of longer user-item interactions, by modeling the text sequences as an interconnection of multiple RNN

The paper investigated the use of a single unified method for handling the mixture of various imprecise labels.  The weak semantics in these semi-structured information resources can support interesting applications, such as automated reasoning and inference, and knowledge re-use and combination. We are exploring how to build a probabilistic knowledge representation language, with an associated inference system, that can be used to analyze, decipher, and utilize the meaning of information in these semi-structured resources.  Advances in core NLP technology: Human language is complex and nuanced, and handling this complexity in a computational way requires sophisticated algorithms or learning techniques, the development of which is far from a solved

It was in the field of Computer Science.  The first doctorate at Carnegie Tech was awarded in 1919.  The field of Computer Science was still in its infancy when Carnegie Tech awarded its first doctorate. The university’s first computer, an IBM 650 with magnetic-drum memory and a speed of about 60 instructions per second, had arrived on campus just two years prior.  Yet, with an $11,000 grant from the R.K. Mellon Foundation, Carnegie Tech established its Computer Science Department in 1965. Perlis was the first department head. There were no

Social acceptability and hate speech detection  Pearson’s r  Talat et al., 2022; Sap et al., 2022; Ghosh et al., 2021. We examine datasets and supervised models for these tasks as well as general-purpose large language models (i.e., GPT-4).  This may be due to a lack of sensitivity of the OA metrics in the presence of low-confidence annotations. In the future, it may be more effective to consider a spectrum of metrics, including the OA metrics, in addition to the current focus on F1 scores. 7 Conclusion and Future Work

In the paper, the authors used a retrieval-based approach (kNN-MT) for inference-time adaptation, which demonstrated an improvement of +0.8 BLEU for speech translation.  The authors also used adapters to easily integrate incremental training data from data augmentation, which matches the performance of re-training.  The authors observed that cascaded speech translation systems are more easily adaptable towards specific target domains, due to their separate models.  The authors used a system that used our machine translation model for knowledge distillation. They also ensemble models trained with and without synthesized speech data.  The authors observed that their system had an improvement of +0.8 B
Fusion-in-T5 (FiT5)  The input to FiT5 is formulated using a template that incorporates the document text with the ranking feature.

The results of passage ranking on MS MARCO and TREC DL are presented in Table 1. By incorporating multiple types of ranking information, FiT5 greatly improves over the first-stage retrieval model coCondensor, and outperforms typical BERT Re-ranker and monoT5 that re-rank on top of the same retr

In the Paaploss paper, the proposed method showed improvement in speech enhancement.  Context:  Despite rapid advancement in recent years, current speech enhancement models often produce speech that differs in perceptual quality from real clean speech. We propose a novel auxiliary objective for speech enhancement, the phonetic-aligned acoustic parameter (PAAP) loss, which minimizes the differences between important temporal acoustic parameters that are weighted by phoneme types. We ﬁne-tune competitive speech enhancement models with the addition of PAAP Loss, and experiments show that performance increases across all evaluation metrics, including  WER from competitive ASR and SL

The OUTDOOR task is designed to help LLMs accurately navigate in outdoor environments by leveraging unseen information.  Context:  The task is to find a way to a specific place (the goal) using a robot (the agent), bypassing any barriers (e.g., fences, gates, doors) while avoiding dangers (e.g., other robots, sharp objects, deep water). The task is often set up as a race against other robots, with the fastest robot winning. The task is difficult because the robot does not have a map of the environment, and it does not have a pre-determined set of actions it can take at each step

10%  This is because the model is only trained on a small amount of data, which may not be representative of the broader population. To address this issue, we propose a method to increase the amount of data that is representative of the broad- er community, by combining LLMs in a debiasing technique. Our approach is effective in reducing the bias towards the majority vote in LLMs, which has significant implica- tions in the research community. We demonstrate that our technique is effective in both Arabic and English, and can be applied to models pretrained on both Arabic and English data. Our findings show that there is a high level of consensus in the responses of the LLM

SenteCon is a text-to-speech system that takes a given text as input and outputs a corresponding speech signal.  In Figure 3, we show some example ASR errors from dev using SCLITE. The corrections are highlighted in bold and italic, indicating that these are the ones that were not predicted correctly by the ASR model.  For ASR, the distribution of text segment lengths is skewed, with a mean of 13.4 words. The text is also longer than the speech duration, with an average of 43.5 words.  After correcting for potential errors, we find that 93% of words were correctly transcribed by the AS

KALE terms were able to complement already strong learned sparse representations, providing accuracy boosts at relatively small efficiency costs.  The generated vocabulary was able to capture semantic information in the corpus that existing sparse representations did not capture as accurately or did not capture at all.  The KALE terms can be used to replace the original lexical vocabulary, with gains in accuracy and efficiency. Combining KALE with the original lexical vocabulary, or with other learned terms, can further improve retrieval accuracy with only a modest increase in computational cost.  Overall, KALE terms were able to complement already strong learned sparse representations, providing accuracy boosts

The term 'SHAP' stands for 'Shapley Explanation by Averaging Pairwise Human-chat Assessment'. It is used in this context as a method for measuring how words contribute to the perception of regard or disregard in a sentence.  In the context of the text, the method is used to analyze the contributions of different words to the overall perception of regard or disregard in a sentence. The results show that some words, like 'great', 'try', and 'hope', have a positive effect on the perception of regard, while others, like 'idiot', 'lame', and 'dumb', have a negative effect.  The

Although there is a lot of literature on the topic, there is limited research on how to effectively integrate a large number of multiple languages.  One approach mentioned in the text is to use a retriever-reader combination. This has been done in prior works, such as DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020), which has demonstrated success with English. However, there is limited research on how to effectively integrate a large number of multiple languages.  To address this challenge, one approach is to develop multilingual dialogue systems that can process multiple languages in a structured way. For example, a system that can process Finnish, English, and Spanish could be developed with a shared enc

CSurF uses vector term representations to address semantic mismatch in exact-match retrieval.  5.2 Retrieval Cost and Effectiveness-Efficiency Tradeoff In this section, we evaluate the retrieval cost and effectiveness-efficiency tradeoff of CSurF. For this, we measure the time and GPU hours required to train a 1B parameter model. We evaluate the performance of CSurF on a Nvidia Titan RTX GPU with 24GB memory. The training time of CSurF is directly proportional to the size of the lexical vocabulary. For a 1B parameter model, the train- ing time of CSurF is 19.6 hours

The tldr of the paper is a study on multimodal language analysis in the wild.  The authors propose a new method for multimodal language analysis, which they call Fusion-in-T5. This method uses a Transformer-based architecture with a novel fusion module to combine text, image, and audio features. The system is trained on a large dataset of multimodal annotations, and is capable of generating language-specific scores for each of the three modalities.  The authors evaluate their system on a number of tasks, including image retrieval, text classification, and audio emotion recognition.

The two proposed subtasks for the DSTC11 automatic evaluation track are DER-based evaluation and SA-WER.  The DER-based evaluation is used to determine the optimal speaker assignments, which are then used to compute the final ranking metric, SA-WER.  Both subtasks aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics for various speech recognition tasks in different languages.  The DER-based evaluation and SA-WER are used to assess the performance of the proposed metrics on a multilingual scale.  The proposed metrics are being evaluated on multiple dimensions, including language and task type.  The task type includes speech translation, speech transcription, and speech

The proposed framework is ORCA, which extends the applicability of a single pretrained model to multiple modalities.  Pretrained models can be applied to multiple modalities with the proposed cross-modal fine-tuning framework, ORCA.  This approach has the potential to significantly reduce the time and cost required for developing models for each new modality while maintaining comparable performance.  The framework is designed to be highly adaptable, enabling the use of pretrained models in a wide range of modalities with only a few additional components.  The proposed framework offers several advantages, including quicker development and deployment of models in multiple modalities.  The time and cost required for developing models

The proposed forward-backward algorithm is an efficient algorithm that can be used to model vocal fold dynamics.  In this paper, we propose a novel analysis-by-synthesis approach that allows us to infer the VFOs directly from recorded speech signals on an individualized, speaker-by-speaker basis.  The proposed methodology is based on the phase space characterization of the physical process of phonation. We build a phase space model of the process and use a nonlinear mapping to convert the phase space into a higher-dimensional space. The resulting higher-dimensional model is then divided into a set of lower-dimensional sub-model, which are used to analyze the phase space features of interest.

One limitation of existing retrieval-augmented LMs is that they tend to generate fewer search queries than necessary.  Motivated by the observation that LMs tend to be too short and lack diversity (Kang et al., 2021), we propose FLARE, a framework that actively retrieves information from a large datastore to augment LMs. We introduce a new prompt, FLAREinstruct, to improve the generation of meaningful search queries and increase the diversity of LM outputs. Our experiments show that FLAREinstruct improves performance by 20% while retrieving only 0.2% of the datastore. We

The proposed model in the text maps the output of a text-only LLM to the embedding space of an off-the-shelf text-to-image generation model, enabling us to leverage the strong text representations of the LLM for visual outputs.  The proposed model is capable of processing interleaved image-and-text inputs to generate text, retrieve images, and generate novel images.  In this work, we propose an efficient mapping network to ground the LLM to an off-the-shelf text-to-image generation model. This mapping network translates hidden representations of text into the embedding space of the visual models, enabling us to leverage the strong text representations of the LLM

Modeling the conversation with entity graphs provides additional information that improves the retrieval of answer passages for the current question.  Experiments show that using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs improves top precision answer passage ranking.  The proposed method is a neural ranking model with a graphical architecture. It uses a TDT model to predict the centrality of each entity in the conversation entity graph, which is a key component of the model.  The results show that the proposed method outperforms competitive baseline methods on all three tasks. In addition, we find that on all tasks, the TDT model achieves better performance than the LLM in all three tasks, especially on

2.3  In this work, we propose a multi-modal 3D facial shape and image quantizer. To improve the robustness to the unseen acquisition angles, we adopt a 3D facial shape quantizer in our system. We utilize the facial shape to predict the image quantizer to aggregate the image information. This has demonstrated robust performance on unseen acquisition angles. We also propose a novel image quantizer to aggregate the image information. This is a 3D convolutional network (C3D) for image classification. This C3D is designed to take advantage of the 1:1 pixel to voxel mapping in 3D space. The 3D

[/INST] The DAE achieved by the CRL-COM (D) system from the paper is 14.1.  This is equivalent to a BLEU score of 19.5.  BLEU is a measure of the number of subword units in an input text that have been reused by a translation model. In other words, it measures the level of vocabulary coverage achieved by the translation. The higher the BLEU score, the better the translation.  In this context, a BLEU score of 19.5 indicates that the model has achieved a high level of vocabulary coverage, with most subword units in the input

KALE uses a small model with a k-sparse projector to convert dense representations into a sparse set of entries from a latent vocabulary.  The KALE vocabulary captures semantic concepts that perform well when used in isolation, and perform better when extending the original lexical vocabulary. This way, KALE improves first-stage retrieval accuracy.  Experiments with the MSMARCOv1 passage retrieval dataset, the TREC Deep Learning dataset, and BEIR, a new dataset of Arabic text, show that KALE is a generic method that can effectively retrieve any information that is already in the training data.

Translation quality was evaluated with BLEU score.  BLEU score is a measure of translation quality that assesses the fluency and naturalness of the translation.  BLEU score is calculated by comparing the machine-generated translation with the gold-standard translation using a BLEU metric.  The BLEU score is a percentage of the words in the translation that are correct and similar to the original text.  A higher BLEU score indicates a better translation quality.  In this study, the BLEU score for the translation system is not specified.  There is a need for further research on this topic to improve the translation quality and address the language barrier.

This paper provides the first analysis of the training data of a diffusion model, by showing that the data memorizes the training examples, and that this memorization is not an isolated phenomenon, but is a general feature of diffusion models. We show that this memorization can be used to launch effective membership inference attacks on the model. Our results demonstrate the importance of data hygiene in the context of diffusion models.

Latency, throughput, memory overhead, and energy consumption.  The metrics adopted in Pentathlon aim to evaluate different aspects of efficiency, such as latency, throughput (or speed), memory overhead, and energy consumption.  Latency is an important metric in Pentathlon as it directly affects the user experience. This is also reflected in the evaluation methodology.  Throughput (or speed) is another important efficiency metric that is evaluated in Pentathlon. This measures how fast a system can complete tasks.  Energy consumption is also a key focus area in Pentathlon, as this helps evaluate the environmental impact of efficient models.  All these metrics are included

BASS considers block-wise modeling, which allows it to process a portion of the input frames at a time.  Context:  In this paper, we address the challenge of training end-to-end speech summarization models over very long inputs. Though certain optimizations can be used to improve the upper limit on input size for summarization models, performance is lim- ited by the truncation of model inputs during training and infer- ence. We propose Block-wise Adaptive for Speech Sequences (BASS) to address this challenge - an algorithm that consumes the input in blocks and passes semantic context across blocks to  24 25 26 27
Statistical learning.  The concept of learning language through repeated exposure to referents is a popular model within the psychology community.  Yu & Ballard (2007) incorporated a social element into models by considering “social-cognitive” capacities, such as attention reading, that act as a form of ToM.  Yu (2008) furthered this work by introducing the idea of multiple hypothesis in language learning. This model is also capable of learning through social interaction.  Zhu et al. (2022) developed an image referential game where the speaker and listener are capable of learning language through ToM and using this knowledge to

The proposed approach in the paper 'Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View' is aimed at modeling the voice-face correlation from a geometry perspective, without any semantic information.  The paper proposes a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, equipped with a phonatory module that enables the analysis of the voice-face correlation. The proposed method has the ability to reconstruct the 3D facial shape from voice.  The main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  1. A large-scale dataset is collected, including 3D face scans and voice recordings.  2. A voice-AM

The three unseen tasks investigated in the paper are audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR), code-switched speech recognition (CS-ASR), and speech translation (ST).  The AVSR task is about recognizing speech audio.  The CS-ASR task is about recognizing speech in code-switched speech.  The ST task is about translating speech in an unseen language.  All three tasks use different prompts, either by leveraging another large-scale model or simply manipulating the special tokens in the default prompts.  Experiments show that compared to the default prompts, the task-specific prompts improve performance significantly.  The results demonstrate that

Reciprocal rank is used to measure the effectiveness of a ranking system for users interested in exactly one relevant item.  The lack of sensitivity of reciprocal rank is compounded in modern evaluation settings where current, high-precision systems may be difficult to distinguish.  5.1 Correlation with Reciprocal Rank  One of the limitations of reciprocal rank as a sensitivity metric is that it is not able to distinguish systems that are only slightly different from the best system. This is often the case for systems that have a large number of relevant items. For example, if a system has 100 relevant items and a second system has 101 relevant items, it is

A.1 Additional Analyses of Optimizations  In this paper, we present CodeBERTScore, a simple evaluation metric for code generation, which builds on BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020), using pretrained language models of code, and leveraging the natural language context of the generated code. We perform an extensive evaluation across four programming languages which shows that CodeBERTScore is more correlated with human preference than all prior metrics. Further, we show that generated code that receives a higher score by CodeBERTScore is less buggy, as well. Our findings demonstrate the potential of using pretrained

The two innovative designs of StyleRF are:  1. In-memory search index: This feature allows for lightning-fast search by pre-indexing the entire dataset in memory, enabling quick and efficient results.  2. Distributed architecture: This design choice allows for more efficient data processing by dividing the large dataset into smaller chunks and processing them in parallel across multiple devices or computers.  These two features contribute to the overall speed and efficiency of the StyleRF system.  What is the purpose of the 'Apply' button on the website?

Pengi uses a frozen text encoder gψ and a learnable mapping m2 to represent the text input.  The unified architecture in Figure 2 takes as input, an audio recording and a text prompt. It uses a pre-trained frozen autoregressive language model as the audio encoder aϕ.  Pengi has a unified architecture that can be used for both close-ended and open-ended tasks.  The hypothesis is that learning a shared audio encoder and mapping networks helps Pengi to solve individual tasks better.  A study on the effectiveness of Pengi for various tasks is presented in Table 4.  A comparison of performance on
The real-world applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated in the work [5, 46] where it is applied to a shopping platform.

Unlimiformer offloads the cross-attention computation to a kNN index.  Context: Given a long input sequence, Unlimiformer constructs a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index over the hidden states of all input tokens. Then, every standard cross-attention head in every decoder layer queries the kNN index, such that the kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores, and attends only to the top-k input tokens. In preliminary experiments with the BART decoder, we found that a k of 256 or 128 works well. The k is a hyper-parameter and can be tuned for each

The novel architecture introduced in the paper is a Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) that extends conventional RNN-Transducer architectures by jointly predicting both a token and its duration.  The TDT architecture uses a joint network with two sub-networks, each predicting a probability distribution over the token and duration, respectively. The joint network is trained to maximize the log-likelihood of the correct token and duration given the input sequence.  The TDT architecture has several advantages over previous RNN-Transducer models. Firstly, it reduces the computational complexity by only predicting a single duration for each token. Secondly, it allows for more efficient training by sharing weights
The usage of a highly-weighted ToM listener leads to significant fluency gains when training on both easy and hard distractors.  Context: We also ﬁnd that the usage of a highly-weighted ToM listener leads to signiﬁcant ﬂuency gains when training on both easy (15.6% relative increase in ﬂuency score) and hard (11.6%) distractors. We also see longer and more complex utterances when using normally or highly weighted ToM listeners.  We also ﬁnd that the inclusion of a ToM listener in the training process improves the per- formance of all models
