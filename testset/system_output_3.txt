The paper suggests that attacking multimodal models that allow users to provide images can be done by using adversarial perturbations of the input image. The authors find that they can use continuous-domain images as adversarial prompts to cause the language model to emit harmful or toxic content. They conjecture that improved NLP attacks may be able to trigger similar adversarial behavior on alignment-trained text-only models, and call on researchers to explore this understudied problem. The paper also notes that future models may add additional modalities (e.g. audio) which can introduce new vulnerabilities and surfaces for attack.  In summary, the answer is that attacking multimodal models that allow

Approximate kNN search: kNN-LM uses an approximate kNN search algorithm, which can reduce the computational complexity of the search process. 3. Importance of softmax temperature for the kNN distribution: kNN-LM uses a different temperature parameter in the softmax function, which can affect the distribution of the kNN component and lead to better performance.

CSurF addresses sparse lexicon-based retrieval by simultaneously expanding surface forms and assigning contextualized representations to each surface form, which helps to address the vocabulary and semantic mismatch issues in exact-match retrieval. This is achieved through the use of vector term representations and context source grounding, which enables CSurF to jointly expand meaningful surface forms and ground them in context. Additionally, CSurF's ability to perform surface form expansion and assign contextualized representations to each surface form allows it to achieve state-of-the-art retrieval performance for lexical exact-match systems, while also providing a more efficient and effective retrieval framework compared to current lexicon-based retrieval models

SenteCon can negatively impact predictive performance on downstream tasks by constraining the model to only apply optimization techniques present in the prompt, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Using a smaller batch size or sequence length for fine-tuning can also negate the throughput benefits from compression due to the smaller communication cost. Additionally, the poor inference alignment in the model can contribute to poor performance, including a high P-FID score due to the presence of long segments of non-speech in the syntheses. Applying the duration predictor can resolve the alignment issue and significantly improve performance, but there is still a sizable gap with other systems. Finally, using single attention on Transformer TTS can lead to

Memorization: Diffusion models memorize and regenerate individual training images, allowing adversaries to launch training data extraction attacks. 2. Data extraction: Diffusion models can be used to extract training data, which can be used to compromise the privacy of the training set. 3.
