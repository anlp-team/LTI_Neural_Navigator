However, some students may wish to be a teaching assistant. MCDS students may petition for approval to TA up to one course per semester provided that they are in good academic standing (Overall QPA 3.0 or above).\nAs required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990, graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns.\nThe full university policy can be reviewed at:\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency- instructors.html.\nIn addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (mandatory screening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/\n3.3.28 Internship Requirement and Search for Full Time Employment\nAn internship is required for the degree program. In some cases, when a student has prior work experience, the Director of the degree program may waive this requirement. Students start searching for internships generally in the Fall and Spring semesters. Once the student returns from an internship in the Fall, they should immediately begin the search resources are available at http://www.cmu.edu/career/ including a resume submission system, a list of employers, on campus interviews and mock interviews, and many other resources.\nfor\nfull\ntime employment. Extensive\nThe (TOC) http://engineering.cmu.edu/companies/toc/ occurs every September. This conference is one of the main recruiting events each year.\nTechnical\nOpportunities\nConference\nAll international students are required to apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT). CPT is employment that is an integral part of an established curriculum and is directly related to the student\u2019s major area of study. Please visit the Office of International Education the CPT process: http://www.cmu.edu/oie/forstu/jobs.html\n(OIE)\nlink below\nto\nlearn more\nabout\n23\n\n\n3.4 Enrollment Verification Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB via this link: http://www.cmu.edu/hub/transcripts/verifications/enrollment.html\n3.5 University Policies on Grades and Grading\n3.6.1 University Policy on Grades\nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.\nYou can review the university grading policies here: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html\n3.6.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses\nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university\u2019s cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department\u2019s policies allow this.)\nYou can review the university policy here: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html\n3.6 Academic Integrity\n3.7.1 Expectations Regarding Proper Conduct\nIn the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports\n24\n\n\ndiscussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.\nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.\nIn any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.\nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html). The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.\nA review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html) is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.\n3.7.2 Protocol for Academic Integrity Violations\nThe university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures and the appeal process for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged academic integrity violation.\nFor more information on disciplinary actions please see:\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/acad_standards/creative/disciplinary.html\nFurther documentation on how to respond to an allegation of a violation as a graduate student:\n25\n\n\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/academic-integrity/grads.html\nImportant Note: MCDS implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program\u201d. We have adopted the following hearing procedure and \u201ctwo strikes\u201d rule:\n\nIf an instructor determines that an academic integrity violation has occurred, both the instructor and students are given the opportunity to explain the situation to the MCDS program committee. A written hearing by email suffices for this purpose.\nThe program committee then reviews all information and decides whether the violation is deemed an infraction (see 3.3.17), and which secondary actions are to be taken on the program level.\nTwo-Strike-Rule: MCDS may dismiss students upon a first AIV infraction. A second infraction will always lead to the offending student being dismissed from the program, with no exceptions.\nThe MCDS program reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, the degree will be withdrawn promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this university policy https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- at: life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html\nis\navailable\n4 Academic Policies\n4.1 MCDS Academic Policies\n4.1.1 Duration of Study\nMCDS students enrolled for full-time studies are normally expected to complete the degree in three semesters (16 months). This includes a summer internship.\n4.1.2 Double-Dipping\nA Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval.\n4.1.3 Pass/Fail and Audit Grades\nPass/fail and audit grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail or audit option for these courses.\n26\n\n\n4.1.4 Transfer Credit\nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another institution, may be permitted to satisfy one of the MCDS course requirements, with permission from the Director. Students must petition for transfer credit by providing the Program Director with the prior course syllabus and other details that may be required by the Director in order to make a decision. See the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption\u201d. NOTE: In all cases, credit may only be transferred from another degree program for courses deemed \u201cfree electives\u201d - i.e., courses which were not used to satisfy a core requirement or total units requirement in a prior degree program.\nAll MS students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU.\n4.1.5 External Internships and Job Interviewing\nMCDS students are expected to attain an external internship during the summer. International students must coordinate carefully with the University, due to visa restrictions. International students are required to consult with the Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract.\nWe caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) implications with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their academic advisor before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your own inventions if they occur during an external internship.\nWhile it is necessary for students to travel off-campus for job interviews, it is not acceptable for a student to miss a course requirement or a capstone project commitment due to interview travel. Students should work proactively with prospective employers to arrange interview travel in a way that minimizes the impact on their final semester course work.\n4.1.6 Transferring into the MCDS Program\nDirect transfers into the MCDS program are not permitted. Students who are currently enrolled at Carnegie Mellon who wish to transfer into the MCDS program must do so by applying to the MCDS program via the normal admissions process. As specified in Sec. 4.1.4 in this document, some transfer credit and/or exemption from MCDS requirements may be possible on a case-by-case basis.\n4.1.7 Transferring Out of the MCDS Program\nThe MCDS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MCDS degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired\n27\n\n\ndegree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to request such a transfer.\n4.1.8 Statute of Limitations\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html\nAs outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations (link above), students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program.\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.\n4.2 LTI Academic Policies\n4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy\nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. In unusual cases, the Director may approve exceptions to the program requirements.\n4.2.2 Course Drop/Add/withdrawal procedures\nStudents taking undergraduate and Master\u2019s level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes/index.html.\nThere is a separate calendar for masters level courses.\n4.2.3 Courses with restricted enrollment\nMCDS students have priority for the program core courses. The MCDS program administrators cannot intercede with other departments to secure seats for its students in other courses as all departments reserve seats for their accepted students. Usually all Students can, remaining open seats are assigned on a first- come, first-served basis.\n28\n\n\non occasion, contact the assigned course instructor in order to plead his/her case for admission to the course. Admission may be granted at the discretion of the instructor. The policy of the department offering the course(s) is always followed.\n4.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption\nThe LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the Director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.\n4.2.5 External Employment/Consulting\nSince the MCDS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment and/or consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss this with their advisor. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment.\n4.2.6 Leave of Absence\nA student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the program administrator to apply for a return to the program.\n4.2.7 Withdrawal from Program\nStudents may voluntarily withdraw from the MCDS program. If a student decides to withdraw, or is considering a withdrawal, she/he should contact the program administrator to schedule an advising meeting as soon as possible.\nThe university\u2019s general withdrawal policy can be found here:\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/leaves-and-withdrawals/\n4.2.8 Satisfactory Progress\nIf a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on \u201cEnd of Semester Evaluation\u201d. In particular, students in the three-semester program who fail one of their first-semester MCDS core required courses are strongly encouraged to consider switching to the four-semester program.\n4.2.9 Winter and Summer Breaks\n29\n\n\nStudents supported by research projects or working in an on-campus internship are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is typically allowed in the summer for the students who are working on campus (not pursuing an external internship). Supported students should arrange their winter break time with their supervisor.\n4.3 CMU Academic Policies\n4.3.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities http://www.cmu.edu/education-office/disability-resources/ The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability Resources' secure online portal (https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/) or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process.\nStudents with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268-6121.\n4.3.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program.\nYou can review a summary of the university\u2019s graduate student\u2019s appeal and grievance procedures here: https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html\n4.3.3 Safeguarding Educational Equity: Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault\n30\n\n\nThe University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith. The University\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual- misconduct/index.html.\nThe University\u2019s Policy Against Retaliation is available at: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html\nIf you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources:\nOffice of Title IX Initiatives: http://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/, 412-268-7125, tix@cmu.edu\nUniversity Police: https://www.cmu.edu/police/, 412-268-2323 \uf0b7 Additional resources and information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources-and-information/index.html\n4.3.4 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate Students\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html\nThis policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.\n4.3.5 Gestational and Parental Accommodations https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation- protocol.html\nStudents whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of the semester may consider taking time away from their coursework and/or research responsibilities. Any student who gives birth to a child while engaged in coursework or research is eligible to take either a short-term absence or formal leave of absence. Students are encouraged to consult with relevant university faculty and staff as soon as possible as they begin making plans regarding time away.\nStudents must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations. Students will complete an information form and meet with a member of the Dean\u2019s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student. 31\n\n\no Planning for the student\u2019s discussion with appropriate academic contact(s)\n(advisor, associate dean, etc.) may be reviewed during this meeting.\nStudents in course work should consider options for the semester of the anticipated birth such as working with their course instructors to receive incomplete grades, electing to drop to part-time status or taking a full semester leave of absence.\nStudents engaged in research must work with their faculty to develop plans for the research for the time they are away and for resuming upon return.\nMaster's students who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) weeks during a Short-Term Maternity Accommodation or a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six weeks is medically necessary. To receive this support students must be registered with the Office of the Dean of Students.\n4.3.6 Change of Address MCDS students are responsible for notifying MCDS and the HUB of all address changes in a timely manner. Students will be held responsible for any failure to receive official college notices due to not having a correct address on file; F-1 students may jeopardize their status if address information is not kept current. Students can change their address using SIO, which is available via the HUB website: http://www.cmu.edu/hub/index.html\n5 Financial Issues\n5.1 Tuition\n5.1.1 Tuition payments\nTo understand your invoice, payment options, etc., visit: http://www.cmu.edu/hub. The MCDS program sets tuition each year for all students in the program. The student must handle tuition problems by contacting The Hub. The MCDS Program Administrators cannot solve tuition problems.\n5.1.2 Sponsored Students\nA sponsored student is one who has another party (such as an embassy or company) who has agreed to pay the student\u2019s tuition. Please read the \u201cSponsored Students\u201d section.\n5.1.3 Employer Reimbursement Process\nIf you have an employer reimbursement plan, write your employer\u2019s name and address on the bill (or provide CMU with a letter of support) and pay at least one-third of the\n32\n\n\ntuition charge when returning the bill. You must pay previous semester balances before you can enroll for the next semester.\n5.1.4 Carnegie Mellon employee reimbursement procedure\nContact the Benefits Office for specific information on tuition benefits. You must complete a Tuition Remission Form each semester in order to receive these benefits. To the Human Resources website at: receive a Tuition Remission Form, visit http://www.cmu.edu/hr.\n5.1.5 Financial aid, tuition waivers, Scholarships\nThe MCDS degree program does not provide financial aid to graduate students, nor does it provide tuition waivers or scholarships. For complete financial aid information see: https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/index.html . The Financial Aid Office of Carnegie Mellon will provide assistance in completing the necessary paperwork to apply for Stafford loans.\nGraduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB we",
