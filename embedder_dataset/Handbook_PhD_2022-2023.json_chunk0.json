1.1\nIntroduction The PhD in Language and Information Technologies\nThe PhD in Language and Information Technologies (LTI PhD) is the doctoral degree offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. It is focused on understanding and extending the state of the art in computational linguistics, information retrieval, multimedia information retrieval, natural language processing, machine translation, speech processing, text mining, and other topics related to analysis of unstructured information (e.g., computational biology, machine learning, and software engineering of intelligent systems).\nThere are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to the standard information outlined below. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the PhD in Language and Information Technologies.\nWhile this handbook (and your college graduate student handbook) are specific to your academic experience in the department, there are several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook, the Office of the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, and others are included in Appendix A of this handbook.\nAll policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies described in The Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook and at the University Policies website.\n1.2 PhD Contact Information\nThe people responsible for administering the LTI PhD degree are:\nRobert Frederking Program Director, PhD (Fall Semester) Principal Systems Scientist GHC 6515 ref@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-6656\nJamie Callan Program Director, PhD (Spring/Summer Semester) Professor GHC 6415 callan@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-4525\nCaroline Ros\u00e9 Interim LTI Director and Professor GHC 5415 cprose@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-7130\nStacey Young Academic Program Manager, PhD Graduate Program Manager, LTI staceyy@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-2623\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 7\n\n\n1.3 University Policies and Expectations\nIt is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines. In addition to this departmental graduate student handbook, the following resources are available to assist you in understanding community expectations:\nThe Word/Student Handbook*\nAcademic Integrity Policy\nUniversity Policies Website\nwww.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword//index.html https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and- student-life/academic-integrity.html www.cmu.edu/policies/\nOffice of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs\nwww.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/index.html\nPublic Health and Safety Requirements\nwww.cmu.edu/coronavirus\n(Please see Appendix A for additional information about The Word and other university resources.)\n1.4 The Academic Calendar\nThe Academic calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html and provides information on all deadlines, including registration dates, class start dates, add/drop deadlines, exam dates, and more. Doctoral course-sections follow a separate Academic Calendar.\n1.5 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance\nCarnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment, or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state, or local laws or executive orders.\nInquiries concerning the application of a compliance with this statement should be directed to the university ombudsperson, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 (412-268-1018).\nObtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling 412-268-2000.\nCarnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report describing the university\u2019s security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault, and fire safety policies, and containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412-268-2323. The\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 1\n\n\nannual www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports .\nsecurity\nand\nfire\nsafety\nreport\nalso\nis\navailable\nonline\nat\nInformation regarding the application of Title IX, including to admission and employment decisions, the sexual misconduct grievance procedures, and process, including how to file a report or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment, and how the university responds to such reports is available at www.cmu.edu/title-ix. The Title IX coordinator may be reached at 412-268-7125 or tix@cmu.edu\n1.6 The Carnegie Mellon Code\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical, and moral conduct possible.\nThese standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.\nAs members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.\nThe discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.\nThe commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university. The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found here.\n2 2.1 Pittsburgh Campus Location\nThe Language Technologies Institute\nThe Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5th and 6th floors of the Gates Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Pittsburgh campus.\nThe address and contact information of the LTI are: Language Technologies Institute Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue Gates Hillman Complex Pittsburgh, PA 15241-3891\nLTI PhD Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 2\n\n\n412-268-6298 (fax) http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/\n2.2 Photocopies and Printers\nThe use of a photocopier or printer requires you to log in with your CMU ID card. LTI\u2019s printers are located in GHC 5404 and GHC 6604. The School of Computer Science provides a number of black-and-white and color printers for use by students. The SCS Computer SCS Computing Facilities publishes a list of printers online at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printer-list\n2.3 Computers for LTI PhD Students\nThe computer resources for LTI PhD students are typically provided by their advisors.\nPhD students will be given a CS user ID. A CS user ID is required to use the LTI computer cluster, department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science has a Help Center located at 4201. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu , extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line. (M-F, 9am-5pm)\nPhD students will be given access to the LTI\u2019s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or capstone projects. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.\n3 Certification\nPhD Degree Attainment - Standard Degree Requirements & Degree\n3.1 Overview of LTI PhD Degree Requirements\nIn order to complete the PhD in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must satisfy the following requirements:\nPass at least 96 units of graduate level courses, with additional requirements detailed below\nSatisfy proficiencies in Writing, Presentation, Programming, and Teaching \u2022 Propose, write, and defend a PhD dissertation (thesis)\nThe student must also attend the LTI Colloquium (11-700) each semester and satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement described elsewhere.
