    "doc_text": "it cannot be counted as a Qualifying course.\n5.1.5 Maximum and Minimum Course Loads\nA student in the program may not take more than sixty (60) units per semester without permission from the program director.\nA student in the program must be registered for a minimum thirty-six (36) units per semester to be considered a full-time student or twelve (12) units per semester to be considered a part- time student. All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status. Reduced Course Load is not permitted for MIIS students. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, \u201cpermit of stay\u201d). (MIIS policy)\n5.1.6 Pass/Fail Grades\nPass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement, except for the 11-696 (A) Capstone Planning Seminar and 11-935 (R) LTI Practicum that are a Pass/Fail. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.\n5.1.7 Transfer Credit\nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the MIIS breadth requirements. The decision on whether a course may be used to satisfy a breadth requirement is made by the MIIS Program Director. Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision.\nSatisfying a breadth requirement with a course from another institution does not reduce the number of CMU course units that must be taken to attain the MIIS degree.\nSee the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption\u201d on page 23.\n5.1.8 Transferring Into the MIIS Program\nTransfers into the MIIS program are not permitted during a student\u2019s first semester at CMU. Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them.\nStudents may request to transfer into the MIIS program after completing their first semester and before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MIIS Program Director. The MIIS Program Director will inform\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 22\n\n\nthe student about what application materials are required, for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities.\nThe MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request. The program will explicitly consider whether the coursework done prior to the transfer will allow the student to be \u201con schedule\u201d by the end of the spring semester, so that the student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall semester.\nMIIS students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS-16 to MIIS-21 and vice versa) after beginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests must be filed within the first semester of the program. It is highly recommended to not switch tracks more than once! Though not forbidden, multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration records of international students. Students also must understand that extension of their stay in the program will lead to additional financial obligations.\nU.S. citizens, virtually, have no restrictions on how many times they can switch if it is done for a legitimate reason. To confirm legitimacy of the reason to switch tracks ALL students must seek their advisor's approval and the approval of the Director of the MIIS program.\n5.1.9 Transferring Out of the MIIS Program\nThe MIIS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MIIS degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.\n5.1.10 Statute of Limitations\nAll units required for the master\u2019s degree, whether earned in residence or transferred from another institution, must be recorded on the transcript within seven years of the date on which the student enrolled in the program (CMU policy1), or less if required by a more restrictive department, school, or college policy. This statutory period can be extended by the SCS Associate Dean for Graduate Education for special circumstances that do not make it possible for the student to complete the requirements within the statutory period. Any request for a waiver of the statute of limitations for the MIIS degree must be approved by the Department Head and by the SCS Associate Dean for Graduate Education. The waiver request must explain the exceptional circumstances that warrant an extension. For cases in which a\n1 https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 23\n\n\nwaiver is granted, the waiver will cover specific courses and will specify a time period for completion of the program.\nAs outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations, https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program.\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.\nSee also the \u2018Duration of Study\u2019 policy.\n5.2 LTI Academic Policies\n5.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy\nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period.\n5.2.2 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption\nThe LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 24\n\n\n5.2.3 External Employment/Consulting\nSince the MIIS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment and/or consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss this with their Advisor. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment.\n5.2.4 Leave of Absence\nThe LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.\n5.2.5 Satisfactory Progress\nIf a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program or strongly encourage the student to consider switching to the four-semester program (MIIS-21) to complete all the requirements. See section on \u201cEnd of Semester Review\u201d on page 17.\n5.2.6 Winter and Summer Breaks\nStudents supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is typically allowed in the summer. The normal winter break policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks and takes vacation for the other two weeks.\n5.3 CMU Academic Policies\n5.3.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/education-office/disability-resources/\nThe Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability Resources' secure online portal (https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/) or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 25\n\n\nStudents with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self- identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268- 6121.\n5.3.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures\nGraduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program. Additionally, students may confer with the graduate student ombudsperson, Suzie Laurich- McIntyre, slaurichmcintyre@cmu.edu, on issues of process or other concerns as they navigate conflicts.\n5.3.3 Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault\nThe University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence, and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith.\nThe University\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual-misconduct/index.html.\nThe University\u2019s Policy Against Retaliation is available at\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html.\nIf you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources:\n\uf0a7 Office of Title IX Initiatives\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/, 412-268-7125, tix@cmu.edu\no\n\uf0a7 University Police\no https://www.cmu.edu/police/, 412-268-2323\nAdditional resources and information can be found at:\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 26\n\n\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources-and-information/resources.html.\n5.3.4 Childbirth/Maternity Accommodation Protocol\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html\nStudents whose anticipated delivery date is during the semester may consider taking time away from their coursework and/or research responsibilities. Any student who gives birth to a child while engaged in coursework or research is eligible to take either a short-term absence or formal leave of absence. Students are encouraged to consult with relevant university faculty and staff as soon as possible as they begin making plans regarding time away.\nStudents must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations. Students will complete an information form and meet with a member of the Dean\u2019s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student.\no Planning for the student\u2019s discussion with appropriate academic contact(s)\n(advisor, associate dean, etc.) may be reviewed during this meeting.\nStudents in course work should consider options for the semester of the anticipated birth such as working with their course instructors to receive incomplete grades, electing to drop to part-time status or taking a full semester leave of absence.\nStudents engaged in research must work with their faculty to develop plans for the research for the time they are away and for resuming upon return.\nMaster's students who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) weeks during a Short- Term Maternity Accommodation or a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks if an absence longer than six weeks is medically necessary. To receive this support students must be registered with the Office of the Dean of Students.\n5.3.5 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate\nStudents\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html\nThis policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual, or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 27\n\n\nconflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.\n5.3.6 Employment Eligibility Verification\nIf you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/hr/restrict/employment-eligibility-verification-policy.pdf covering the university\u2019s I-9 and E-Verify requirements:\nEvery individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment.\n\nIndividuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required.\nFor more information, please see CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/recruiting/restrict/i-9- guidance.pdf , or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify https://www.cmu.edu/hr/service-center/new-faculty-staff/i-9-e- verify/index.html and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9 https://go.oncehub.com/I9Appointment.\n6 Financial Issues\n6.1 Graduate Student Funding\nThe LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional master\u2019s programs. Students are encouraged to seek financial aid and support from other sources. The HUB website (https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/index.html) provides the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links. Additional information on financial issues for graduate students can be found on the web at http://www.cmu.edu/hub/new-grad/.\nTeaching assistantships are awarded to faculty members who then award these positions to selected students. Teaching assistant duties include, but are not limited to, holding office hours, conducting recitation classes, and grading. There are minimum English proficiency requirements that must be met for a student to accept a teaching assistantship. Pennsylvania\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 28\n\n\nstate law requires that all students who are not native speakers of English take and pass a state administered proficiency test. Support for teaching activities can be found through the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence, located in Warner Hall 425. Students who will be T.A.s for the department are encouraged to visit the Teaching Center and to take advantage of the information and services located there.\nStudents in the professional master\u2019s programs are not prohibited from seeking support as Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants. However, typically, fulltime master\u2019s students do not have time for these activities. Research Assistantships are most likely to be awarded to students in CMU\u2019s research-oriented degree programs.\nMIIS students can apply for TA positions only with the permission of the program director. Teaching Assistantships are especially discouraged for first semester students.\n6.2 University Financial Aid\nGraduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website (http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/graduate/index.html.) Students will find the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links.\n6.3 Health Insurance\nCarnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree seeking students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered by the University or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is \u201cenrolled as the dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance plan\u201d (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-health-insurance.html.\nIt is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester or elect a payment plan over the course of the academic year. More information is available at the Student Health Services Web site www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/HealthServices/insurance.\n6.4 Emergency Loans\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/sfs/billing/emergency-loans.html\nAll students regardless of their program are eligible for the Emergency Student Loan, which is an interest-free and emergency-based loan repayable within 30 days. It is available through the\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 29\n\n\nOffice of the Dean of Student Affairs; students may apply for the loan by stopping into the Student Affairs Office, Warner Hall 301, or by calling (412) 268-2075 for an appointment.\n6.5 Office of the Dean of Students Emergency Support Funding\nGraduate students who find themselves in need of immediate funds for emergency situations should contact the Office of the Dean of Students (see Appendix A), www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/index.html, to inquire about the types of emergency funding available to enrolled students.\n7 Additional University Resources\n7.1 The HUB Student Services Center\nthehub@andrew.cmu.edu and http://www.cmu.edu/hub/\nThe HUB is located in Warner Hall, Lower Level. The HUB staff delivers comprehensive service and counsel to students and families regarding financial aid, billing and payment, registration, and academic records. The Assistant Directors in The HUB serves as contacts for specific colleges and assist enrolled students with key aspects of the enrollment process. Student can find their assigned HUB Assistant Director on their Student Information Online (SIO) Resource page. Questions that need specialized, in-depth attention can be directed to the student's assigned Assistant Director. For general questions and information, students may email The HUB or call 412-268-8186.\n7.2 Student Information Online (SIO)\nStudent Information Online (SIO) is a secure site where students can find important, personalized information, including E-Bills and student account information, financial aid status and eligibility, grades and QPA, and course schedules. Students can update their and their spouse's or domestic partner's contact information, sign up for E-Check & E-Refund, authorize their spouses, domestic partners or other individual to receive a copy of their E-Bill, request verifications, view their housing and meal plan assignments, and much more. Students can log on to SIO by going to www.cmu.edu/hub/sio and entering their Andrew User ID and password.\nOn SIO, students will designate an emergency contact address of a relative or family friend to be contacted in the case of an emergency. If students do not want their name and address published in the campus directory, they must notify the HUB in writing.\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 30\n\n\nMIIS students are responsible for notifying the University of all address changes in a timely manner. Students will be held responsible for any failure to receive official college notices due to not having a correct address on file; F-1 students may jeopardize their status if address information is not kept current.\nStudents can change their address using SIO, which is available via the HUB website (http://www.cmu.edu/hub/index.html).\n7.3 ID Cards\nGraduate students can obtain their ID card from The HUB once they have been entered into SIO for the semester. These cards identify their holders as members of the campus community. Student cards are deactivated upon the cardholder\u2019s separation from the university.\nAffiliate ID Cards are available for spouses and partners of graduate students that allow them to access Carnegie Mellon\u2019s campus. These cards are available through The HUB to spouses and partners of graduate students who are enrolled for the current academic year in a full-time graduate degree program. The card is valid for one year. For information about domestic partner registration, visit the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs webpage: https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/domestic-partner/index.html.\nFor more information about student and affiliate ID cards (spouse, domestic partners and dependent children), please visit: https://www.cmu.edu/idplus/idcards/index.html.\n7.4 Transcripts\nInformation about and instructions for ordering transcripts are available at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/transcripts/. Transcript questions may be directed to uro-transcripts@andrew.cmu.edu.\n7.5 Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-student- status.html\nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross- registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken,\nMIIS Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 31\n\n\nbut without grades. Such courses will not be considered for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations.\nStudents interested in taking advantage of this opportunity should be familiar with the Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses already outlined previously in this handbook.\n7.6 Student Privacy Rights and FERPA\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/privacy-rights-students.html\nThis university policy notifies students of their rights under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). According to FERPA, students have the right to:\n\u2022\ninspect and review their education records; request an amendment to ",
