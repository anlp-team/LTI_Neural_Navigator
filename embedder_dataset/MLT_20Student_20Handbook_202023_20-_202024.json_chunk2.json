Normally only one Independent Study would be approved during a student\u2019s MLT coursework.\n5.1.5 Transfer Credit\nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the MLT course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the MLT Program Director. Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision.\nSee the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption.\u201d\nAll MLT students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU.\n5.1.6 External Internships\nMLT students may only engage in internships if their advisors recommend it, since the program is 24 months, including summers. International students are required to consult with the Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract.\nWe caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas.\nImportant: See also section 4.2.3, External Employment/Consulting.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 21\n\n\n5.1.7 Transferring Into the MLT Program\nTransfers into the MLT program are not permitted during a student\u2019s first semester at CMU. Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them; this is a university policy.\nStudents may request to transfer into the MLT program after completing their first semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MLT/PhD Admissions Chair. The MLT/PhD Admissions Chair will inform the student about what application materials are required; for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. The MLT program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request.\n5.1.8 Transferring Out of the MLT Program\nThe MLT program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MLT degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to request such a transfer.\n5.1.9 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures\nStudents taking undergraduate and Masters\u2019 level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, and withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course- changes.index. Please note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does not apply to Masters\u2019 students.\n5.1.10 Statute of Limitations\nAs outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations, https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html. Students will complete all requirements for the masters\u2019 degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a masters\u2019 student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school, or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a masters\u2019 degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered masters\u2019 degree program under criteria determined by that program.\nSee also the \u2018Duration of Study\u2019 policy.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 22\n\n\n5.1.11 Teaching Requirements\nMLT students do not normally serve as Teaching Assistants (TAs). If an MLT student wants to TA a course, they must get the approval of their research advisor.\nIn the unusual case of an MLT student TAing, note that graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full University policy can be reviewed at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency- instructors.html.\nThe fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA. In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory screening for all non-native speakers of English), Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the Student Academic Success Center website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/.\n5.2 LTI Academic Policies\n5.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy\nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.\n5.2.2 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption\nThe LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the chair of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course, but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 23\n\n\n5.2.3 External Employment/Consulting\nStudents funded by LTI research projects are normally expected to work exclusively for those projects. Since consulting may provide useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult, at most, one eight-hour day per seven-day week, only with the advisor's consent. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE); otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status.\nImportant: Any work for pay outside of the funding research project must be approved in advance by the advisor (and OIE, for international students). This includes paid TAing, consulting, online free-lancing, etc.\n5.2.4 Leave of Absence\nThe LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.\n5.2.5 Satisfactory Progress\nIf a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on \u201cEnd of Semester Evaluation.\u201d\n5.2.6 Winter and Summer Breaks\nStudents supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is typically allowed in the summer. The normal winter break policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks, and takes vacation for the other two weeks.\n5.3 CMU Academic Policies\n5.3.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources\nThe Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the Carnegie Mellon community. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 24\n\n\nthe process through Disability Resources\u2019 secure online portal or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process.\nStudents with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self- identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu or call 412-268-6121.\n5.3.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html\nGraduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program.\n5.3.3 Process for Appealing Final Grades\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and academic- actions.html Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit, or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor, and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal:\na) The final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam)\nb) The faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of\nUniversity policy.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 25\n\n\n5.3.4 Safeguarding Educational Equity: Sexual Misconduct Policy\nThe University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence, and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith. The University\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and- governance/sexual-misconduct/index.html. The University\u2019s Policy Against Retaliation is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html. If you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources:\nOffice of Title IX Initiatives, https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/ 412-268-7125, tix@cmu.edu\nUniversity Police, 412-268-2323\nAdditional resources and information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources- and-information/resources.html.\n5.3.5 Gestational and Parental Accommodation\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation protocol.html\nProviding holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols on this page are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families.\nStudents seeking any of the parental accommodations described below must register with the Office of the Dean of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling 412- 268-2075.\nStudents are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstances. At the time of registration, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, procedures, funding options, and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with the student\u2019s academic department. Students should also consult with their academic advisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of Students.\nAccommodations for Gestational Parents The birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic pursuits for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away from their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two options as a possible accommodation:\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 26\n\n\nShort-term accommodation for gestational parents \u2013 A short-term absence from academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks. Short term accommodations may be extended by two (2) weeks for a total of eight (8) weeks, where a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include extensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping courses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a short-term accommodation will remain enrolled.\nFormal Leave of Absence - A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave Policy. Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full-semester, mini-semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the leave is taken. Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student- leave.html) drop all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for the semester. International students must consult with the Office of International Education (https://www.cmu.edu/oie/) before considering this option due to visa implications.\nFinancial Assistance for Student Parents Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who become parents while enrolled:\nInterest-free Loan \u2013 Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest-free parental loan (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/) from the Office of the Dean of Students.\n6 Financial Issues\n6.1 Graduate Student Funding\nFor all LTI MLT students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year. This support is normally continued for the duration of the program, subject to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition and fees, and a monthly MLT stipend. In addition, the LTI pays a dependency allowance of 10% of the student's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless they have a spouse who earns more than $200 per month.\nIf an MLT student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is expected to accept it in place of the LTI\u2019s graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, the LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 27\n\n\nstipend 10 percent higher than that of the standard LTI graduate fellowship. Students are required to inform the LTI about any external funding that they receive.\n6.2 University Financial Aid\nGraduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website: http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/graduate/index.html.\n6.3 Conference Travel Funding\nStudents funded by a research project receive travel funding according to policies set by the individual projects. Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding, with a larger amount available for travel to present a refereed conference paper. There is an LTI form that must be filled out in advance.\n6.4 Office of the Dean of Students Emergency Support Funding\nGraduate students who find themselves in need of immediate funds for emergency situations should contact the Office of the Dean of Students (see Appendix A), www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/index.html, to inquire about the types of emergency funding available to enrolled students.\n6.5 Health Insurance\nCarnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree-seeking students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered by the University, or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is \u201cenrolled as the dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance plan\u201d (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/StudentInsurance).\nThe LTI does not cover student health insurance, regardless of the students\u2019 funding situation. It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester, or elect a payment plan over the course of the academic year. More information is available at the Student Health Services Web site www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/HealthServices/insurance.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 28\n\n\n6.6 Emergency Loans\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/index.html All students, regardless of their program, are eligible for the Emergency Student Loan, which is an interest-free and emergency-based loan repayable within 30 days. It is available through the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs; students may apply for the loan by stopping in to the Student Affairs Office, Warner Hall 301, or by calling (412) 268-2075 for an appointment.\n6.7 Employment Eligibility Verification\nIf you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf] covering the university\u2019s I-9 and E-Verify requirements:\nEvery individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU\n\nmust comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment. Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required.\nFor more information, please see CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU [pdf], or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9.\nStudents who fail to complete the Form I-9 in a timely manner may have stipend payments suspended. If employed by the university, an individual who fails to timely complete the Form I-9 may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.\n7 Additional University Resources\n7.1 The HUB Student Services Center\nthehub@andrew.cmu.edu and http://www.cmu.edu/hub/\nThe HUB is located in Warner Hall, Lower Level. The HUB staff delivers comprehensive service and counsel to students and families regarding financial aid, billing and payment, registration and academic records. The Assistant Directors in The HUB serve as contacts for specific colleges\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 29\n\n\nand assist enrolled students with key aspects of the enrollment process. Students can find their assigned HUB Assistant Director on their Student Information Online (SIO) Resource page. Questions that need specialized, in-depth attention can be directed to the student's assigned Assistant Director. For general questions and information, students may email The HUB or call 412-268-8186.\n7.2 Student Information Online (SIO)\nStudent Information Online (SIO) is a secure site where students can find important, personalized information, including E-Bills and student account information, financial aid status and eligibility, grades and QPA, and course schedules. Students can update their contact information (and that of their spouse or partner); sign up for E-Check & E-Refund; authorize their spouses, domestic partners or other individuals to receive a copy of their E-Bill; request verifications; view their housing and meal plan assignments; and much more. Students can log on to SIO by going to www.cmu.edu/hub/sio and entering their Andrew User ID and password.\nOn SIO, students will designate an emergency contact address of a relative or family friend to be contacted in the case of an emergency. If students do not want their name and address published in the campus directory, they must notify the HUB in writing.\n7.3 ID Cards\nGraduate students can obtain their ID card from their program manager, department, or college. These cards identify their holders as members of the campus community. Student cards are deactivated upon the cardholder\u2019s separation from the university.\nAffiliate ID Cards are available for spouses and partners of graduate students, which allow them to access Carnegie Mellon\u2019s campus. These cards are available through The HUB to spouses and partners of graduate students who are enrolled for the current academic year in a full-time graduate degree program. The card is valid for one year. For information about domestic partner registration, visit the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs webpage: http://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/dean/domestic_partner/.\nFor more information about student and affiliate ID cards (spouse, domestic partners and dependent children), please visit: http://www.cmu.edu/idplus/idcards/cardtypes.html.\n7.4 Transcripts\nInformation about and instructions for ordering transcripts are available at: www.cmu.edu/hub/transcripts.html. Transcript questions may be directed to esg-\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 30\n\n\ntranscripts@andrew.cmu.edu.\n7.5 Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/CrossRegister.html\nCross-registration provides an opportunity for enriched educational programs by permitting full-time graduate students to cross-register for courses (usually no more than one per semester) at a Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) Institution. Full-time Carnegie Mellon degree students are eligible and the PCHE course may not count towards full-time status unless the student is enrolled in an inter-university program. Students interested in taking advantage of this opportunity should be familiar with the Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses already outlined previously in this handbook.\nNote: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college and department policies allow this.\n7.6 Student Privacy Rights and FERPA\nwww.cmu.edu/policies/documents/StPrivacy.html This university policy notifies students of their rights under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). According to FERPA, students have the right to:\n\u2022\ninspect and review their education records; request an amendment to their education record if they believe they are inaccurate or misleading; request a hearing if their request for an amendment is not resolved to their satisfaction;\n\u2022 consent to disclosure of personally identifiable information from their education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent; file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Family Policy Compliance Office if they believe their rights under FERPA have been violated.\n\nFor questions about Student Privacy Rights, FERPA or filing a complaint, contact John Papinchak, University Registrar, jp7p@andrew.cmu.edu, in Enrollment Services.\n7.7 Academic Calendar\nThe official academic calendar is published by Enrollment Services. It is not uncommon for departments and colleges to have academic requirements that differ from or are in addition to those presented in the academic calendar provided to the campus community by Enrollment\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 31\n\n\nServices. You may find the CMU academic calendar here: www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar.html. This provides information on deadlines including registration dates, class start dates, add/drop deadlines, and more.\n7.8 Professional Development\nThe Caree",
