The ADLES-VFT Algorithm Summarized The overall ADLES-VFT algorithm for solving the parameter estimation problem (29)\u2013(35) is summarized in Algorithm 2. In this solution, we have adopted the simple gradient descent method. However, other gradient-based optimization approaches, such as the conjugate gradient method, can also be used. We note here that Algorithm 2 requires several terms to be speci\ufb01ed. In our imple- mentation, the quiescent positions of the vocal folds, Cr and Cl were set to 0. We initialize [\u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206] = [0.8, 0.32, 1.0]\u2014these values were empirically found to work best. f (x, t) is ini- tialized to 0. This effectively initializes Equation (4) to the Webster Horn equation. The step sizes \u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b2 and \u03c4 are all adaptively set to 0.01/max(F\u03b1, F\u03b2, F\u2206), and \u03b9 is set to 1. The actual objective minimize, Equation (29), requires scaling pm(t) by A(L)/\u03c1c prior to comparison to uL(t). In practice, since pm(t) is derived from a voice signal recorded at a distance from the lips, the unknown transmission loss between the lips and the microphone must also be considered. To deal with this, we simply normalize both sequences to 0 mean and unit variance, and do not apply any additional scaling. \u2206 Algorithm 2 ADLES-VFT algorithm 1: Initialize \u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206 and"}, {"question": " What do the boundary conditions in the text relate to?,        answer: The air volume velocity at the glottal end of the vocal tract.

The actual objective minimize, Equation (29), requires scaling pm(t) by A(L)/\u03c1c prior to comparison to uL(t). In practice, since pm(t) is derived from a voice signal recorded at a distance from the lips, the unknown transmission loss between the lips and the microphone must also be considered.

Updating f : We denote the estimation residual as: r(t) = um(t) \u2212 H f (u0(t)) We must propagate this residual backward through the VT model. To do so, we use a time reversal technique [36] and backpropagate the difference (41) into the vocal tract, which gives: \u22022z \u2202t2 = c2 \u22022z \u2202x2 + f (x, t) subject to (B.C.1) (I.C.1) (I.C.2) \u2202z \u2202n\u0393 z(x, T) = 0 \u2202z(x, T) \u2202t = r = 0 where z is the time reversal of u.

The ADLES-VFT Algorithm Summarized The overall ADLES-VFT algorithm for solving the parameter estimation problem (29)\u2013(35) is summarized in Algorithm 2. In this solution, we have adopted the simple gradient descent method. However, other gradient-based optimization approaches, such as the conjugate gradient method, can also be used. We note here that Algorithm 2 requires several terms to be speci\ufb01ed. In our imple- mentation, the quiescent positions of the vocal folds, Cr and Cl were set to 0. We initialize [\u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206] = [0.8, 0.32, 1.0]\u2014these values were empirically found to work best. f (x, t) is ini- tialized to 0. This effectively initializes Equation (4) to the Webster Horn equation. The step sizes \u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b2 and \u03c4 are all adaptively set to 0.01/max(F\u03b1, F\u03b2, F\u2206), and \u03b9 is set to 1. The actual objective minimize, Equation (29), requires scaling pm(t) by A(L)/\u03c1c prior to comparison to uL(t). In practice, since pm(t) is derived from a voice signal recorded at a distance from the lips, the unknown transmission loss between the lips and the microphone must also be considered. To deal with this, we simply normalize both sequences to 0 mean and unit variance, and do not apply any additional scaling. \u2206 Algorithm 2 ADLES-VFT algorithm 1: Initialize \u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206 and"}, {"question": " What technique is used to backpropagate the difference into the vocal tract?,        answer: Time reversal technique.

The ADLES-VFT Algorithm Summarized The overall ADLES-VFT algorithm for solving the parameter estimation problem (29)\u2013(35) is summarized in Algorithm 2. In this solution, we have adopted the simple gradient descent method. However, other gradient-based optimization approaches, such as the conjugate gradient method, can also be used. We note here that Algorithm 2 requires several terms to be speci\ufb01ed. In our imple- mentation, the quiescent positions of the vocal folds, Cr and Cl were set to 0. We initialize [\u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206] = [0.8, 0.32, 1.0]\u2014these values were empirically found to work best. f (x, t) is ini- tialized to 0.

The actual objective minimize, Equation (29), requires scaling pm(t) by A(L)/\u03c1c prior to comparison to uL(t). In practice, since pm(t) is derived from a voice signal recorded at a distance from the lips, the unknown transmission loss between the lips and the microphone must also be considered. To deal with this, we simply normalize both sequences to 0 mean and unit variance, and do not apply any additional scaling. \u2206 Algorithm 2 ADLES-VFT algorithm 1: Initialize \u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206 and"}, {"question": " What is the learning rate parameter denoted as in the text?,        answer: \u03b9    ", "ref_chunk": "Equations (36)\u2013(40) represent a set of partial differential equations.

Updating f : We denote the estimation residual as: r(t) = um(t) \u2212 H f (u0(t)) We must propagate this residual backward through the VT model. To do so, we use a time reversal technique [36] and backpropagate the difference (41) into the vocal tract, which gives: \u22022z \u2202t2 = c2 \u22022z \u2202x2 + f (x, t) subject to (B.C.1) (I.C.1) (I.C.2) \u2202z \u2202n\u0393 z(x, T) = 0 \u2202z(x, T) \u2202t = r = 0 where z is the time reversal of u. Note that the boundary conditions and initial conditions in (42)\u2013(45) are now de\ufb01ned at the lip, and the equation itself propagates backward through the vocal tract. 12 of 39 (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 As before, Equations (42)\u2013(45) can be solved by the \ufb01nite-element method of Appendix E to give us z(x, t). The gradient update rule for f (x, t) is then obtained as f \u2190\u2212 f + \u03b9 (cid:16) z c2 + u (cid:17) . where \u03b9 is a learning rate parameter (see Appendix D). Updating \u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206: As in the case of the backward approach of Section 4.1 we de\ufb01ne a residual R(t) = uL(t) \u2212 um(t) = H f ( \u02dccd(2\u03be0 + \u03bel(t) + \u03ber(t))) \u2212 A(L) \u03c1c pm(t) Note that unlike in Section 4.1 the residual in Equation (47) is de\ufb01ned at the lips, rather than at the glottis. As before, we can de\ufb01ne the total squared residual error as F(\u03bel, \u03ber; \u03d1) = (cid:90) T 0 R2(t)dt where \u03d1 = [\u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206] are the parameters of the vocal folds model (3). F must be minimized with respect to \u03d1, subject to the constraints imposed by the VFO model. Once again, as in Section 4.1 we fold in the constraints into the objective through Lagrangian multipliers as L(\u03d1) = (cid:90) T 0 +\u03b7 (cid:20) R2 + \u03bb (cid:18) \u00a8\u03bel + \u03b2 (cid:18) \u00a8\u03ber + \u03b2 (cid:16) 1 + \u03be2 r (cid:17) (cid:16) 1 + \u03be2 l (cid:17) \u02d9\u03bel + \u03bel + \u2206 \u03ber \u2212 \u03b1(cid:0) \u02d9\u03ber + \u02d9\u03bel (cid:19)(cid:21) \u02d9\u03ber + \u03ber \u2212 2 \u03bel \u2212 \u03b1(cid:0) \u02d9\u03ber + \u02d9\u03bel \u2206 (cid:1) dt 2 (cid:1) (cid:19) + \u00b5l(\u03bel(0) \u2212 Cl) + \u00b5r(\u03ber(0) \u2212 Cr) + \u03bdl \u02d9\u03bel(0) + \u03bdr \u02d9\u03ber(0) where \u03bb, \u03b7, \u00b5 and \u03bd are multipliers, and \u03bb and \u03b7 are themselves functions of time. Opti- mization requires minimization of L(\u03d1) with respect to \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u2206. This leads us (Appendix D) to the following set of equations for \u03bb and \u03b7: \u00a8\u03bb + \u00a8\u03b7 + (cid:18) 2\u03b2\u03ber \u02d9\u03ber + 1 \u2212 (cid:18) 2\u03b2\u03bel \u02d9\u03bel + 1 + \u2206 (cid:19) 2 \u2206 (cid:19) \u03bb + 2 \u02dccdR 2 \u03b7 + 2 \u02dccdR uL u0 uL u0 = 0 = 0 \u03b2 (cid:16) 1 + \u03be2 r (cid:17) \u03bb \u2212 \u03b1(\u03bb + \u03b7) = 0 \u03b2 (cid:16) 1 + \u03be2 l (cid:17) \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b1(\u03bb + \u03b7) = 0 with initial conditions (at t = T, i.e., at the lips): \u03bb(T) = 0 \u02d9\u03bb(T) = 0 \u03b7(T) = 0 \u02d9\u03b7(T) = 0 Given R(t), u0(t) and uL(t) Equations (50)\u2013(57) represent a set of differential-algebraic equations and can be solved with a DAE solver. 13 of 39 (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) (57) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 We \ufb01nally obtain the derivative of F w.r.t. \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u2206 (represented below as F\u03b1, F\u03b2 and F\u2206, respectively) as F\u03b1 = F\u03b2 = F\u2206 = (cid:90) T 0 (cid:90) T 0 (cid:90) T 0 \u2212(cid:0) \u02d9\u03ber + \u02d9\u03bel (cid:17) (cid:16)(cid:16) 1 + \u03be2 r (cid:1)(\u03bb + \u03b7)dt \u02d9\u03ber\u03bb + (cid:16) 1 + \u03be2 l 1 2 (\u03bel\u03b7 \u2212 \u03ber\u03bb)dt (cid:17) \u02d9\u03bel\u03b7 (cid:17) dt The gradient descent update rules for the VFO model parameters are \ufb01nally ob- tained as \u03b1 \u2190\u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c4\u03b1F\u03b1 \u03b2 \u2190\u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03c4\u03b2F\u03b2 \u2206 \u2190\u2212 \u2206 \u2212 \u03c4 F\u2206 \u2206 4.2.3. The ADLES-VFT Algorithm Summarized The overall ADLES-VFT algorithm for solving the parameter estimation problem (29)\u2013(35) is summarized in Algorithm 2. In this solution, we have adopted the simple gradient descent method. However, other gradient-based optimization approaches, such as the conjugate gradient method, can also be used. We note here that Algorithm 2 requires several terms to be speci\ufb01ed. In our imple- mentation, the quiescent positions of the vocal folds, Cr and Cl were set to 0. We initialize [\u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206] = [0.8, 0.32, 1.0]\u2014these values were empirically found to work best. f (x, t) is ini- tialized to 0. This effectively initializes Equation (4) to the Webster Horn equation. The step sizes \u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b2 and \u03c4 are all adaptively set to 0.01/max(F\u03b1, F\u03b2, F\u2206), and \u03b9 is set to 1. The actual objective minimize, Equation (29), requires scaling pm(t) by A(L)/\u03c1c prior to comparison to uL(t). In practice, since pm(t) is derived from a voice signal recorded at a distance from the lips, the unknown transmission loss between the lips and the microphone must also be considered. To deal with this, we simply normalize both sequences to 0 mean and unit variance, and do not apply any additional scaling. \u2206 Algorithm 2 ADLES-VFT algorithm 1: Initialize \u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206 and"}
