For a speci\ufb01c SS, D50 decreased with an increase in the degree of internal mixing, implying that enhancing the internal mixing level facilitated the CCN activity. Particularly, the variation in the mixing state exhibits high sensitivity to D50 when the ratio drops from 0.5 to 0.3. This can be attributed to the increases in the internal mixing level during the aerosol aging process, leading to an enhancement in aerosol chemical homogeneity and hygroscopicity. The relationship between (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 and D50 can be well \ufb01t- ted with an exponential function under the conditions of SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. However, under the condition of SS = 0.1%, their relationship is hard to be adequately \ufb01tted. Fur- ther analysis of the relationship (SS = 0.1%) revealed that the relatively high values of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 (0.3\u20130.4) with small D50 (<165 nm) occurred under high PM2.5 concentra- tion (>60 \u00b5g m\u22123) and high RH (>60%) conditions (Figure S2), leading to the relationship deviated from satisfactory \ufb01tting by using an exponential function. Under these condi- tions, the hygroscopicity and size of aerosol particles were enlarged due to the increasing fraction of nitrate and hygroscopic growth, respectively. Especially for the fog period, the droplets had a more diverse population of \u03ba values, as separated by some of them already condensing droplets. However, after passing through the sampling line and being dried, these enlarged particles experienced a reduction in liquid water content and particle size. As a result, the measured dry particles represent a mixture of ambient particles (or droplets) from a wider size range with various \u03ba values, thereby exhibiting a special kind of chemical inhomogeneity. 4.2. Estimating Organic Aerosol Hygroscopicity The size-resolved \u03baccn can be derived from size-resolved CCN measurements by using the D50 at various SS. Figure 6 shows the relationships between the \u03baccn and Dp at various environmental sites in China, including urban, rural, coast, and mountain sites. As can be seen, \u03baccn exhibited a positive correlation with Dp at most of those sites except for mountain site, which had a higher \u03baccn for the smaller particles. In these results, \u03baccn rapidly increased with particle size at the range of ~40 to 100 nm, whereas \u03baccn almost stays constant at Dp of 100 to 200 nm. This is consistent with previously reported results on the size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions [27], which presented a substantially varying composition within small particle size range and relatively stable compositions for larger particles.

As the ACSM is sensitive to particle mass rather than number concentration, the bulk composition is dominated by the contribution of the larger particles. Therefore, a better correlation between \u03bachem and \u03baccn was exhibited at SS of 0.1% compared with the other two SS conditions (Figures 7a and S3), suggesting the \u03baccn measured at SS = 0.1% was more suitable for closure analysis with \u03bachem derived from bulk composition.

As the ACSM is sensitive to particle mass rather than number concentration, the bulk composition is dominated by the contribution of the larger particles. Therefore, a better correlation between \u03bachem and \u03baccn was exhibited at SS of 0.1% compared with the other two SS conditions (Figures 7a and S3), suggesting the \u03baccn measured at SS = 0.1% was more suitable for closure analysis with \u03bachem derived from bulk composition.

For a speci\ufb01c SS, D50 decreased with an increase in the degree of internal mixing, implying that enhancing the internal mixing level facilitated the CCN activity. Particularly, the variation in the mixing state exhibits high sensitivity to D50 when the ratio drops from 0.5 to 0.3. This can be attributed to the increases in the internal mixing level during the aerosol aging process, leading to an enhancement in aerosol chemical homogeneity and hygroscopicity. The relationship between (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 and D50 can be well \ufb01t- ted with an exponential function under the conditions of SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. However, under the condition of SS = 0.1%, their relationship is hard to be adequately \ufb01tted. Fur- ther analysis of the relationship (SS = 0.1%) revealed that the relatively high values of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 (0.3\u20130.4) with small D50 (<165 nm) occurred under high PM2.5 concentra- tion (>60 \u00b5g m\u22123) and high RH (>60%) conditions (Figure S2), leading to the relationship deviated from satisfactory \ufb01tting by using an exponential function. Under these condi- tions, the hygroscopicity and size of aerosol particles were enlarged due to the increasing fraction of nitrate and hygroscopic growth, respectively. Especially for the fog period, the droplets had a more diverse population of \u03ba values, as separated by some of them already condensing droplets. However, after passing through the sampling line and being dried, these enlarged particles experienced a reduction in liquid water content and particle size. As a result, the measured dry particles represent a mixture of ambient particles (or droplets) from a wider size range with various \u03ba values, thereby exhibiting a special kind of chemical inhomogeneity. 4.2. Estimating Organic Aerosol Hygroscopicity The size-resolved \u03baccn can be derived from size-resolved CCN measurements by using the D50 at various SS. Figure 6 shows the relationships between the \u03baccn and Dp at various environmental sites in China, including urban, rural, coast, and mountain sites.

Then, the \u03baorg can be derived by subtracting the con-tribution of the inorganic salts (\u03bainorg) from the \u03baccn at SS = 0.1%, expressed as: \ud835\udf05(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)=\ud835\udf05(cid:2913)(cid:2913)(cid:2924)\u2212(\ud835\udf05(cid:2919)(cid:2924)(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)\ud835\udf00(cid:2919)(cid:2924)(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)+\ud835\udf05(cid:2886)(cid:2887)\ud835\udf00(cid:2886)(cid:2887))\ud835\udf00(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917) 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.0kCCN Heshan, rural, fall, 2019 (Cai et al., 2022) 15 5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 20 0.1kCCN 0.0kchem Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 11 of 15 environment [14].

For a speci\ufb01c SS, D50 decreased with an increase in the degree of internal mixing, implying that enhancing the internal mixing level facilitated the CCN activity. Particularly, the variation in the mixing state exhibits high sensitivity to D50 when the ratio drops from 0.5 to 0.3. This can be attributed to the increases in the internal mixing level during the aerosol aging process, leading to an enhancement in aerosol chemical homogeneity and hygroscopicity. The relationship between (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 and D50 can be well \ufb01t- ted with an exponential function under the conditions of SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. However, under the condition of SS = 0.1%, their relationship is hard to be adequately \ufb01tted. Fur- ther analysis of the relationship (SS = 0.1%) revealed that the relatively high values of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 (0.3\u20130.4) with small D50 (<165 nm) occurred under high PM2.5 concentra- tion (>60 \u00b5g m\u22123) and high RH (>60%) conditions (Figure S2), leading to the relationship deviated from satisfactory \ufb01tting by using an exponential function. Under these condi- tions, the hygroscopicity and size of aerosol particles were enlarged due to the increasing fraction of nitrate and hygroscopic growth, respectively. Especially for the fog period, the droplets had a more diverse population of \u03ba values, as separated by some of them already condensing droplets. However, after passing through the sampling line and being dried, these enlarged particles experienced a reduction in liquid water content and particle size. As a result, the measured dry particles represent a mixture of ambient particles (or droplets) from a wider size range with various \u03ba values, thereby exhibiting a special kind of chemical inhomogeneity. 4.2. Estimating Organic Aerosol Hygroscopicity The size-resolved \u03baccn can be derived from size-resolved CCN measurements by using the D50 at various SS. Figure 6 shows the relationships between the \u03baccn and Dp at various environmental sites in China, including urban, rural, coast, and mountain sites. As can be seen, \u03baccn exhibited a positive correlation with Dp at most of those sites except for mountain site, which had a higher \u03baccn for the smaller particles. In these results, \u03baccn rapidly increased with particle size at the range of ~40 to 100 nm, whereas \u03baccn almost stays constant at Dp of 100 to 200 nm. This is consistent with previously reported results on the size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions [27], which presented a substantially varying composition within small particle size range and relatively stable compositions for larger particles. In addition, the \u03baccn observed at urban sites were signi\ufb01cantly lower than that at rural sites, which can be attributed to the enhanced aerosol aging state from urban to rural 0Org / BC 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 200 \u03bachem (This study) kchem 50Dp (nm) Remote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 16 0.0korg 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 10 Hongkang, coast, spring, 2011 (Meng et al., 2014) (b)y = 0.005 \u00d7 x + 0.07, r = 0.96 Lin'an, rural, 2013 (Che et al., 2017) 30 y = 0.53 \u00d7 x + 0.09, r = 0.64 y = 0.82 \u00d7 x + 0.01, r = 0.93 (a) 150 Haituo mountain (1344 m), winter, 2019 (Hu et al., 2020) derived korg constant korg (0.1) 100 (5)Duplissy et al.

Fur- ther analysis of the relationship (SS = 0.1%) revealed that the relatively high values of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 (0.3\u20130.4) with small D50 (<165 nm) occurred under high PM2.5 concentra- tion (>60 \u00b5g m\u22123) and high RH (>60%) conditions (Figure S2), leading to the relationship deviated from satisfactory \ufb01tting by using an exponential function. Under these condi- tions, the hygroscopicity and size of aerosol particles were enlarged due to the increasing fraction of nitrate and hygroscopic growth, respectively. Especially for the fog period, the droplets had a more diverse population of \u03ba values, as separated by some of them already condensing droplets. However, after passing through the sampling line and being dried, these enlarged particles experienced a reduction in liquid water content and particle size. As a result, the measured dry particles represent a mixture of ambient particles (or droplets) from a wider size range with various \u03ba values, thereby exhibiting a special kind of chemical inhomogeneity. 4.2. Estimating Organic Aerosol Hygroscopicity The size-resolved \u03baccn can be derived from size-resolved CCN measurements by using the D50 at various SS. Figure 6 shows the relationships between the \u03baccn and Dp at various environmental sites in China, including urban, rural, coast, and mountain sites. As can be seen, \u03baccn exhibited a positive correlation with Dp at most of those sites except for mountain site, which had a higher \u03baccn for the smaller particles. In these results, \u03baccn rapidly increased with particle size at the range of ~40 to 100 nm, whereas \u03baccn almost stays constant at Dp of 100 to 200 nm. This is consistent with previously reported results on the size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions [27], which presented a substantially varying composition within small particle size range and relatively stable compositions for larger particles. In addition, the \u03baccn observed at urban sites were signi\ufb01cantly lower than that at rural sites, which can be attributed to the enhanced aerosol aging state from urban to rural 0Org / BC 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 200 \u03bachem (This study) kchem 50Dp (nm) Remote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 16 0.0korg 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 10 Hongkang, coast, spring, 2011 (Meng et al., 2014) (b)y = 0.005 \u00d7 x + 0.07, r = 0.96 Lin'an, rural, 2013 (Che et al., 2017) 30 y = 0.53 \u00d7 x + 0.09, r = 0.64 y = 0.82 \u00d7 x + 0.01, r = 0.93 (a) 150 Haituo mountain (1344 m), winter, 2019 (Hu et al., 2020) derived korg constant korg (0.1) 100 (5)Duplissy et al.

As the ACSM is sensitive to particle mass rather than number concentration, the bulk composition is dominated by the contribution of the larger particles. Therefore, a better correlation between \u03bachem and \u03baccn was exhibited at SS of 0.1% compared with the other two SS conditions (Figures 7a and S3), suggesting the \u03baccn measured at SS = 0.1% was more suitable for closure analysis with \u03bachem derived from bulk composition. Here, we assume the discrepancy between \u03bachem and \u03baccn was mainly induced by the utilization of constant OA hygroscopicity parameter (\u03baorg). Then, the \u03baorg can be derived by subtracting the con-tribution of the inorganic salts (\u03bainorg) from the \u03baccn at SS = 0.1%, expressed as: \ud835\udf05(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)=\ud835\udf05(cid:2913)(cid:2913)(cid:2924)\u2212(\ud835\udf05(cid:2919)(cid:2924)(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)\ud835\udf00(cid:2919)(cid:2924)(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)+\ud835\udf05(cid:2886)(cid:2887)\ud835\udf00(cid:2886)(cid:2887))\ud835\udf00(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917) 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.0kCCN Heshan, rural, fall, 2019 (Cai et al., 2022) 15 5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 20 0.1kCCN 0.0kchem Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 11 of 15 environment [14].
