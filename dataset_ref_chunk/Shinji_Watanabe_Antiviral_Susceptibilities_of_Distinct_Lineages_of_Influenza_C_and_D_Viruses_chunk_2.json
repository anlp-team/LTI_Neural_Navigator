We have been conducting global and nationwide monitoring of the baloxavir susceptibility of in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses by using a focus reduction assay in MDCK cells and humanized MDCK cells, hCK cells [15], which express high levels of \u03b12, 6-sialoglycans and very low levels of \u03b12, 3-sialoglycans [9,16]. The focus reduction assay is sensitive, robust, and less laborious than conventional cell-based assays and is highly suitable for the surveillance of antiviral susceptibility of in\ufb02uenza viruses [17]. Furthermore, we have successfully applied this assay to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells and Vero E6-TMPRSS2-T2A-ACE2 cells [18\u201322]. Here, we deter- mined the susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza C viruses representing all six lineages and in\ufb02uenza D viruses representing four lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, and D/Yama2019) to baloxavir and favipiravir by using this assay. Since in\ufb02uenza D viruses replicate well in MDCK cells and swine testicular (ST) cells [23], we applied this assay to ST cells. To our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst report describing the focus reduction assay for in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses and the antiviral susceptibilities of Japanese lineages of in\ufb02uenza D viruses D/Yama2016 and D/Yama2019. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Viruses and Cells In\ufb02uenza C viruses were propagated in MDCK cells (NBL-2, ATCC CCL-34) in Dul- becco\u2019s Modi\ufb01ed Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) supplemented with 5 \u00b5g/mL N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin 2 of 10 Viruses 2023, 15, 244 at 34 \u25e6C. In\ufb02uenza D viruses were propagated in ST cells (ATCC CRL-1746) in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA supplemented with 0.5 \u00b5g/mL TPCK-trypsin at 34 \u25e6C. The phy- logenetic analyses of the in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses used in this study were previously reported [10,24]. D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 and D/bovine/Nebraska/9-5/2012 were kindly provided by Dr. Benjamin Hause (South Dakota State University, USA). In\ufb02uenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Yamagata lineage viruses served as reference wild-type and baloxavir-resistant viruses. In\ufb02uenza A and B viruses were propa- gated in MDCK cells containing 0.2% BSA supplemented with 1 \u00b5g/mL TPCK-trypsin at 34 \u25e6C. In\ufb02uenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses possessing the PA I38T substitution were reported in our previous studies [25,26]. RG-B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (wild-type) and RG-B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (PA I38T mutant) were kindly provided by the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on In\ufb02uenza, Melbourne. 2.2. Antiviral Compounds The active form of baloxavir marboxil (baloxavir acid) and favipiravir were purchased from Funakoshi Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), respectively. Both compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. 2.3. Focus Reduction Assay Baloxavir and favipiravir susceptibilities were determined by using the focus reduction assay as previously described [16] in MDCK cells and ST cells. Since ST cells are more sensitive to TPCK-trypsin than MDCK cells, the assay conditions were modi\ufb01ed for ST cells. Brie\ufb02y, con\ufb02uent monolayers of cells in 96-well plates were infected with 1000 focus- forming units (FFU) of virus/well. Virus adsorption was carried out for 1 h at 37 \u25e6C for ef\ufb01cient binding and then an equal volume of Avicel RC-581 (2.4% in MDCK cells; 1.2% in ST cells, DuPont Nutrition USA, Wilmington, DE, USA) in culture medium containing serial dilutions of baloxavir acid (0.025\u20132500 nM) or favipiravir (0.01\u20131000 \u00b5M) supplemented with TPCK-trypsin (1.0 \u00b5g/mL for in\ufb02uenza A, B, and D viruses or 5.0 \u00b5g/mL for in\ufb02uenza C viruses in MDCK cells; 0.5 \u00b5g/mL for in\ufb02uenza A, B, C, and D viruses in ST cells) was added to each well in triplicate. The cells were incubated for 18 h at 34 \u25e6C and then \ufb01xed with formalin. After the formalin was removed, the cells were immunostained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the nucleoprotein of in\ufb02uenza A (A1 and A3, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), B (B2 and B4, Merck KGaA), C (H27) [27], and D (2A5) viruses, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (SeraCare Life Sciences, Milford, MA, USA). Since the monoclonal antibody 2A5 reacts nonspeci\ufb01cally with ST cells, a mouse monoclonal antibody against the HEF of in\ufb02uenza D virus (1E12) was used in ST cells. The infected cells were stained with TrueBlue Substrate (SeraCare Life Sciences) and then washed with distilled water. After cell drying, the focus numbers were quanti\ufb01ed by using an ImmunoSpot S6 Analyzer, ImmunoCapture software and BioSpot software (Cellular Technology, Cleveland, OH, USA). The results are expressed as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, which were calculated by using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). 2.4.

Since in\ufb02uenza D viruses replicate well in MDCK cells and swine testicular (ST) cells [23], we applied this assay to ST cells. To our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst report describing the focus reduction assay for in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses and the antiviral susceptibilities of Japanese lineages of in\ufb02uenza D viruses D/Yama2016 and D/Yama2019. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Viruses and Cells In\ufb02uenza C viruses were propagated in MDCK cells (NBL-2, ATCC CCL-34) in Dul- becco\u2019s Modi\ufb01ed Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) supplemented with 5 \u00b5g/mL N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin 2 of 10 Viruses 2023, 15, 244 at 34 \u25e6C. In\ufb02uenza D viruses were propagated in ST cells (ATCC CRL-1746) in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA supplemented with 0.5 \u00b5g/mL TPCK-trypsin at 34 \u25e6C. The phy- logenetic analyses of the in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses used in this study were previously reported [10,24]. D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 and D/bovine/Nebraska/9-5/2012 were kindly provided by Dr. Benjamin Hause (South Dakota State University, USA). In\ufb02uenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Yamagata lineage viruses served as reference wild-type and baloxavir-resistant viruses. In\ufb02uenza A and B viruses were propa- gated in MDCK cells containing 0.2% BSA supplemented with 1 \u00b5g/mL TPCK-trypsin at 34 \u25e6C. In\ufb02uenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses possessing the PA I38T substitution were reported in our previous studies [25,26]. RG-B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (wild-type) and RG-B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (PA I38T mutant) were kindly provided by the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on In\ufb02uenza, Melbourne. 2.2. Antiviral Compounds The active form of baloxavir marboxil (baloxavir acid) and favipiravir were purchased from Funakoshi Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), respectively. Both compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. 2.3. Focus Reduction Assay Baloxavir and favipiravir susceptibilities were determined by using the focus reduction assay as previously described [16] in MDCK cells and ST cells. Since ST cells are more sensitive to TPCK-trypsin than MDCK cells, the assay conditions were modi\ufb01ed for ST cells. Brie\ufb02y, con\ufb02uent monolayers of cells in 96-well plates were infected with 1000 focus- forming units (FFU) of virus/well. Virus adsorption was carried out for 1 h at 37 \u25e6C for ef\ufb01cient binding and then an equal volume of Avicel RC-581 (2.4% in MDCK cells; 1.2% in ST cells, DuPont Nutrition USA, Wilmington, DE, USA) in culture medium containing serial dilutions of baloxavir acid (0.025\u20132500 nM) or favipiravir (0.01\u20131000 \u00b5M) supplemented with TPCK-trypsin (1.0 \u00b5g/mL for in\ufb02uenza A, B, and D viruses or 5.0 \u00b5g/mL for in\ufb02uenza C viruses in MDCK cells; 0.5 \u00b5g/mL for in\ufb02uenza A, B, C, and D viruses in ST cells) was added to each well in triplicate. The cells were incubated for 18 h at 34 \u25e6C and then \ufb01xed with formalin. After the formalin was removed, the cells were immunostained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the nucleoprotein of in\ufb02uenza A (A1 and A3, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), B (B2 and B4, Merck KGaA), C (H27) [27], and D (2A5) viruses, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (SeraCare Life Sciences, Milford, MA, USA). Since the monoclonal antibody 2A5 reacts nonspeci\ufb01cally with ST cells, a mouse monoclonal antibody against the HEF of in\ufb02uenza D virus (1E12) was used in ST cells. The infected cells were stained with TrueBlue Substrate (SeraCare Life Sciences) and then washed with distilled water. After cell drying, the focus numbers were quanti\ufb01ed by using an ImmunoSpot S6 Analyzer, ImmunoCapture software and BioSpot software (Cellular Technology, Cleveland, OH, USA). The results are expressed as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, which were calculated by using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). 2.4.

In\ufb02uenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Yamagata lineage viruses served as reference wild-type and baloxavir-resistant viruses. In\ufb02uenza A and B viruses were propa- gated in MDCK cells containing 0.2% BSA supplemented with 1 \u00b5g/mL TPCK-trypsin at 34 \u25e6C. In\ufb02uenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses possessing the PA I38T substitution were reported in our previous studies [25,26]. RG-B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (wild-type) and RG-B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (PA I38T mutant) were kindly provided by the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on In\ufb02uenza, Melbourne. 2.2. Antiviral Compounds The active form of baloxavir marboxil (baloxavir acid) and favipiravir were purchased from Funakoshi Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), respectively. Both compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. 2.3. Focus Reduction Assay Baloxavir and favipiravir susceptibilities were determined by using the focus reduction assay as previously described [16] in MDCK cells and ST cells. Since ST cells are more sensitive to TPCK-trypsin than MDCK cells, the assay conditions were modi\ufb01ed for ST cells. Brie\ufb02y, con\ufb02uent monolayers of cells in 96-well plates were infected with 1000 focus- forming units (FFU) of virus/well. Virus adsorption was carried out for 1 h at 37 \u25e6C for ef\ufb01cient binding and then an equal volume of Avicel RC-581 (2.4% in MDCK cells; 1.2% in ST cells, DuPont Nutrition USA, Wilmington, DE, USA) in culture medium containing serial dilutions of baloxavir acid (0.025\u20132500 nM) or favipiravir (0.01\u20131000 \u00b5M) supplemented with TPCK-trypsin (1.0 \u00b5g/mL for in\ufb02uenza A, B, and D viruses or 5.0 \u00b5g/mL for in\ufb02uenza C viruses in MDCK cells; 0.5 \u00b5g/mL for in\ufb02uenza A, B, C, and D viruses in ST cells) was added to each well in triplicate. The cells were incubated for 18 h at 34 \u25e6C and then \ufb01xed with formalin. After the formalin was removed, the cells were immunostained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the nucleoprotein of in\ufb02uenza A (A1 and A3, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), B (B2 and B4, Merck KGaA), C (H27) [27], and D (2A5) viruses, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (SeraCare Life Sciences, Milford, MA, USA). Since the monoclonal antibody 2A5 reacts nonspeci\ufb01cally with ST cells, a mouse monoclonal antibody against the HEF of in\ufb02uenza D virus (1E12) was used in ST cells. The infected cells were stained with TrueBlue Substrate (SeraCare Life Sciences) and then washed with distilled water. After cell drying, the focus numbers were quanti\ufb01ed by using an ImmunoSpot S6 Analyzer, ImmunoCapture software and BioSpot software (Cellular Technology, Cleveland, OH, USA). The results are expressed as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, which were calculated by using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). 2.4.

We have been conducting global and nationwide monitoring of the baloxavir susceptibility of in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses by using a focus reduction assay in MDCK cells and humanized MDCK cells, hCK cells [15], which express high levels of \u03b12, 6-sialoglycans and very low levels of \u03b12, 3-sialoglycans [9,16]. The focus reduction assay is sensitive, robust, and less laborious than conventional cell-based assays and is highly suitable for the surveillance of antiviral susceptibility of in\ufb02uenza viruses [17]. Furthermore, we have successfully applied this assay to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells and Vero E6-TMPRSS2-T2A-ACE2 cells [18\u201322]. Here, we deter- mined the susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza C viruses representing all six lineages and in\ufb02uenza D viruses representing four lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, and D/Yama2019) to baloxavir and favipiravir by using this assay.

Virus adsorption was carried out for 1 h at 37 \u25e6C for ef\ufb01cient binding and then an equal volume of Avicel RC-581 (2.4% in MDCK cells; 1.2% in ST cells, DuPont Nutrition USA, Wilmington, DE, USA) in culture medium containing serial dilutions of baloxavir acid (0.025\u20132500 nM) or favipiravir (0.01\u20131000 \u00b5M) supplemented with TPCK-trypsin (1.0 \u00b5g/mL for in\ufb02uenza A, B, and D viruses or 5.0 \u00b5g/mL for in\ufb02uenza C viruses in MDCK cells; 0.5 \u00b5g/mL for in\ufb02uenza A, B, C, and D viruses in ST cells) was added to each well in triplicate. The cells were incubated for 18 h at 34 \u25e6C and then \ufb01xed with formalin. After the formalin was removed, the cells were immunostained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the nucleoprotein of in\ufb02uenza A (A1 and A3, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), B (B2 and B4, Merck KGaA), C (H27) [27], and D (2A5) viruses, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (SeraCare Life Sciences, Milford, MA, USA). Since the monoclonal antibody 2A5 reacts nonspeci\ufb01cally with ST cells, a mouse monoclonal antibody against the HEF of in\ufb02uenza D virus (1E12) was used in ST cells. The infected cells were stained with TrueBlue Substrate (SeraCare Life Sciences) and then washed with distilled water. After cell drying, the focus numbers were quanti\ufb01ed by using an ImmunoSpot S6 Analyzer, ImmunoCapture software and BioSpot software (Cellular Technology, Cleveland, OH, USA). The results are expressed as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, which were calculated by using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). 2.4.

Results We determined the susceptibilities of all six lineages (C/Taylor, C/Yamagata, C/Sao Paulo, C/Aichi, C/Kanagawa, and C/Mississippi) of in\ufb02uenza C viruses and four lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, and D/Yama2019) of in\ufb02uenza D viruses to baloxavir and favipiravir by using the focus reduction assay in MDCK cells and ST cells (Table 1 and Figure 1).

We have been conducting global and nationwide monitoring of the baloxavir susceptibility of in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses by using a focus reduction assay in MDCK cells and humanized MDCK cells, hCK cells [15], which express high levels of \u03b12, 6-sialoglycans and very low levels of \u03b12, 3-sialoglycans [9,16]. The focus reduction assay is sensitive, robust, and less laborious than conventional cell-based assays and is highly suitable for the surveillance of antiviral susceptibility of in\ufb02uenza viruses [17]. Furthermore, we have successfully applied this assay to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells and Vero E6-TMPRSS2-T2A-ACE2 cells [18\u201322]. Here, we deter- mined the susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza C viruses representing all six lineages and in\ufb02uenza D viruses representing four lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, and D/Yama2019) to baloxavir and favipiravir by using this assay. Since in\ufb02uenza D viruses replicate well in MDCK cells and swine testicular (ST) cells [23], we applied this assay to ST cells. To our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst report describing the focus reduction assay for in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses and the antiviral susceptibilities of Japanese lineages of in\ufb02uenza D viruses D/Yama2016 and D/Yama2019. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Viruses and Cells In\ufb02uenza C viruses were propagated in MDCK cells (NBL-2, ATCC CCL-34) in Dul- becco\u2019s Modi\ufb01ed Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) supplemented with 5 \u00b5g/mL N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin 2 of 10 Viruses 2023, 15, 244 at 34 \u25e6C. In\ufb02uenza D viruses were propagated in ST cells (ATCC CRL-1746) in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA supplemented with 0.5 \u00b5g/mL TPCK-trypsin at 34 \u25e6C. The phy- logenetic analyses of the in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses used in this study were previously reported [10,24]. D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 and D/bovine/Nebraska/9-5/2012 were kindly provided by Dr. Benjamin Hause (South Dakota State University, USA). In\ufb02uenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Yamagata lineage viruses served as reference wild-type and baloxavir-resistant viruses. In\ufb02uenza A and B viruses were propa- gated in MDCK cells containing 0.2% BSA supplemented with 1 \u00b5g/mL TPCK-trypsin at 34 \u25e6C. In\ufb02uenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses possessing the PA I38T substitution were reported in our previous studies [25,26]. RG-B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (wild-type) and RG-B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (PA I38T mutant) were kindly provided by the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on In\ufb02uenza, Melbourne. 2.2. Antiviral Compounds The active form of baloxavir marboxil (baloxavir acid) and favipiravir were purchased from Funakoshi Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), respectively. Both compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. 2.3. Focus Reduction Assay Baloxavir and favipiravir susceptibilities were determined by using the focus reduction assay as previously described [16] in MDCK cells and ST cells. Since ST cells are more sensitive to TPCK-trypsin than MDCK cells, the assay conditions were modi\ufb01ed for ST cells. Brie\ufb02y, con\ufb02uent monolayers of cells in 96-well plates were infected with 1000 focus- forming units (FFU) of virus/well.
