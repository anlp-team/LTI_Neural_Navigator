Contrastive Loss Analysis We analyze the effect of speci\ufb01c form of the contrastive loss function in Table 8. Recall that in Eqn. 7, our formula- tion of the contrastive loss maximizes the similarity of each pixel embedding, \u02dczp to only a prototype of the region, Uk that includes pixel p. Here, we introduce another variant of that loss, Lt+ obj(p) that maximizes the similarity of \u02dczp to pro- totypes of all valid regions, {Uk}K k=1 \\ \u2126(k) that share the same region-label. While, originially, region-labels could in\ufb02uence the loss function only via dissimilarity scores, in Lt+ obj(p), they can in\ufb02uence via both similarity and dissimi- larity scores. We observe that allowing greater region-label in\ufb02uence obj(p). Zooming in Lt+ obj(p) leads to worse mIoU than Lt into the classwise IoUs reveal that less-common classes primarily contribute the the overall worse performance of Lt+ obj(p). We suspect that increasing the in\ufb02uence of, and consequently the noise in, region-labels affect these less- common classes more adversely than common classes like road, sidewalk, wall and car. Finally, this ablation guides our decision to adopt Lt obj(p) as the default form of con- trastive loss in Eqn. 7. B.4. Importance of Region-Label Threshold An important hyperparameter of our objectness- constraint is the region-label threshold, \u03c4p. At higher val- ues of this threshold, valid object-regions are more likely to be a part of a single object and consistent with the ground- truth semantic category.

Contrastive Loss Analysis We analyze the effect of speci\ufb01c form of the contrastive loss function in Table 8. Recall that in Eqn. 7, our formula- tion of the contrastive loss maximizes the similarity of each pixel embedding, \u02dczp to only a prototype of the region, Uk that includes pixel p. Here, we introduce another variant of that loss, Lt+ obj(p) that maximizes the similarity of \u02dczp to pro- totypes of all valid regions, {Uk}K k=1 \\ \u2126(k) that share the same region-label. While, originially, region-labels could in\ufb02uence the loss function only via dissimilarity scores, in Lt+ obj(p), they can in\ufb02uence via both similarity and dissimi- larity scores. We observe that allowing greater region-label in\ufb02uence obj(p). Zooming in Lt+ obj(p) leads to worse mIoU than Lt into the classwise IoUs reveal that less-common classes primarily contribute the the overall worse performance of Lt+ obj(p). We suspect that increasing the in\ufb02uence of, and consequently the noise in, region-labels affect these less- common classes more adversely than common classes like road, sidewalk, wall and car. Finally, this ablation guides our decision to adopt Lt obj(p) as the default form of con- trastive loss in Eqn. 7. B.4.

Contrastive Loss Analysis We analyze the effect of speci\ufb01c form of the contrastive loss function in Table 8. Recall that in Eqn. 7, our formula- tion of the contrastive loss maximizes the similarity of each pixel embedding, \u02dczp to only a prototype of the region, Uk that includes pixel p. Here, we introduce another variant of that loss, Lt+ obj(p) that maximizes the similarity of \u02dczp to pro- totypes of all valid regions, {Uk}K k=1 \\ \u2126(k) that share the same region-label. While, originially, region-labels could in\ufb02uence the loss function only via dissimilarity scores, in Lt+ obj(p), they can in\ufb02uence via both similarity and dissimi- larity scores. We observe that allowing greater region-label in\ufb02uence obj(p). Zooming in Lt+ obj(p) leads to worse mIoU than Lt into the classwise IoUs reveal that less-common classes primarily contribute the the overall worse performance of Lt+ obj(p). We suspect that increasing the in\ufb02uence of, and consequently the noise in, region-labels affect these less- common classes more adversely than common classes like road, sidewalk, wall and car. Finally, this ablation guides our decision to adopt Lt obj(p) as the default form of con- trastive loss in Eqn. 7. B.4.

Contrastive Loss Analysis We analyze the effect of speci\ufb01c form of the contrastive loss function in Table 8. Recall that in Eqn. 7, our formula- tion of the contrastive loss maximizes the similarity of each pixel embedding, \u02dczp to only a prototype of the region, Uk that includes pixel p. Here, we introduce another variant of that loss, Lt+ obj(p) that maximizes the similarity of \u02dczp to pro- totypes of all valid regions, {Uk}K k=1 \\ \u2126(k) that share the same region-label. While, originially, region-labels could in\ufb02uence the loss function only via dissimilarity scores, in Lt+ obj(p), they can in\ufb02uence via both similarity and dissimi- larity scores. We observe that allowing greater region-label in\ufb02uence obj(p). Zooming in Lt+ obj(p) leads to worse mIoU than Lt into the classwise IoUs reveal that less-common classes primarily contribute the the overall worse performance of Lt+ obj(p). We suspect that increasing the in\ufb02uence of, and consequently the noise in, region-labels affect these less- common classes more adversely than common classes like road, sidewalk, wall and car. Finally, this ablation guides our decision to adopt Lt obj(p) as the default form of con- trastive loss in Eqn. 7. B.4. Importance of Region-Label Threshold An important hyperparameter of our objectness- constraint is the region-label threshold, \u03c4p. At higher val- ues of this threshold, valid object-regions are more likely to be a part of a single object and consistent with the ground- truth semantic category.
