The VIP values show that the chemical substances with the greatest contribution in the branch exudate group are: 2-ethylhexanol (1.234), ethanol (1.219), acetone (1.193), 2-hexanone (1.189), and 1-propanol (1.186); in the dried fruit group, the key substances with the greatest contribution are: (E)-2-heptenal (1.159), 5-methylfurfural (1.158), cyclohexanone (1.154), (E)-2-hexenal (1.153), and 2-acetylfuran (1.153).
