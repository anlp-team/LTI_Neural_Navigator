Conclusions The aerosol assimilation system in MERRA-2 reanalysis data has been assessed and validated by many studies using the measurements of aerosol optical properties such as AOD over a regional or global scale. However, the evaluation of MERRA-2 aerosol com-ponent products is still not conducted globally due to the scarcity of aerosol component measurements on extensive temporal and spatial scales. This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the MERRA-2 reanalysis dust and BC column concentration using the inde-pendent satellite-measured aerosol component concentration retrievals, which are not as-similated by the MERRA-2 reanalysis system. Several dust emission resource regions and the critical downwind dust-dominated regions are selected for the comparisons of mineral dust column concentration globally, as well as the conducted BC comparisons in some key regions of interest for strong BC emission. Generally, the performed analysis conducted in the key regions of interest globally highlights the agreement between MERRA-2 and GRASP/Component for the mineral dust and black carbon column concentration products, although some differences can be observed with reasonable explanations. It is critical to understand the behavior of MERRA-2 reanalysis component estimation and component retrievals derived from sat-ellite observations. The GRASP/Component and MERRA-2 reanalysis products show consistent tem-poral variation in dust column concentration over the dust emission resource regions, with the correlation coefficient varying from 0.91 to 0.80. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust prod-ucts present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 40~70% over the African dust emission resource regions (SAH and BOD). However, over Asian dust emission resource regions (MIE, TAK, and GOB), the relative differences are mostly less than 40%, even for negative values in the TAK re-gion. Over the downwind dust-dominated regions, the similar temporal variations in dust column concentration are also reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products, with the correlation coefficient varying from 0.98 to 0.84.

The GRASP/Component and MERRA-2 reanalysis products show consistent tem-poral variation in dust column concentration over the dust emission resource regions, with the correlation coefficient varying from 0.91 to 0.80.

Over the downwind dust-dominated regions, the similar temporal variations in dust column concentration are also reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products, with the correlation coefficient varying from 0.98 to 0.84.

Specifically, GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product presents the highest BC column concentration in April and May, whereas low values in the other months. The correlation coefficient of R = 0.68 together with RMSE = 0.75 mg/m2 (in Table 4) are found between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the NCR region, which could be attributed to small variabilities throughout the year. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the NCR region, the BC column concentration Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 388 18 of 22 of aerosol species. In addition, the satellite-derived GRASP/Component BC products in China had been validated by in situ measurements with a mean absolute difference of about 2.7 \u00b5m/m3, ranging from 0.09 to 7.8 \u00b5m/m3, and the relative difference of about 40%, ranging from 2.6% to 60%, respectively [41]. of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval for all months except December. The maximum absolute difference and relative difference are obtained in July (1.1 mg/m2 and 67.4%, respectively), as well as the absolute minimum di\ufb00erence of \u22120.2 mg/m2 and minimum relative di\ufb00erence of \u221213.6% are also recorded simultaneously in December (negative values indicate MERRA-2 BC column concentration are lower than GRASP/Component BC column concentration).

Conclusions The aerosol assimilation system in MERRA-2 reanalysis data has been assessed and validated by many studies using the measurements of aerosol optical properties such as AOD over a regional or global scale. However, the evaluation of MERRA-2 aerosol com-ponent products is still not conducted globally due to the scarcity of aerosol component measurements on extensive temporal and spatial scales. This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the MERRA-2 reanalysis dust and BC column concentration using the inde-pendent satellite-measured aerosol component concentration retrievals, which are not as-similated by the MERRA-2 reanalysis system. Several dust emission resource regions and the critical downwind dust-dominated regions are selected for the comparisons of mineral dust column concentration globally, as well as the conducted BC comparisons in some key regions of interest for strong BC emission. Generally, the performed analysis conducted in the key regions of interest globally highlights the agreement between MERRA-2 and GRASP/Component for the mineral dust and black carbon column concentration products, although some differences can be observed with reasonable explanations. It is critical to understand the behavior of MERRA-2 reanalysis component estimation and component retrievals derived from sat-ellite observations. The GRASP/Component and MERRA-2 reanalysis products show consistent tem-poral variation in dust column concentration over the dust emission resource regions, with the correlation coefficient varying from 0.91 to 0.80. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust prod-ucts present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 40~70% over the African dust emission resource regions (SAH and BOD). However, over Asian dust emission resource regions (MIE, TAK, and GOB), the relative differences are mostly less than 40%, even for negative values in the TAK re-gion. Over the downwind dust-dominated regions, the similar temporal variations in dust column concentration are also reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products, with the correlation coefficient varying from 0.98 to 0.84. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 20~50% over the Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 388 20 of 24 Figure 17.

However, anthropogenic BC emission in Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) inventory shows an increasing trend of 2.7% over eastern China for the period 2006\u20132014, which is a complete reversal of the trend of PKU inventory. Therefore, the models that employ CEDS inventory cannot successfully capture the practical descending tendency [30].
