SSA1020nm, SSA870nm, SSA675nm and SSA440nm gradually converged with the accumulation of pollutants, indicating that the scattering of each band was greatly increased as the pollutants accumulated. The AAE is often considered to be a key factor in determining the types of particles absorbing radiation (e.g., black carbon, organic materials or mineral dust) [82]. Specifically, the AAE of mixtures of black carbon with organic or inorganic components is <1, the AAE of the black carbon emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels is roughly equal to 1, and the AAE of black carbon and mineral dust emitted from the combustion of biomass is roughly equal to 1.1 [21]. The AAOD in all four bands (440, 675, 870 and 1020 nm) showed an increasing trend with the accumulation of pollutants, especially from February 10 to 11, when the AAOD440nm increased from 0.016 to 0.054 and the AAE increased from 0.62 to 1.21. This indicates that the dust present on 10 February (Figure 8) was an important factor in enhancing absorption by aerosols [23].

The aerosol concentration increased signi\ufb01cantly and the depolarization ratio was <0.2 during the accumulation of pollutants, indicating that this process consisted mainly of the accumulation of spherical particles.

This indicates that a dust-raising process that produced non-spherical particles occurred from 12:00 to 18:00. The receding polarization ratios were relatively low (<0.1) at all other times, indicating that a large number of water-soluble spherical particles were produced during this haze episode [21].

This suggests that the aerosol particles accumulated throughout the pollution process, whereas some coarse modal particles accumulated on 8\u20139 February.

The aerosol concentration increased signi\ufb01cantly and the depolarization ratio was <0.2 during the accumulation of pollutants, indicating that this process consisted mainly of the accumulation of spherical particles. In PE2, with the accumulation of pollutants, the height of the area with a high aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient gradually increased to about 1.0 km and the receding polariza- tion ratio of this layer was relatively large (>0.2) from 12:00 to 18:00 on 10 February. There was an updraft of 1\u20131.5 m s\u22121 below 500 m at about 12:00 on 10 February (Figure 7). This indicates that a dust-raising process that produced non-spherical particles occurred from 12:00 to 18:00. The receding polarization ratios were relatively low (<0.1) at all other times, indicating that a large number of water-soluble spherical particles were produced during this haze episode [21].

Figure 9 shows the trends of the SSA, AAOD, AAE, DARF, the volume distribution of coarse and \ufb01ne particles, and the volume spectrum distribution of aerosols throughout the pollution process. The SSA440nm was between 0.95 and 0.975 throughout the heavy pollution event, indicating that scattering aerosol particles were predominant throughout. This may be because, under high relative humidity (daily average > 65%), a large num- ber of \ufb01ne modal particles absorb moisture and grow, thus increasing the scattering of aerosols [32]. SSA1020nm, SSA870nm, SSA675nm and SSA440nm gradually converged with the accumulation of pollutants, indicating that the scattering of each band was greatly increased as the pollutants accumulated. The AAE is often considered to be a key factor in determining the types of particles absorbing radiation (e.g., black carbon, organic materials or mineral dust) [82]. Speci\ufb01cally, the AAE of mixtures of black carbon with organic or inorganic components is <1, the AAE of the black carbon emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels is roughly equal to 1, and the AAE of black carbon and mineral dust emitted from the combustion of biomass is roughly equal to 1.1 [21].

This suggests that the aerosol particles accumulated throughout the pollution process, whereas some coarse modal particles accumulated on 8\u20139 February.

This indicates that a dust-raising process that produced non-spherical particles occurred from 12:00 to 18:00. The receding polarization ratios were relatively low (<0.1) at all other times, indicating that a large number of water-soluble spherical particles were produced during this haze episode [21]. Figure 8. Spatial and temporal distribution of the extinction coef\ufb01cient (a) and depolarization ratio (b) in urban Beijing from 8 to 15 February 2020. Figure 9 shows the trends of the SSA, AAOD, AAE, DARF, the volume distribution of coarse and \ufb01ne particles, and the volume spectrum distribution of aerosols throughout the pollution process. The SSA440nm was between 0.95 and 0.975 throughout the heavy pollution event, indicating that scattering aerosol particles were predominant throughout. This may be because, under high relative humidity (daily average > 65%), a large num- ber of \ufb01ne modal particles absorb moisture and grow, thus increasing the scattering of aerosols [32]. SSA1020nm, SSA870nm, SSA675nm and SSA440nm gradually converged with the accumulation of pollutants, indicating that the scattering of each band was greatly increased as the pollutants accumulated. The AAE is often considered to be a key factor in determining the types of particles absorbing radiation (e.g., black carbon, organic materials or mineral dust) [82]. Speci\ufb01cally, the AAE of mixtures of black carbon with organic or inorganic components is <1, the AAE of the black carbon emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels is roughly equal to 1, and the AAE of black carbon and mineral dust emitted from the combustion of biomass is roughly equal to 1.1 [21].

The volume of fine modal particles increased gradually with the accumulation of pollutants and the peak concentration increased from 0.008 to 0.31 \u03bcm(cid:2871) \u03bcm(cid:2879)(cid:2870). The total volume increased from 0.01 to 0.33 \u03bcm(cid:2871), whereas the total volume of coarse modal particles increased from 0.009 to 0.061 \u03bcm(cid:2871)on 8\u20139 February, but then did not change much. This suggests that the aerosol particles accumulated throughout the pollution process, whereas some coarse modal particles accumulated on 8\u20139 February. As the volume of fine modal particles increased, their peak concentration and the radius of fine particles corresponding to the peak concentration also increased. For example, the peak concentration of fine modal particles on 10 February was 0.03 \u03bcm(cid:2871) \u03bcm(cid:2879)(cid:2870) and the radius was 0.25 \u03bcm. However, as the pollutants accumulated, by 13 February the peak concentration of fine modal particles was 0.31 \u03bcm(cid:2871) \u03bcm(cid:2879)(cid:2870) and their radius was 0.33 \u03bcm. This may be due to the accumulation of a large number of water-soluble particles (e.g., sulfate and nitrate particles) during the accumulation of pollutants. The hygroscopic growth of these particles at high relative humidity (daily average >65%) results in a gradual increase in the size of fine particles as pollutants accumulate [83]. Figure 9.
