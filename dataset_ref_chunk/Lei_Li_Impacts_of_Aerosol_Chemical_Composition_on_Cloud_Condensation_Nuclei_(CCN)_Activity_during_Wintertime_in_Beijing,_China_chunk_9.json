As is shown in Figure 7b, the \u03baorg shows a positive relationship with the concentration ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC), which can be used to re\ufb02ect the contribution of SOA to total OA [60,61]. Several previous studies suggested \u03baorg as a function of the f 44 or O:C [54,55]; however, \u03baorg was not correlated to the f 44 during the observation periods of this study. This is similar to a recent study conducted by Kuang et al. (2021), which pointed out that \u03baorg was weakly correlated with O:C, but well correlated with the sum mass fraction of aged biomass burning OA and more oxygenated OA in total OA [23]. In order to parame- terize the relationship between \u03baorg and Org/BC ratios, \u03baorg values were binned by Org/BC in increments of 5. Then, a power \ufb01tting function \u03baorg = 0.05\u00d7(Org/BC)0.42 was obtained. This \ufb01tting function was adopted to reconstruct the hygroscopicity parameter (\u03bachem_new). As is shown in Figure 7a, a better correlation between \u03bachem and \u03baccn was achieved after using the parameterized \u03baorg instead of constant value (0.1), indicating suitable \u03baorg scheme play an important role in deriving \u03bachem from aerosol chemical composition. 5. Conclusions The in situ measurements of CCN activity at ground level can be applied to opti- mize the parameters of retrieving cloud microphysics with remote sensing data. Notable reductions in PM2.5 concentration over the past decade have been accompanied by sig- ni\ufb01cant changes in its chemical composition in the North China Plain. Therefore, more investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN activity. In this study, aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and CCN number concentration were measured concurrently to investigate the size-resolved CCN activity during wintertime 2022 in Beijing, China. The critical activation dimeter D50 derived from size-resolved activation ratio can be negatively associated with CCN activity. During the observation period, the average CCN concentrations at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were 1340 cm\u22123, 2750 cm\u22123, and 3270 cm\u22123, corresponding to the"}, {"question": " Why was a better correlation between \u03bachem and \u03baccn observed at SS of 0.1%?", "answer": " The bulk composition is dominated by the contribution of the larger particles at SS of 0.1%.", "ref_chunk": "[30] for Cai et al. 2022, Ref.

As is shown in Figure 7b, the \u03baorg shows a positive relationship with the concentration ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC), which can be used to re\ufb02ect the contribution of SOA to total OA [60,61]. Several previous studies suggested \u03baorg as a function of the f 44 or O:C [54,55]; however, \u03baorg was not correlated to the f 44 during the observation periods of this study. This is similar to a recent study conducted by Kuang et al. (2021), which pointed out that \u03baorg was weakly correlated with O:C, but well correlated with the sum mass fraction of aged biomass burning OA and more oxygenated OA in total OA [23]. In order to parame- terize the relationship between \u03baorg and Org/BC ratios, \u03baorg values were binned by Org/BC in increments of 5. Then, a power \ufb01tting function \u03baorg = 0.05\u00d7(Org/BC)0.42 was obtained. This \ufb01tting function was adopted to reconstruct the hygroscopicity parameter (\u03bachem_new). As is shown in Figure 7a, a better correlation between \u03bachem and \u03baccn was achieved after using the parameterized \u03baorg instead of constant value (0.1), indicating suitable \u03baorg scheme play an important role in deriving \u03bachem from aerosol chemical composition. 5. Conclusions The in situ measurements of CCN activity at ground level can be applied to opti- mize the parameters of retrieving cloud microphysics with remote sensing data. Notable reductions in PM2.5 concentration over the past decade have been accompanied by sig- ni\ufb01cant changes in its chemical composition in the North China Plain. Therefore, more investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN activity. In this study, aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and CCN number concentration were measured concurrently to investigate the size-resolved CCN activity during wintertime 2022 in Beijing, China. The critical activation dimeter D50 derived from size-resolved activation ratio can be negatively associated with CCN activity. During the observation period, the average CCN concentrations at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were 1340 cm\u22123, 2750 cm\u22123, and 3270 cm\u22123, corresponding to the"}, {"question": " What was the average CCN concentration at SS = 0.1% during the observation period?", "answer": " 1340 cm\u22123", "ref_chunk": "[30] for Cai et al. 2022, Ref.

Here, we assume the discrepancy between \u03bachem and \u03baccn was mainly induced by the utilization of constant OA hygroscopicity parameter (\u03baorg). Then, the \u03baorg can be derived by subtracting the con-tribution of the inorganic salts (\u03bainorg) from the \u03baccn at SS = 0.1%, expressed as: \ud835\udf05(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)=\ud835\udf05(cid:2913)(cid:2913)(cid:2924)\u2212(\ud835\udf05(cid:2919)(cid:2924)(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)\ud835\udf00(cid:2919)(cid:2924)(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917)+\ud835\udf05(cid:2886)(cid:2887)\ud835\udf00(cid:2886)(cid:2887))\ud835\udf00(cid:2925)(cid:2928)(cid:2917) 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.0kCCN Heshan, rural, fall, 2019 (Cai et al., 2022) 15 5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 20 0.1kCCN 0.0kchem \u03baccn \u2212 (cid:0)\u03bainorg\u03b5inorg + \u03baBC\u03b5BC \u03b5org (cid:1) \u03baorg = (5) Figure 7.

(2011) pointed out that the uncertainty in the estimation of \u03baorg de- creases with increasing organic fraction; thereby, only data featuring organic fractions larger than 50% were used in this calculation [17]. As is shown in Figure 7b, the \u03baorg shows a positive relationship with the concentration ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC), which can be used to re\ufb02ect the contribution of SOA to total OA [60,61]. Several previous studies suggested \u03baorg as a function of the f 44 or O:C [54,55]; however, \u03baorg was not correlated to the f 44 during the observation periods of this study. This is similar to a recent study conducted by Kuang et al. (2021), which pointed out that \u03baorg was weakly correlated with O:C, but well correlated with the sum mass fraction of aged biomass burning OA and more oxygenated OA in total OA [23]. In order to parame- terize the relationship between \u03baorg and Org/BC ratios, \u03baorg values were binned by Org/BC in increments of 5. Then, a power \ufb01tting function \u03baorg = 0.05\u00d7(Org/BC)0.42 was obtained. This \ufb01tting function was adopted to reconstruct the hygroscopicity parameter (\u03bachem_new). As is shown in Figure 7a, a better correlation between \u03bachem and \u03baccn was achieved after using the parameterized \u03baorg instead of constant value (0.1), indicating suitable \u03baorg scheme play an important role in deriving \u03bachem from aerosol chemical composition. 5. Conclusions The in situ measurements of CCN activity at ground level can be applied to opti- mize the parameters of retrieving cloud microphysics with remote sensing data. Notable reductions in PM2.5 concentration over the past decade have been accompanied by sig- ni\ufb01cant changes in its chemical composition in the North China Plain. Therefore, more investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN activity. In this study, aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and CCN number concentration were measured concurrently to investigate the size-resolved CCN activity during wintertime 2022 in Beijing, China. The critical activation dimeter D50 derived from size-resolved activation ratio can be negatively associated with CCN activity. During the observation period, the average CCN concentrations at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were 1340 cm\u22123, 2750 cm\u22123, and 3270 cm\u22123, corresponding to the"}, {"question": " What role did suitable \u03baorg scheme play in the study?", "answer": " Suitable \u03baorg scheme played an important role in deriving \u03bachem from aerosol chemical composition.", "ref_chunk": "[30] for Cai et al. 2022, Ref.

As is shown in Figure 7b, the \u03baorg shows a positive relationship with the concentration ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC), which can be used to re\ufb02ect the contribution of SOA to total OA [60,61]. Several previous studies suggested \u03baorg as a function of the f 44 or O:C [54,55]; however, \u03baorg was not correlated to the f 44 during the observation periods of this study. This is similar to a recent study conducted by Kuang et al. (2021), which pointed out that \u03baorg was weakly correlated with O:C, but well correlated with the sum mass fraction of aged biomass burning OA and more oxygenated OA in total OA [23]. In order to parame- terize the relationship between \u03baorg and Org/BC ratios, \u03baorg values were binned by Org/BC in increments of 5. Then, a power \ufb01tting function \u03baorg = 0.05\u00d7(Org/BC)0.42 was obtained. This \ufb01tting function was adopted to reconstruct the hygroscopicity parameter (\u03bachem_new). As is shown in Figure 7a, a better correlation between \u03bachem and \u03baccn was achieved after using the parameterized \u03baorg instead of constant value (0.1), indicating suitable \u03baorg scheme play an important role in deriving \u03bachem from aerosol chemical composition. 5. Conclusions The in situ measurements of CCN activity at ground level can be applied to opti- mize the parameters of retrieving cloud microphysics with remote sensing data. Notable reductions in PM2.5 concentration over the past decade have been accompanied by sig- ni\ufb01cant changes in its chemical composition in the North China Plain. Therefore, more investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN activity. In this study, aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and CCN number concentration were measured concurrently to investigate the size-resolved CCN activity during wintertime 2022 in Beijing, China. The critical activation dimeter D50 derived from size-resolved activation ratio can be negatively associated with CCN activity. During the observation period, the average CCN concentrations at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were 1340 cm\u22123, 2750 cm\u22123, and 3270 cm\u22123, corresponding to the"}], "doc_text": "[30] for Cai et al. 2022, Ref.

As the ACSM is sensitive to particle mass rather than number concentration, the bulk composition is dominated by the contribution of the larger particles. Therefore, a better correlation between \u03bachem and \u03baccn was exhibited at SS of 0.1% compared with the other two SS conditions (Figures 7a and S3), suggesting the \u03baccn measured at SS = 0.1% was more suitable for closure analysis with \u03bachem derived from bulk composition. Here, we assume the discrepancy between \u03bachem and \u03baccn was mainly induced by the utilization of constant OA hygroscopicity parameter (\u03baorg).
