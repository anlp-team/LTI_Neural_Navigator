Same as Figure 3, but for Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression (BOD) region. 3.1.3. Middle East The dust concentration over the Middle East (MIE) region also presents significant interannual variation. The differences in column dust concentration between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product over MIE are shown in Figure 5. On a regional means, the temporal variations represented by GRASP/Compo-nent dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product are in very good agreement. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in May, June, and July, whereas low values in November, December, and January. The statistics in the comparisons are also investi-gated for the regional dust column concentration. A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.90) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the MIE region with RMSE = 134.43 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is worth mentioning that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 5. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the MIE region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in August (209.7 mg/m2) and the relative difference in November (55.9%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in February (54.0 mg/m2) and the relative difference in May (18.0%). We should point out that the highest dust column concentration in the MIE region was retrieved in 2012 (Figure 5), which is consistent with the findings that the maximum values of AOD observed in 2012 over the MIE region using MODIS products during the period 2000 to 2015 [5]. The meteorological parameters of sea level pressure and wind speed representing the influences of synoptic systems on dust concentration make contributions to aerosol loading in the MIE region. The variation in dust column concentration in the Arabian Peninsula is intensely associ-ated with the Shamal winds, the magnitude of precipitation, the tropical Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea temperatures [51]. The accuracy of meteorological parameters estimation in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system could partly affect the differences.

The differences in column dust concentration between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product over MIE are shown in Figure 5. On a regional means, the temporal variations represented by GRASP/Compo-nent dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product are in very good agreement. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in May, June, and July, whereas low values in November, December, and January. The statistics in the comparisons are also investi-gated for the regional dust column concentration. A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.90) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the MIE region with RMSE = 134.43 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is worth mentioning that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 5. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the MIE region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in August (209.7 mg/m2) and the relative difference in November (55.9%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in February (54.0 mg/m2) and the relative difference in May (18.0%). We should point out that the highest dust column concentration in the MIE region was retrieved in 2012 (Figure 5), which is consistent with the findings that the maximum values of AOD observed in 2012 over the MIE region using MODIS products during the period 2000 to 2015 [5]. The meteorological parameters of sea level pressure and wind speed representing the influences of synoptic systems on dust concentration make contributions to aerosol loading in the MIE region. The variation in dust column concentration in the Arabian Peninsula is intensely associ-ated with the Shamal winds, the magnitude of precipitation, the tropical Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea temperatures [51]. The accuracy of meteorological parameters estimation in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system could partly affect the differences.

We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the MIE region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in August (209.7 mg/m2) and the relative difference in November (55.9%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in February (54.0 mg/m2) and the relative difference in May (18.0%). We should point out that the highest dust column concentration in the MIE region was retrieved in 2012 (Figure 5), which is consistent with the findings that the maximum values of AOD observed in 2012 over the MIE region using MODIS products during the period 2000 to 2015 [5]. The meteorological parameters of sea level pressure and wind speed representing the influences of synoptic systems on dust concentration make contributions to aerosol loading in the MIE region. The variation in dust column concentration in the Arabian Peninsula is intensely associ-ated with the Shamal winds, the magnitude of precipitation, the tropical Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea temperatures [51]. The accuracy of meteorological parameters estimation in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system could partly affect the differences.

A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.90) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the MIE region with RMSE = 134.43 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is worth mentioning that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 5. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3.

Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in May, June, and July, whereas low values in November, December, and January. The statistics in the comparisons are also investi-gated for the regional dust column concentration. A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.90) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the MIE region with RMSE = 134.43 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is worth mentioning that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 5. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the MIE region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in August (209.7 mg/m2) and the relative difference in November (55.9%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in February (54.0 mg/m2) and the relative difference in May (18.0%). We should point out that the highest dust column concentration in the MIE region was retrieved in 2012 (Figure 5), which is consistent with the findings that the maximum values of AOD observed in 2012 over the MIE region using MODIS products during the period 2000 to 2015 [5]. The meteorological parameters of sea level pressure and wind speed representing the influences of synoptic systems on dust concentration make contributions to aerosol loading in the MIE region. The variation in dust column concentration in the Arabian Peninsula is intensely associ-ated with the Shamal winds, the magnitude of precipitation, the tropical Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea temperatures [51]. The accuracy of meteorological parameters estimation in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system could partly affect the differences.
