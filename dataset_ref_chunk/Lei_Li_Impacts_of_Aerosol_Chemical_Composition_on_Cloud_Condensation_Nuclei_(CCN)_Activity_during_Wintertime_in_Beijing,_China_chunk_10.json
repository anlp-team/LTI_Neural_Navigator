The impacts of aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and mixing state on CCN activity were investigated. The results show that photochemical oxidation on a daily basis played an important role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity. Conversely, the local emissions (such as traf\ufb01c and cooking) signi\ufb01cantly enhanced D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had few in\ufb02uences on D50 at SS = 0.1% due to the limitations of particle size from emission sources. As PM2.5 concentration increases, the dominant driver of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. For carbonaceous components, both the fractions of organics and BC showed a positive correlation with D50 due to their weak hygroscopicity. The mixing state of particles was also estimated based on the size-resolved AR curve \ufb01tting. At a speci\ufb01c SS, D50 decreased with increasing the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal-mixing degree resulting from atmospheric aging facilitated to the enhancement of CCN activity. Aerosol hygroscopicity parameter \u03baccn derived from the SMCA method was size- dependent, varying from 0.26 to 0.34 as Dp increased from 84 to 172 nm. Based on the bulk aerosol chemical composition measured by the ACSM, the \u03bachem values were calculated using the ZSR method. The OA hygroscopicity \u03baorg was estimated by the closure analysis between \u03bachem and \u03baccn. However, the commonly used f 44 (or O:C) was weakly correlated with \u03baorg and failed to describe the variations in \u03baorg during the observation periods of this study. Instead, the variations in \u03baorg can be well parameterized using the Org/BC ratio, which is usually used as a tracer for the contribution of SOA to total OA. The parameterization of \u03baorg substantially improved the correlation between \u03bachem and \u03baccn, emphasizing the importance of considering \u03baorg variations when deriving \u03bachem from aerosol chemical composition. 12 of 15 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/rs15174119/s1, Figure S1: Calculation of critical activation diameter (D50) for ambient aerosols; Figure S2: Correlation between the ratio of (D75\u2212D25)/D50 and D50 at SS = 0.1%; Figure S3: Correlations between \u03bachem and \u03baccn at SS of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.

The impacts of aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and mixing state on CCN activity were investigated. The results show that photochemical oxidation on a daily basis played an important role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity. Conversely, the local emissions (such as traf\ufb01c and cooking) signi\ufb01cantly enhanced D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had few in\ufb02uences on D50 at SS = 0.1% due to the limitations of particle size from emission sources. As PM2.5 concentration increases, the dominant driver of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. For carbonaceous components, both the fractions of organics and BC showed a positive correlation with D50 due to their weak hygroscopicity. The mixing state of particles was also estimated based on the size-resolved AR curve \ufb01tting. At a speci\ufb01c SS, D50 decreased with increasing the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal-mixing degree resulting from atmospheric aging facilitated to the enhancement of CCN activity.

Based on the bulk aerosol chemical composition measured by the ACSM, the \u03bachem values were calculated using the ZSR method.

The impacts of aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and mixing state on CCN activity were investigated. The results show that photochemical oxidation on a daily basis played an important role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity. Conversely, the local emissions (such as traf\ufb01c and cooking) signi\ufb01cantly enhanced D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had few in\ufb02uences on D50 at SS = 0.1% due to the limitations of particle size from emission sources. As PM2.5 concentration increases, the dominant driver of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. For carbonaceous components, both the fractions of organics and BC showed a positive correlation with D50 due to their weak hygroscopicity. The mixing state of particles was also estimated based on the size-resolved AR curve \ufb01tting. At a speci\ufb01c SS, D50 decreased with increasing the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal-mixing degree resulting from atmospheric aging facilitated to the enhancement of CCN activity. Aerosol hygroscopicity parameter \u03baccn derived from the SMCA method was size- dependent, varying from 0.26 to 0.34 as Dp increased from 84 to 172 nm. Based on the bulk aerosol chemical composition measured by the ACSM, the \u03bachem values were calculated using the ZSR method. The OA hygroscopicity \u03baorg was estimated by the closure analysis between \u03bachem and \u03baccn. However, the commonly used f 44 (or O:C) was weakly correlated with \u03baorg and failed to describe the variations in \u03baorg during the observation periods of this study. Instead, the variations in \u03baorg can be well parameterized using the Org/BC ratio, which is usually used as a tracer for the contribution of SOA to total OA. The parameterization of \u03baorg substantially improved the correlation between \u03bachem and \u03baccn, emphasizing the importance of considering \u03baorg variations when deriving \u03bachem from aerosol chemical composition. 12 of 15 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/rs15174119/s1, Figure S1: Calculation of critical activation diameter (D50) for ambient aerosols; Figure S2: Correlation between the ratio of (D75\u2212D25)/D50 and D50 at SS = 0.1%; Figure S3: Correlations between \u03bachem and \u03baccn at SS of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.

The impacts of aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and mixing state on CCN activity were investigated. The results show that photochemical oxidation on a daily basis played an important role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity. Conversely, the local emissions (such as traf\ufb01c and cooking) signi\ufb01cantly enhanced D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had few in\ufb02uences on D50 at SS = 0.1% due to the limitations of particle size from emission sources. As PM2.5 concentration increases, the dominant driver of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. For carbonaceous components, both the fractions of organics and BC showed a positive correlation with D50 due to their weak hygroscopicity. The mixing state of particles was also estimated based on the size-resolved AR curve \ufb01tting. At a speci\ufb01c SS, D50 decreased with increasing the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal-mixing degree resulting from atmospheric aging facilitated to the enhancement of CCN activity. Aerosol hygroscopicity parameter \u03baccn derived from the SMCA method was size- dependent, varying from 0.26 to 0.34 as Dp increased from 84 to 172 nm. Based on the bulk aerosol chemical composition measured by the ACSM, the \u03bachem values were calculated using the ZSR method. The OA hygroscopicity \u03baorg was estimated by the closure analysis between \u03bachem and \u03baccn. However, the commonly used f 44 (or O:C) was weakly correlated with \u03baorg and failed to describe the variations in \u03baorg during the observation periods of this study. Instead, the variations in \u03baorg can be well parameterized using the Org/BC ratio, which is usually used as a tracer for the contribution of SOA to total OA. The parameterization of \u03baorg substantially improved the correlation between \u03bachem and \u03baccn, emphasizing the importance of considering \u03baorg variations when deriving \u03bachem from aerosol chemical composition. 12 of 15 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/rs15174119/s1, Figure S1: Calculation of critical activation diameter (D50) for ambient aerosols; Figure S2: Correlation between the ratio of (D75\u2212D25)/D50 and D50 at SS = 0.1%; Figure S3: Correlations between \u03bachem and \u03baccn at SS of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.
