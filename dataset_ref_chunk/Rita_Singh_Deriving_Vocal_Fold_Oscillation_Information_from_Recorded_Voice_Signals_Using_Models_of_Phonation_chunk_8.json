Experimental Results and Interpretation Unfortunately, until the time of writing this paper, we could not obtain actual elec- troglottographic measurements or video data of vocal fold motion to compare our derived VFOs to. However, from a computational perspective the algorithms proposed can still be validated in different ways. We explain these below. 5.1. Validation 1 Our \ufb01rst validation approach is to use the proxy of showing that the solutions ob- tained are indeed discriminative of \ufb01ne-level changes in glottal \ufb02ow dynamics of the phonation process. Having recovered the model parameters by our backward or forward approach, we can solve the models to obtain the time-series corresponding to the oscillations of each vocal fold, as estimated from recorded speech samples. We note that the models we have discussed in this paper are essentially dynamical systems represented by coupled nonlinear equations that may not have closed-form solutions, but can be numerically solved. To interpret these in discriminative settings, we can utilize some well-established methods for characterizing dynamical systems, borrowing them from chaos theory and other areas of applied mathematics (e.g., \ufb02ow, orbit, attractor, stability, Poincar\u00e9 map, bifurcation, Lyapunov exponents, etc.). These are described in Appendix F. Interpreting a System\u2019s Phase Portraits Using Its Bifurcation Map Appendix F describes the concepts and tools used to study the behaviors (e.g., \ufb02ow, orbit, attractor, stability, Poincar\u00e9 map, bifurcation) of nonlinear dynamical systems such as Equation (3). The phase space of the system in Equation (3) (representing vocal fold motion) is four-dimensional and includes states (\u03ber, \u02d9\u03ber, \u03bel, \u02d9\u03bel). For this nonlinear system, it is expected that attractors such as limit cycles or toruses will appear in the phase space. Such phenomena are consequences of speci\ufb01c parameter settings. Speci\ufb01cally, the parameter \u03b2 determines the periodicity of oscillations; the param- eter \u03b1 and \u2206 quantify the asymmetry of the displacement of left and right vocal folds and the degree to which one of the vocal folds is out of phase with the other [24,37]. We can visualize them by plotting the left and right displacements and the phase space portrait. The coupling of right and left oscillators is described by their entrainment; they are in n:m entrainment if their phases \u03b8r, \u03b8l satisfy |n\u03b8r \u2212 m\u03b8l| < C where n, m are integers, and C is a constant [24]. Such entrainment can be revealed by the Poincar\u00e9 map, where the number of trajectory crossings of the right or left oscillators within the Poincar\u00e9 section indicates the periodicity of its limit cycles. Therefore, their ratio represents the entrainment. We can use the bifurcation diagram to visualize how the entrainment changes with parameters. An example of such a bifurcation diagram is shown in Figure 5 [15,37]. As we will see later (and as indicated in Figure 5), model parameters can characterize voice pathologies, and these can be visually evident in in phase portraits and bifurca- tion plots. We use the backward algorithm to estimate the asymmetric model parameters for clinically acquired pathological speech data. The data comprise speech samples collected from subjects suffering from three different vocal pathologies. Our goal is to demonstrate that the individualized phase space trajectories of the asymmetric vocal fold model are discriminative of these disorders. The data used in our experiments is the FEMH database [38]. It comprises 200 record- ings of the sustained vowel /a:/. The data were obtained from a voice clinic in a tertiary teaching hospital, and the complete database includes 50 normal voice samples (control set) and 150 samples that represent common voice pathologies. Speci\ufb01cally, the set contains 40/60/50 samples for glottis neoplasm, phonotrauma (including vocal nodules, polyps, and cysts), and unilateral vocal paralysis, respectively. 15 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 (a) (b) Figure 5.

Experimental Results and Interpretation Unfortunately, until the time of writing this paper, we could not obtain actual elec- troglottographic measurements or video data of vocal fold motion to compare our derived VFOs to. However, from a computational perspective the algorithms proposed can still be validated in different ways. We explain these below. 5.1. Validation 1 Our \ufb01rst validation approach is to use the proxy of showing that the solutions ob- tained are indeed discriminative of \ufb01ne-level changes in glottal \ufb02ow dynamics of the phonation process. Having recovered the model parameters by our backward or forward approach, we can solve the models to obtain the time-series corresponding to the oscillations of each vocal fold, as estimated from recorded speech samples. We note that the models we have discussed in this paper are essentially dynamical systems represented by coupled nonlinear equations that may not have closed-form solutions, but can be numerically solved. To interpret these in discriminative settings, we can utilize some well-established methods for characterizing dynamical systems, borrowing them from chaos theory and other areas of applied mathematics (e.g., \ufb02ow, orbit, attractor, stability, Poincar\u00e9 map, bifurcation, Lyapunov exponents, etc.). These are described in Appendix F. Interpreting a System\u2019s Phase Portraits Using Its Bifurcation Map Appendix F describes the concepts and tools used to study the behaviors (e.g., \ufb02ow, orbit, attractor, stability, Poincar\u00e9 map, bifurcation) of nonlinear dynamical systems such as Equation (3). The phase space of the system in Equation (3) (representing vocal fold motion) is four-dimensional and includes states (\u03ber, \u02d9\u03ber, \u03bel, \u02d9\u03bel). For this nonlinear system, it is expected that attractors such as limit cycles or toruses will appear in the phase space. Such phenomena are consequences of speci\ufb01c parameter settings. Speci\ufb01cally, the parameter \u03b2 determines the periodicity of oscillations; the param- eter \u03b1 and \u2206 quantify the asymmetry of the displacement of left and right vocal folds and the degree to which one of the vocal folds is out of phase with the other [24,37]. We can visualize them by plotting the left and right displacements and the phase space portrait. The coupling of right and left oscillators is described by their entrainment; they are in n:m entrainment if their phases \u03b8r, \u03b8l satisfy |n\u03b8r \u2212 m\u03b8l| < C where n, m are integers, and C is a constant [24]. Such entrainment can be revealed by the Poincar\u00e9 map, where the number of trajectory crossings of the right or left oscillators within the Poincar\u00e9 section indicates the periodicity of its limit cycles. Therefore, their ratio represents the entrainment. We can use the bifurcation diagram to visualize how the entrainment changes with parameters. An example of such a bifurcation diagram is shown in Figure 5 [15,37]. As we will see later (and as indicated in Figure 5), model parameters can characterize voice pathologies, and these can be visually evident in in phase portraits and bifurca- tion plots. We use the backward algorithm to estimate the asymmetric model parameters for clinically acquired pathological speech data. The data comprise speech samples collected from subjects suffering from three different vocal pathologies. Our goal is to demonstrate that the individualized phase space trajectories of the asymmetric vocal fold model are discriminative of these disorders. The data used in our experiments is the FEMH database [38]. It comprises 200 record- ings of the sustained vowel /a:/. The data were obtained from a voice clinic in a tertiary teaching hospital, and the complete database includes 50 normal voice samples (control set) and 150 samples that represent common voice pathologies. Speci\ufb01cally, the set contains 40/60/50 samples for glottis neoplasm, phonotrauma (including vocal nodules, polyps, and cysts), and unilateral vocal paralysis, respectively. 15 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 (a) (b) Figure 5.

For this nonlinear system, it is expected that attractors such as limit cycles or toruses will appear in the phase space. Such phenomena are consequences of speci\ufb01c parameter settings. Speci\ufb01cally, the parameter \u03b2 determines the periodicity of oscillations; the param- eter \u03b1 and \u2206 quantify the asymmetry of the displacement of left and right vocal folds and the degree to which one of the vocal folds is out of phase with the other [24,37]. We can visualize them by plotting the left and right displacements and the phase space portrait. The coupling of right and left oscillators is described by their entrainment; they are in n:m entrainment if their phases \u03b8r, \u03b8l satisfy |n\u03b8r \u2212 m\u03b8l| < C where n, m are integers, and C is a constant [24]. Such entrainment can be revealed by the Poincar\u00e9 map, where the number of trajectory crossings of the right or left oscillators within the Poincar\u00e9 section indicates the periodicity of its limit cycles. Therefore, their ratio represents the entrainment. We can use the bifurcation diagram to visualize how the entrainment changes with parameters. An example of such a bifurcation diagram is shown in Figure 5 [15,37]. As we will see later (and as indicated in Figure 5), model parameters can characterize voice pathologies, and these can be visually evident in in phase portraits and bifurca- tion plots. We use the backward algorithm to estimate the asymmetric model parameters for clinically acquired pathological speech data. The data comprise speech samples collected from subjects suffering from three different vocal pathologies. Our goal is to demonstrate that the individualized phase space trajectories of the asymmetric vocal fold model are discriminative of these disorders. The data used in our experiments is the FEMH database [38]. It comprises 200 record- ings of the sustained vowel /a:/. The data were obtained from a voice clinic in a tertiary teaching hospital, and the complete database includes 50 normal voice samples (control set) and 150 samples that represent common voice pathologies. Speci\ufb01cally, the set contains 40/60/50 samples for glottis neoplasm, phonotrauma (including vocal nodules, polyps, and cysts), and unilateral vocal paralysis, respectively. 15 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 (a) (b) Figure 5. (a) A 3D Bifurcation diagram of the asymmetric vocal fold model. The third dimension is perpendicular to the parameter plane shown, and depicts the entrainment ratio n : m (encoded in different shades of gray) as a function of model parameters \u03b1 and \u2206, where n and m are the number of intersections of the orbits of right and left oscillators across the Poincar\u00e9 section \u02d9\u03ber,l = 0 at stable status.

The horizontal axis is displacement of a vocal fold, and the vertical axis is its velocity. Figure 6 shows some phase portraits showing the coupling of the right and left vocal folds obtained using the ADLES solution. We observe that the attractor behaviors are typical and even visually differentiable for different types of pathologies. Table 1 shows the results of deducing voice pathologies by simple thresholding of parameter ranges. Speci\ufb01cally, the ranges of model parameters in each row of Table 1 correspond to regions in the bifurcation diagram in Figure 5.

Experimental Results and Interpretation Unfortunately, until the time of writing this paper, we could not obtain actual elec- troglottographic measurements or video data of vocal fold motion to compare our derived VFOs to. However, from a computational perspective the algorithms proposed can still be validated in different ways. We explain these below. 5.1. Validation 1 Our \ufb01rst validation approach is to use the proxy of showing that the solutions ob- tained are indeed discriminative of \ufb01ne-level changes in glottal \ufb02ow dynamics of the phonation process. Having recovered the model parameters by our backward or forward approach, we can solve the models to obtain the time-series corresponding to the oscillations of each vocal fold, as estimated from recorded speech samples. We note that the models we have discussed in this paper are essentially dynamical systems represented by coupled nonlinear equations that may not have closed-form solutions, but can be numerically solved. To interpret these in discriminative settings, we can utilize some well-established methods for characterizing dynamical systems, borrowing them from chaos theory and other areas of applied mathematics (e.g., \ufb02ow, orbit, attractor, stability, Poincar\u00e9 map, bifurcation, Lyapunov exponents, etc.).
