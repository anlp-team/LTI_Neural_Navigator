In this study %GCVs for B lineage viruses were more than double compared to %GCVs for in\ufb02uenza A viruses. Participants of this EQA reported that despite careful balancing of B lineage viruses during HAIs, run-run differences in HAI titres were high. It is possible that batch-batch variations in TRBCs have a greater impact on B viruses due to differences in receptor binding af\ufb01nities between in\ufb02uenza A and B strains. B viruses are known to undergo egg adaptation, augmenting binding to avian sialic acid residues (7), however there is evidence that egg adaptation in B viruses contrasts to that seen in in\ufb02uenza A viruses, in that adaptation may involve multiple viral factors resulting in an increased ability to bind a2,3 receptors in eggs without losing the avidity for human receptors (8). Studies additionally indicate that the steric con\ufb01guration of asialyl sugars of the receptor analogue may have a greater impact on binding avidity of B in\ufb02uenza viruses than the analogue being an a2,3 or a2,6 linked sialyl-glycan (8, 9). It is possible that subtle differences in asialyl sugar con\ufb01guration between TRBC batches, and/or mutations during egg adaptation may have a greater impact on in\ufb02uenza B virus HA binding compared to in\ufb02uenza A viruses, although this remains to be seen.

The overall HAI %GCVs observed in this study for H1N1 (69%) and H3N2 (57%) are in line with or lower than previous studies (10\u201314). For HAI, the use of a consensus protocol alone (without standardized reagents) did not show a statistically signi\ufb01cant difference for the 6 laboratories that tested FLUCOP and in-house protocols side by side. Although this study was not initially designed to compare FLUCOP and in-house methods, our analysis shows agreement with previous studies that demonstrate a stricker level of harmonization than protocol sharing is required to be effective in reducing inter-laboratory variability (2, 15). It was clear that the use of a pool of serum as a study standard was effective in reducing inter-laboratory variation, again consistent with published studies (2, 10, 13, 15). This adds to the growing body of evidence in favor of developing seasonal in\ufb02uenza serology standards. MN assays had intrinsically higher levels of variability within a run (re\ufb02ected by 8.2% of coded duplicates failing in MN testing compared to 1.8% for HAI) but run to run variation was lower (4.8% of data are excluded from MN analysis due to high between-run variability compared to 11% of data for HAI). Much of the excluded data for HAI comes from strain speci\ufb01c dif\ufb01culties in balancing viruses between runs (particularly for B strains), skewing the data slightly. The considerably higher levels of inter-laboratory %GCV seen for MN assays (range of 133%-230%) likely re\ufb02ect the higher diversity in protocols for MN assays, with multiple readout methods. Other studies agree that MN assays have higher inter-laboratory variation than HAI (10, 13, 14). In comparison to previous studies, the %GCV observed for absolute titres in this EQA is consistent, with values in the hundreds \u2013 in fact %GCVs for MN assays have previously been reported with higher values than seen here: H3N2%GCVs in the range of 256-359 (14), H1N1%GCVs in the range of 204-383 (13) and H5N1%GCVs in the range of 112-185 (10). In each of these studies, as seen here, the use of a serum standard signi\ufb01cantly reduced inter-laboratory variation. Our data showed a reduction in %GCV of more than half, to less than 80% for each in\ufb02uenza A subtype and B lineage tested after normalization.

Data in grey indicate in-house assays, data in green indicate FLUCOP assays. The majority of published \ufb01gures on inter-laboratory %GCV focus on in\ufb02uenza A viruses. The overall HAI %GCVs observed in this study for H1N1 (69%) and H3N2 (57%) are in line with or lower than previous studies (10\u201314). For HAI, the use of a consensus protocol alone (without standardized reagents) did not show a statistically signi\ufb01cant difference for the 6 laboratories that tested FLUCOP and in-house protocols side by side. Although this study was not initially designed to compare FLUCOP and in-house methods, our analysis shows agreement with previous studies that demonstrate a stricker level of harmonization than protocol sharing is required to be effective in reducing inter-laboratory variability (2, 15). It was clear that the use of a pool of serum as a study standard was effective in reducing inter-laboratory variation, again consistent with published studies (2, 10, 13, 15). This adds to the growing body of evidence in favor of developing seasonal in\ufb02uenza serology standards. MN assays had intrinsically higher levels of variability within a run (re\ufb02ected by 8.2% of coded duplicates failing in MN testing compared to 1.8% for HAI) but run to run variation was lower (4.8% of data are excluded from MN analysis due to high between-run variability compared to 11% of data for HAI). Much of the excluded data for HAI comes from strain speci\ufb01c dif\ufb01culties in balancing viruses between runs (particularly for B strains), skewing the data slightly. The considerably higher levels of inter-laboratory %GCV seen for MN assays (range of 133%-230%) likely re\ufb02ect the higher diversity in protocols for MN assays, with multiple readout methods. Other studies agree that MN assays have higher inter-laboratory variation than HAI (10, 13, 14). In comparison to previous studies, the %GCV observed for absolute titres in this EQA is consistent, with values in the hundreds \u2013 in fact %GCVs for MN assays have previously been reported with higher values than seen here: H3N2%GCVs in the range of 256-359 (14), H1N1%GCVs in the range of 204-383 (13) and H5N1%GCVs in the range of 112-185 (10). In each of these studies, as seen here, the use of a serum standard signi\ufb01cantly reduced inter-laboratory variation. Our data showed a reduction in %GCV of more than half, to less than 80% for each in\ufb02uenza A subtype and B lineage tested after normalization. This paper represents a feasibility study for carrying out a regular EQA for seasonal in\ufb02uenza serology, gauging the interest of laboratories for participating in such an activity.

In this study %GCVs for B lineage viruses were more than double compared to %GCVs for in\ufb02uenza A viruses. Participants of this EQA reported that despite careful balancing of B lineage viruses during HAIs, run-run differences in HAI titres were high. It is possible that batch-batch variations in TRBCs have a greater impact on B viruses due to differences in receptor binding af\ufb01nities between in\ufb02uenza A and B strains. B viruses are known to undergo egg adaptation, augmenting binding to avian sialic acid residues (7), however there is evidence that egg adaptation in B viruses contrasts to that seen in in\ufb02uenza A viruses, in that adaptation may involve multiple viral factors resulting in an increased ability to bind a2,3 receptors in eggs without losing the avidity for human receptors (8). Studies additionally indicate that the steric con\ufb01guration of asialyl sugars of the receptor analogue may have a greater impact on binding avidity of B in\ufb02uenza viruses than the analogue being an a2,3 or a2,6 linked sialyl-glycan (8, 9).
