Figure 5 plots the max-min ratios for all samples for each testing laboratory, with the cut off of 3.5 as a dotted line. Data above the 3.5 cut off were excluded from further analysis. Overall, 4.8% of the data were excluded (H1N1: 7.9%, H3N2: 5.6%, B Victoria 3.0% and B Yamagata 3.0%). Intra-assay (or within-run) variability was assessed by calculating the maximum to minimum ratio of four pairs of coded duplicates in the serum panel. 92% (334/364) of coded duplicates had maximum to minimum ratios of \u22643.5, with 41% of duplicates being equal. A small number of coded duplicates (5/ 364) have higher ratios due to conversion of any titres stating >t to 2*t. Labs no.4 and 7 had slightly higher incidence of duplicate ratios >3.5 (33% for Lab no.4 and 25% for Lab no.7 compared to 8.2% across all testing laboratories). Overall, the MN assay is intrinsically more variable within a run than the HAI. Considering the more complex nature of the assay and the use of live cells, this is perhaps not surprising. 3.3.2 Intra-laboratory variability We conducted an assessment of intra-laboratory (or between- run) variability by calculating maximum-minimum ratios across the independent replicates performed by the testing laboratories. Several laboratories returned only 2 independent replicates, so we included data where 2 or more independent replicates were carried out.

Data from in-house testing are shown in black, data from FLUCOP testing are shown in red. A between laboratory analysis was carried out using two different comparison methods: GMRs of each sample and % GCV of log10 titres. GMRs show a large difference in overall titres between different laboratories and protocols (see Figure 6A). Unlike HAI data, high levels of variation are seen for each subtype and lineage tested in MN. Ratios in general cluster for each laboratory, suggesting a systematic bias in testing rather than random error. % GCVs across the serum panel were much higher for MN testing than for HAI (see Figures 6B, C). Higher inter-laboratory variability is seen for B Yamagata in particular (overall %GCV 230%). %GCV is lowest for the H3N2 subtype (overall %GCV 133%).

A small number of coded duplicates (5/ 364) have higher ratios due to conversion of any titres stating >t to 2*t. Labs no.4 and 7 had slightly higher incidence of duplicate ratios >3.5 (33% for Lab no.4 and 25% for Lab no.7 compared to 8.2% across all testing laboratories). Overall, the MN assay is intrinsically more variable within a run than the HAI. Considering the more complex nature of the assay and the use of live cells, this is perhaps not surprising. 3.3.2 Intra-laboratory variability We conducted an assessment of intra-laboratory (or between- run) variability by calculating maximum-minimum ratios across the independent replicates performed by the testing laboratories. Several laboratories returned only 2 independent replicates, so we included data where 2 or more independent replicates were carried out. Table 2 gives the % of samples giving equal, ~2-fold and~4-fold or greater difference in titres across the replicates for each individual laboratory broken down by in\ufb02uenza A subtype and B lineage. The 3.3.3 Inter-laboratory variability Supplementary Figure S3A shows the overall returned MN data (after data exclusion as described in statistical analysis) from all laboratories for each in\ufb02uenza A subtype and B lineage. Data from in-house testing are shown in black, data from FLUCOP testing are shown in red. A between laboratory analysis was carried out using two different comparison methods: GMRs of each sample and % GCV of log10 titres. GMRs show a large difference in overall titres between different laboratories and protocols (see Figure 6A). Unlike HAI data, high levels of variation are seen for each subtype and lineage tested in MN. Ratios in general cluster for each laboratory, suggesting a systematic bias in testing rather than random error. % GCVs across the serum panel were much higher for MN testing than for HAI (see Figures 6B, C). Higher inter-laboratory variability is seen for B Yamagata in particular (overall %GCV 230%). %GCV is lowest for the H3N2 subtype (overall %GCV 133%). As only 3 laboratories carried out MN using the WHO ELISA protocol (designated FLU in \ufb01gures), and not all subtypes/lineages were tested, it is not possible to compare consensus and in-house protocols.

The impact of normalization using these study standards was explored by comparison of %GCV of log10 titres before and after normalization with one of these pools (sample 17) and a comparison of GMRs before and after normalization. Supplementary Figure S3B gives a summary of normalized MN titres across the 8 testing laboratories. It is clear that after normalization titres cluster closer together for each sample.

Intra-assay (or within-run) variability was assessed by calculating the maximum to minimum ratio of four pairs of coded duplicates in the serum panel. 92% (334/364) of coded duplicates had maximum to minimum ratios of \u22643.5, with 41% of duplicates being equal.
