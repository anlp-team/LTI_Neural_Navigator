Meteorological and Pollutant Data We used surface meteorological data from Haidian Station of the China Meteorological Administration, including the temperature, relative humidity, wind direction and wind speed (for location, see Figure 1). We obtained data on pollutants from the National Environmental Monitoring Center of China and used the arithmetic mean of 35 monitoring stations in Beijing to represent the overall air quality in Beijing [61]. Because Wanliu Station is close to the CAMS observatory (about 5 km), we used PM2.5 data from Wanliu Station to represent the air quality in urban Beijing. The pollutant data included the hourly average data for PM2.5, SO2, NO2 and CO, and the 8-h sliding average data for O3. We used daily sounding data at 08:00 and 20:00 from a sounding balloon at Beijing South Suburban Observatory (54511), including the pressure, temperature, temperature dew point difference, wind direction and wind speed. We obtained the convective available potential energy (CAPE) between 1000 and 100 hPa. When the CAPE is negative, it is expressed by the convective inhibition (CIN), which indicates that the lifting of pollutants is inhibited; dispersion will be strongly inhibited when the absolute value of CIN is >100 J kg\u22121 [62,63]. CAPE = Rd (cid:90) LFC EL T(cid:48) v \u2212 Tvdlnp where Rd is the dry gas constant (Rd = 287 J\u00b7kg\u22121K\u22121), p is the pressure and T(cid:48) v \u2212 Tv is the difference between the virtual temperature of the micro-cluster of lifted air and the virtual temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. LFC is the level of free convection and EL is the equilibrium level [64]. The radar wind pro\ufb01ler deployed at Haidian Park (54399) provides the horizontal wind direction and speed and the vertical velocity below about 3 km above the ground with a vertical resolution of 120 m and a temporal resolution of 6 min, measured from 150 m [65,66]. We explored the interactions between the wind \ufb01eld and changes in the concentration of pollutant during HPEs. 4 of 22 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 22 Figure 1.

Meteorological and Pollutant Data We used surface meteorological data from Haidian Station of the China Meteorological Administration, including the temperature, relative humidity, wind direction and wind speed (for location, see Figure 1). We obtained data on pollutants from the National Environmental Monitoring Center of China and used the arithmetic mean of 35 monitoring stations in Beijing to represent the overall air quality in Beijing [61]. Because Wanliu Station is close to the CAMS observatory (about 5 km), we used PM2.5 data from Wanliu Station to represent the air quality in urban Beijing. The pollutant data included the hourly average data for PM2.5, SO2, NO2 and CO, and the 8-h sliding average data for O3. We used daily sounding data at 08:00 and 20:00 from a sounding balloon at Beijing South Suburban Observatory (54511), including the pressure, temperature, temperature dew point difference, wind direction and wind speed. We obtained the convective available potential energy (CAPE) between 1000 and 100 hPa. When the CAPE is negative, it is expressed by the convective inhibition (CIN), which indicates that the lifting of pollutants is inhibited; dispersion will be strongly inhibited when the absolute value of CIN is >100 J kg\u22121 [62,63]. CAPE = Rd (cid:90) LFC EL T(cid:48) v \u2212 Tvdlnp where Rd is the dry gas constant (Rd = 287 J\u00b7kg\u22121K\u22121), p is the pressure and T(cid:48) v \u2212 Tv is the difference between the virtual temperature of the micro-cluster of lifted air and the virtual temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. LFC is the level of free convection and EL is the equilibrium level [64]. The radar wind pro\ufb01ler deployed at Haidian Park (54399) provides the horizontal wind direction and speed and the vertical velocity below about 3 km above the ground with a vertical resolution of 120 m and a temporal resolution of 6 min, measured from 150 m [65,66].

Because Wanliu Station is close to the CAMS observatory (about 5 km), we used PM2.5 data from Wanliu Station to represent the air quality in urban Beijing. The pollutant data included the hourly average data for PM2.5, SO2, NO2 and CO, and the 8-h sliding average data for O3. We used daily sounding data at 08:00 and 20:00 from a sounding balloon at Beijing South Suburban Observatory (54511), including the pressure, temperature, temperature dew point difference, wind direction and wind speed. We obtained the convective available potential energy (CAPE) between 1000 and 100 hPa. When the CAPE is negative, it is expressed by the convective inhibition (CIN), which indicates that the lifting of pollutants is inhibited; dispersion will be strongly inhibited when the absolute value of CIN is >100 J kg\u22121 [62,63]. CAPE = Rd (cid:90) LFC EL T(cid:48) v \u2212 Tvdlnp where Rd is the dry gas constant (Rd = 287 J\u00b7kg\u22121K\u22121), p is the pressure and T(cid:48) v \u2212 Tv is the difference between the virtual temperature of the micro-cluster of lifted air and the virtual temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. LFC is the level of free convection and EL is the equilibrium level [64]. The radar wind pro\ufb01ler deployed at Haidian Park (54399) provides the horizontal wind direction and speed and the vertical velocity below about 3 km above the ground with a vertical resolution of 120 m and a temporal resolution of 6 min, measured from 150 m [65,66]. We explored the interactions between the wind \ufb01eld and changes in the concentration of pollutant during HPEs. 4 of 22 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 22 Figure 1.

Results and Discussion 3.1. Climatological Characteristics of the Vertical Distribution of Aerosols As an important parameter of the aerosol extinction capacity, the extinction coefficient reflects the aerosol load in the atmosphere, whereas the aerosol vertical profile reflects the vertical distribution of aerosols [67]. Figure 2 shows the characteristics of the inter-month variation of the atmospheric extinction coefficient in urban Beijing from autumn 2017 to winter 2020. The area with the maximum change in the vertical profile of the extinction coefficient in all months is concentrated within 2 km above ground level (monthly average value of the extinction coefficient >0.1 km(cid:2879)1). The aerosol extinction coefficient decreases with increasing height, which suggests that the concentration of atmospheric aerosols in urban Beijing is highest near ground level [67]. Figure 2.

Meteorological and Pollutant Data We used surface meteorological data from Haidian Station of the China Meteorological Administration, including the temperature, relative humidity, wind direction and wind speed (for location, see Figure 1). We obtained data on pollutants from the National Environmental Monitoring Center of China and used the arithmetic mean of 35 monitoring stations in Beijing to represent the overall air quality in Beijing [61].
