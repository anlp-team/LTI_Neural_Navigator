The requirement for written informed consent was waived by the Institutional Review Board owing to the retrospective observational nature of the study, and all patient data are treated confidentially. The data of treatment-naive patients who underwent preoperative liver Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and curative hepatic resection for HCC at our institution between December 2017 and December 2021 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were age >18 years and presence of a single histopathologically confirmed HCC lesion. The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) more than a 2-month interval between Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and surgery, (2) suboptimal MRI quality, (3) pathologically confirmed macroscopic vascular invasion, (4) extrahepatic spread on preoperative work-up, (5) incomplete clinical and laboratory data, (6) lack of follow-up data, and (7) history of preoperative HCC-related treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, or immunosuppressive therapy). MRI Protocol Patients underwent upper abdominal MRI using two 3.0-T MRI vectors with an 8-channel Atlas Speeder phased-array coil (Titan; Toshiba Medical Systems, Tochigi, Japan) or 18-channel phased-array coil (Prisma; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). All patients fasted for at least 8 h before MRI examination. Axial T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced images were obtained in all the cases. Each patient received 0.1 mL/kg of gadoxetic acid disodium (Primovist; Bayer Vital GmbH, Berlin, Germany) at a flow rate of 2 mL/s to acquire Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced images. Arterial phase, portal phase, and HBP images were obtained 15 s, 60\u201370 s, and 20 min after contrast injection, respectively.

They were required to count the number, measure the longest diameter of each target observation, and classify the imaging features of each HCC lesion. Two weeks before the formal assessment, they were required to discuss the presentation of each MRI feature, and were trained in 20 cases. The definition of imaging features on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI has been described in other studies and is documented in Table S2.8\u201310 The interobserver agreement was assessed after independent image review. In the event of disagreement between the two radiologists, a senior radiologist (Z.Y.C., with 15 years of experience in liver MRI) reviewed the images and discussed them with the other two radiologists, and a consensus was reached by a majority vote. Clinical and Laboratory Data Clinical (age, sex, etiology of chronic liver disease) and laboratory data (white blood cells [WBC], red blood cells [RBC], hemoglobin [HB], platelets [PLT], prothrombin time [PT], international normalized ratio of prothrombin [INR], activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT], fibrinogen [FIB], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], albumin [ALB], globulin [GLB], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT], total bilirubin [TBIL], creatinine [Cr]), and serum alpha-fetoprotein [AFP]) within 1 week before hepatectomy were reviewed. The Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) stage and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score were calculated for each patient according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guidelines.11 Histological Evaluation After surgical resection, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and evaluated by a senior pathologist with 15 years of experience in liver pathology, according to the seven-point baseline sampling protocol. Histopathological reports included tumor number, tumor size, Edmondson grade, MVI status, and final diagnosis. MVI was defined as the presence of tumor cells in the endothelium-lined vascular lumen observed only by microscopy. Follow-Up After Surgical Resection All patients underwent clinical and radiological follow-up at 1 month after hepatectomy, at 3-month intervals for the first 2 years, and at 6-month intervals for up to 5 years thereafter. Radiological follow-up consisted of ultrasonography, dynamic-enhanced computed tomography, or Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. When recurrence was suspected clinically or radiologically, appropriate management was implemented according to our institutional protocol and the AASLD guidelines. Patients were censored in the event of local recurrence, loss to follow-up, or on March 1, 2023, whichever event occurred first. Intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) was defined as the time interval between hepatectomy and intrahepatic recurrence. Statistical Analysis Continuous variables were reported as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]) and were compared between groups using Student\u2019s t-test or Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, as appropriate. Categorical variables were reported as frequency (percentage) and compared between groups using the chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test, as appropriate. Interobserver agreement regarding MRI features was assessed using the Cohen\u2019s kappa (\u03ba) value and graded based on the Landis and Koch scale (0.00, poor agreement; 0.01\u20130.20, slight agreement; 0.21\u20130.40, fair agreement; 0.41\u2013 0.60, moderate agreement; 0.61\u20130.80, substantial agreement; and >0.80, nearly perfect agreement).12 The relationship between radiological variables and MVI status was assessed using univariate logistic regression analysis. Variables with a P-value <0.05 in univariate analysis were entered into multivariate logistic regression analysis with stepwise forward selection to identify independent risk factors. Prediction performance was assessed by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), Journal of Hepatocellular Carcinoma 2023:10 https://doi.org/10.2147/JHC.S422632 1597 DovePress Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Chen et al Dovepress sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).

They were required to count the number, measure the longest diameter of each target observation, and classify the imaging features of each HCC lesion. Two weeks before the formal assessment, they were required to discuss the presentation of each MRI feature, and were trained in 20 cases. The definition of imaging features on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI has been described in other studies and is documented in Table S2.8\u201310 The interobserver agreement was assessed after independent image review. In the event of disagreement between the two radiologists, a senior radiologist (Z.Y.C., with 15 years of experience in liver MRI) reviewed the images and discussed them with the other two radiologists, and a consensus was reached by a majority vote. Clinical and Laboratory Data Clinical (age, sex, etiology of chronic liver disease) and laboratory data (white blood cells [WBC], red blood cells [RBC], hemoglobin [HB], platelets [PLT], prothrombin time [PT], international normalized ratio of prothrombin [INR], activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT], fibrinogen [FIB], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], albumin [ALB], globulin [GLB], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT], total bilirubin [TBIL], creatinine [Cr]), and serum alpha-fetoprotein [AFP]) within 1 week before hepatectomy were reviewed. The Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) stage and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score were calculated for each patient according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guidelines.11 Histological Evaluation After surgical resection, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and evaluated by a senior pathologist with 15 years of experience in liver pathology, according to the seven-point baseline sampling protocol. Histopathological reports included tumor number, tumor size, Edmondson grade, MVI status, and final diagnosis. MVI was defined as the presence of tumor cells in the endothelium-lined vascular lumen observed only by microscopy. Follow-Up After Surgical Resection All patients underwent clinical and radiological follow-up at 1 month after hepatectomy, at 3-month intervals for the first 2 years, and at 6-month intervals for up to 5 years thereafter. Radiological follow-up consisted of ultrasonography, dynamic-enhanced computed tomography, or Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. When recurrence was suspected clinically or radiologically, appropriate management was implemented according to our institutional protocol and the AASLD guidelines. Patients were censored in the event of local recurrence, loss to follow-up, or on March 1, 2023, whichever event occurred first. Intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) was defined as the time interval between hepatectomy and intrahepatic recurrence. Statistical Analysis Continuous variables were reported as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]) and were compared between groups using Student\u2019s t-test or Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, as appropriate. Categorical variables were reported as frequency (percentage) and compared between groups using the chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test, as appropriate. Interobserver agreement regarding MRI features was assessed using the Cohen\u2019s kappa (\u03ba) value and graded based on the Landis and Koch scale (0.00, poor agreement; 0.01\u20130.20, slight agreement; 0.21\u20130.40, fair agreement; 0.41\u2013 0.60, moderate agreement; 0.61\u20130.80, substantial agreement; and >0.80, nearly perfect agreement).12 The relationship between radiological variables and MVI status was assessed using univariate logistic regression analysis. Variables with a P-value <0.05 in univariate analysis were entered into multivariate logistic regression analysis with stepwise forward selection to identify independent risk factors.

Follow-Up After Surgical Resection All patients underwent clinical and radiological follow-up at 1 month after hepatectomy, at 3-month intervals for the first 2 years, and at 6-month intervals for up to 5 years thereafter. Radiological follow-up consisted of ultrasonography, dynamic-enhanced computed tomography, or Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. When recurrence was suspected clinically or radiologically, appropriate management was implemented according to our institutional protocol and the AASLD guidelines. Patients were censored in the event of local recurrence, loss to follow-up, or on March 1, 2023, whichever event occurred first. Intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) was defined as the time interval between hepatectomy and intrahepatic recurrence. Statistical Analysis Continuous variables were reported as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]) and were compared between groups using Student\u2019s t-test or Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, as appropriate. Categorical variables were reported as frequency (percentage) and compared between groups using the chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test, as appropriate. Interobserver agreement regarding MRI features was assessed using the Cohen\u2019s kappa (\u03ba) value and graded based on the Landis and Koch scale (0.00, poor agreement; 0.01\u20130.20, slight agreement; 0.21\u20130.40, fair agreement; 0.41\u2013 0.60, moderate agreement; 0.61\u20130.80, substantial agreement; and >0.80, nearly perfect agreement).12 The relationship between radiological variables and MVI status was assessed using univariate logistic regression analysis. Variables with a P-value <0.05 in univariate analysis were entered into multivariate logistic regression analysis with stepwise forward selection to identify independent risk factors.

The requirement for written informed consent was waived by the Institutional Review Board owing to the retrospective observational nature of the study, and all patient data are treated confidentially. The data of treatment-naive patients who underwent preoperative liver Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and curative hepatic resection for HCC at our institution between December 2017 and December 2021 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were age >18 years and presence of a single histopathologically confirmed HCC lesion. The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) more than a 2-month interval between Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and surgery, (2) suboptimal MRI quality, (3) pathologically confirmed macroscopic vascular invasion, (4) extrahepatic spread on preoperative work-up, (5) incomplete clinical and laboratory data, (6) lack of follow-up data, and (7) history of preoperative HCC-related treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, or immunosuppressive therapy). MRI Protocol Patients underwent upper abdominal MRI using two 3.0-T MRI vectors with an 8-channel Atlas Speeder phased-array coil (Titan; Toshiba Medical Systems, Tochigi, Japan) or 18-channel phased-array coil (Prisma; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). All patients fasted for at least 8 h before MRI examination. Axial T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced images were obtained in all the cases. Each patient received 0.1 mL/kg of gadoxetic acid disodium (Primovist; Bayer Vital GmbH, Berlin, Germany) at a flow rate of 2 mL/s to acquire Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced images. Arterial phase, portal phase, and HBP images were obtained 15 s, 60\u201370 s, and 20 min after contrast injection, respectively.

They were required to count the number, measure the longest diameter of each target observation, and classify the imaging features of each HCC lesion. Two weeks before the formal assessment, they were required to discuss the presentation of each MRI feature, and were trained in 20 cases. The definition of imaging features on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI has been described in other studies and is documented in Table S2.8\u201310 The interobserver agreement was assessed after independent image review. In the event of disagreement between the two radiologists, a senior radiologist (Z.Y.C., with 15 years of experience in liver MRI) reviewed the images and discussed them with the other two radiologists, and a consensus was reached by a majority vote. Clinical and Laboratory Data Clinical (age, sex, etiology of chronic liver disease) and laboratory data (white blood cells [WBC], red blood cells [RBC], hemoglobin [HB], platelets [PLT], prothrombin time [PT], international normalized ratio of prothrombin [INR], activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT], fibrinogen [FIB], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], albumin [ALB], globulin [GLB], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT], total bilirubin [TBIL], creatinine [Cr]), and serum alpha-fetoprotein [AFP]) within 1 week before hepatectomy were reviewed. The Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) stage and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score were calculated for each patient according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guidelines.11 Histological Evaluation After surgical resection, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and evaluated by a senior pathologist with 15 years of experience in liver pathology, according to the seven-point baseline sampling protocol.
