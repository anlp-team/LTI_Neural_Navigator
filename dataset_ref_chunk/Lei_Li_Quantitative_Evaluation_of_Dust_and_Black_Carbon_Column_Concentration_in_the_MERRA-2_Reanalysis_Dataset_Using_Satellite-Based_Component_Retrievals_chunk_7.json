Same as Figure 3, but for Middle East (MIE) region. 3.1.4. Taklamakan Desert The comparison of the Taklamakan (TAK) desert in northwestern China is shown in Figure 6. We can see that the same variation in monthly means for the calculation of re-gional values is reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product pre-sent the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in April and May, whereas there are low values in November, December, and January. A correlation coeffi-cient of 0.80 is found between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the TAK region with RMSE = 122.30 mg/m2 (in Table 2). The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that over the TAK region, the dust column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component dust retrieval from May to December and February; however, it is lower for the months of January, March, and April. The maximum absolute differences of 144.7 mg/m2 and 141.7 mg/m2 are obtained in August and September, respectively, and the maximum relative difference is recorded in October (49.2%). The absolute minimum difference was obtained in January (\u22126.8 mg/m2 indicating MERRA-2 dust column con-centration is lower than GRASP/Component dust column concentration), and a minimum relative difference of 3.2% was recorded in February.

At a regional level, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the vari-ation in monthly dust column concentration over the GOB region. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in April and May, whereas low values in December and January. The correlation coefficient of 0.84 and RMSE = 74.36 mg/m2 are recorded between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the GOB region (Table 2). The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the GOB region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in June (113.0 mg/m2) and a maximum relative difference in October (52.1%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in January (13.1 mg/m2), and the minimum relative difference of 11.8% is recorded in April. Figure 7. Same as Figure 3, but for Gobi Desert (GOB) region. 3.1.6. Eastern Tropical Atlantic The accuracy of dust column concentration in downwind regions over the globe also needs to be examined. The intra-annual and interannual variations in dust column con-centration have distinctive cycles that are determined by the source or downwind region [52]. The dust particles over the tropical Atlantic Ocean are transported from the Sahara by tropical cyclones [53,54]. Dust particles originating from North Africa are also observed over the Caribbean Sea [42,55]. Therefore, we investigate the differences in dust column concentration over the Eastern Tropical Atlantic (ETA) region for these two products. Sim-ilar variations in monthly means for the calculation of regional values are reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product (Figure 8), with high values in June and July, whereas low values are in November and December. This behav-ior is consistent regardless of the differences observed, with a maximum absolute differ-ence in July (140.0 mg/m2) and a maximum relative difference in June and July (about 53%); the absolute minimum difference and relative differences are obtained in November (15.3 mg/m2 and 20.5%, respectively) (Table 3). A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.92) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the ETA region with RMSE = 86.79 mg/m2 (in Table 2). The differences could be partly at-tributed to the estimation of dust source emission intensity and their long-distance transport in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system. Figure 6.

This behav-ior is consistent regardless of the differences observed, with a maximum absolute differ-ence in July (140.0 mg/m2) and a maximum relative difference in June and July (about 53%); the absolute minimum difference and relative differences are obtained in November (15.3 mg/m2 and 20.5%, respectively) (Table 3). A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.92) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the ETA region with RMSE = 86.79 mg/m2 (in Table 2).

At a regional level, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the vari-ation in monthly dust column concentration over the GOB region. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in April and May, whereas low values in December and January. The correlation coefficient of 0.84 and RMSE = 74.36 mg/m2 are recorded between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the GOB region (Table 2). The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the GOB region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in June (113.0 mg/m2) and a maximum relative difference in October (52.1%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in January (13.1 mg/m2), and the minimum relative difference of 11.8% is recorded in April. Figure 7. Same as Figure 3, but for Gobi Desert (GOB) region. 3.1.6. Eastern Tropical Atlantic The accuracy of dust column concentration in downwind regions over the globe also needs to be examined. The intra-annual and interannual variations in dust column con-centration have distinctive cycles that are determined by the source or downwind region [52]. The dust particles over the tropical Atlantic Ocean are transported from the Sahara by tropical cyclones [53,54]. Dust particles originating from North Africa are also observed over the Caribbean Sea [42,55]. Therefore, we investigate the differences in dust column concentration over the Eastern Tropical Atlantic (ETA) region for these two products. Sim-ilar variations in monthly means for the calculation of regional values are reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product (Figure 8), with high values in June and July, whereas low values are in November and December. This behav-ior is consistent regardless of the differences observed, with a maximum absolute differ-ence in July (140.0 mg/m2) and a maximum relative difference in June and July (about 53%); the absolute minimum difference and relative differences are obtained in November (15.3 mg/m2 and 20.5%, respectively) (Table 3). A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.92) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the ETA region with RMSE = 86.79 mg/m2 (in Table 2). The differences could be partly at-tributed to the estimation of dust source emission intensity and their long-distance transport in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system. Figure 6.

We can see that the same variation in monthly means for the calculation of re-gional values is reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product pre-sent the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in April and May, whereas there are low values in November, December, and January. A correlation coeffi-cient of 0.80 is found between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the TAK region with RMSE = 122.30 mg/m2 (in Table 2). The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that over the TAK region, the dust column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component dust retrieval from May to December and February; however, it is lower for the months of January, March, and April. The maximum absolute differences of 144.7 mg/m2 and 141.7 mg/m2 are obtained in August and September, respectively, and the maximum relative difference is recorded in October (49.2%). The absolute minimum difference was obtained in January (\u22126.8 mg/m2 indicating MERRA-2 dust column con-centration is lower than GRASP/Component dust column concentration), and a minimum relative difference of 3.2% was recorded in February.
