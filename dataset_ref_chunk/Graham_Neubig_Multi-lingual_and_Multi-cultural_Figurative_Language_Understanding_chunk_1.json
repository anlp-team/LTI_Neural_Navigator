Differences in figurative expres- sions used in different languages may be due to cul- tural values, history, or any number of other factors that vary across where the languages are spoken.2 Understanding figurative language therefore relies on understanding what concepts or objects are con- sidered culturally significant, as well as their senti- ment in that culture. When you are feeling happy, do you think that you are \u201cwarm\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d? If you are a monolingual English speaker, you will likely answer \u201cwarm\u201d, and use expressions like \u201cthis really warmed my heart\u201d. However, if you are a native Hindi speaker, you may answer \u201ccold\u201d, and use expressions like (cid:606)\u0926\u0932 \u0915\u094b \u0920\u0902 \u0921\u0915 \u092a\u095d\u0928\u093e (\u201ccoldness spreads in one\u2019s heart\u201d ) (Sharma, 2017).

However, state-of- the-art language models have been shown to fre- quently misinterpret both novel figurative expres- sions and conventionalized idioms, indicating the need for improved methods (Dankers et al., 2022\u037e \u2217 These authors contributed equally. 1Data and code is simran-khanuja/Multilingual-Fig-QA released at https://github.com/ 2The Hindi example is most likely attributable to climatic con- ditions, as cold may be seen as comparatively more positive in an area where extreme heat is more common (Sharma, 2017) Liu et al., 2022).

Exam- ples are shown in Table 1. We use the dataset to conduct a systematic anal- ysis of figurative language patterns across lan- guages and how well they are captured by cur- rent multilingual models (\u00a74). We find that figura- tive language is often very culturally-specific, and makes reference to important entities within a cul- ture, such as food, mythology, famous people, or plants and animals native to specific regions. We benchmark multilingual model performance (\u00a75) and analyze model failures (\u00a76), finding that zero-shot performance of multilingual models is relatively poor, especially for lower-resource lan- guages. According to (Liu et al., 2021), main fac- tors which poses challenges on the performance in such cases are cross-lingual transfer and concept shift across languages. However, we observe that concept shift seems to play a larger role due to cul- turally specific examples. Adding a few examples in the target language can improve performance of larger models, but this is more beneficial for lower-resource languages. This highlights the im- portance of including culturally relevant training data, particularly data that highlights not just the existence of a concept, but also how people view that concept within that culture. 2 Linguistic and Cultural Biases of Existing Figurative Language Datasets To confirm the importance of building a multi- lingual, multi-cultural figurative language dataset, we first performed a pilot study to examine the fea- sibility of instead translating an existing figurative language dataset, Fig-QA (Liu et al., 2022), from Lang. fr hi ja Incorrect Culturally irrelevant 13% 40%"}, {"question": " How many languages are included in the MABL dataset?", "answer": " Seven languages: Hindi, Indonesian, Javanese, Kannada, Sundanese, Swahili, and Yoruba.", "ref_chunk": "Multi-lingual and Multi-cultural Figurative Language Understanding Anubha Kabra1\u2217, Emmy Liu1\u2217, Simran Khanuja1\u2217, Alham Fikri Aji2, Genta Indra Winata3, Samuel Cahyawijaya4, Anuoluwapo Aremu5, Perez Ogayo1, Graham Neubig1 1Carnegie Mellon University 2MBZUAI 3Bloomberg 4HKUST 5Masakhane Abstract Figurative Expression Inference 1 Figurative language permeates human commu- nication, but at the same time is relatively un- derstudied in NLP.

Datasets have been cre- ated in English to accelerate progress towards measuring and improving figurative language processing in language models (LMs). How- ever, the use of figurative language is an ex- pression of our cultural and societal experi- ences, making it difficult for these phrases to be universally applicable. In this work, we create a figurative language inference dataset, MABL, for seven diverse languages associated with a variety of cultures: Hindi, Indonesian, Javanese, Kannada, Sundanese, Swahili and Yoruba. Our dataset reveals that each language relies on cultural and regional concepts for fig- urative expressions, with the highest overlap between languages originating from the same region. We assess multilingual LMs\u2019 abili- ties to interpret figurative language in zero- shot and few-shot settings. All languages ex- hibit a significant deficiency compared to En- glish, with variations in performance reflecting the availability of pre-training and fine-tuning data, emphasizing the need for LMs to be ex- posed to a broader range of linguistic and cul- tural variation during training. 1 Introduction yo Omah iku kaya istana (The house is like a palace.)

Lakoff and Johnson, 1981), which is laden with im- plicit cultural references and judgements that vary cross-culturally. Differences in figurative expres- sions used in different languages may be due to cul- tural values, history, or any number of other factors that vary across where the languages are spoken.2 Understanding figurative language therefore relies on understanding what concepts or objects are con- sidered culturally significant, as well as their senti- ment in that culture. When you are feeling happy, do you think that you are \u201cwarm\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d? If you are a monolingual English speaker, you will likely answer \u201cwarm\u201d, and use expressions like \u201cthis really warmed my heart\u201d. However, if you are a native Hindi speaker, you may answer \u201ccold\u201d, and use expressions like (cid:606)\u0926\u0932 \u0915\u094b \u0920\u0902 \u0921\u0915 \u092a\u095d\u0928\u093e (\u201ccoldness spreads in one\u2019s heart\u201d ) (Sharma, 2017). Linguistic communica- tion often involves figurative (i.e., non-literal) lan- guage (Shutova, 2011\u037e Fussell and Moss, 2008\u037e Better understanding of figurative language would benefit tasks such as hate speech detec- tion or sentiment classification (ElSherief et al., 2021\u037e van Aken et al., 2018). However, state-of- the-art language models have been shown to fre- quently misinterpret both novel figurative expres- sions and conventionalized idioms, indicating the need for improved methods (Dankers et al., 2022\u037e \u2217 These authors contributed equally. 1Data and code is simran-khanuja/Multilingual-Fig-QA released at https://github.com/ 2The Hindi example is most likely attributable to climatic con- ditions, as cold may be seen as comparatively more positive in an area where extreme heat is more common (Sharma, 2017) Liu et al., 2022). Most empirical results probing language models\u2019 abilities with respect to figura- tive language have been based on data in English, meaning there is a comparative lack of resources and study in other languages (Chakrabarty et al., 2022\u037e Liu et al., 2022\u037e Pedinotti et al., 2021a). We find English figurative language datasets may not have cultural relevance for other lan- guages (\u00a72). This is a general challenge in NLP, as assumptions of common knowledge and impor- tant topics to talk about vary from culture to cul- In order to bet- ture (Hershcovich et al., 2022). ter train multilingual models to interpret figura- tive language, as well as to understand linguistic variation in figurative expressions, we construct a multilingual dataset, MABL (Metaphors Across Borders and Languages), of 6,366 figurative lan- guage expressions in seven languages (\u00a73). Exam- ples are shown in Table 1. We use the dataset to conduct a systematic anal- ysis of figurative language patterns across lan- guages and how well they are captured by cur- rent multilingual models (\u00a74). We find that figura- tive language is often very culturally-specific, and makes reference to important entities within a cul- ture, such as food, mythology, famous people, or plants and animals native to specific regions. We benchmark multilingual model performance (\u00a75) and analyze model failures (\u00a76), finding that zero-shot performance of multilingual models is relatively poor, especially for lower-resource lan- guages. According to (Liu et al., 2021), main fac- tors which poses challenges on the performance in such cases are cross-lingual transfer and concept shift across languages. However, we observe that concept shift seems to play a larger role due to cul- turally specific examples. Adding a few examples in the target language can improve performance of larger models, but this is more beneficial for lower-resource languages. This highlights the im- portance of including culturally relevant training data, particularly data that highlights not just the existence of a concept, but also how people view that concept within that culture. 2 Linguistic and Cultural Biases of Existing Figurative Language Datasets To confirm the importance of building a multi- lingual, multi-cultural figurative language dataset, we first performed a pilot study to examine the fea- sibility of instead translating an existing figurative language dataset, Fig-QA (Liu et al., 2022), from Lang. fr hi ja Incorrect Culturally irrelevant 13% 40%"}
