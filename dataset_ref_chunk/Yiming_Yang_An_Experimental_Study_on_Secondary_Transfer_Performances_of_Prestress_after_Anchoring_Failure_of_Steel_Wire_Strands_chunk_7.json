[CrossRef] 24. Wang, L.; Zhang, X.H.;"}], "doc_text": "post-tensioning components have relatively small sizes in this study, which will bring greater losses of prestress. Hence, secondary transfer performances of prestress based on actual bridge size components have to be further studied. Additionally, reliability evaluation and prediction of existing bridges also have to be further studied with considerations made to the types of corrugated pipes used and the loosening of the steel wire strands. The limitation of this study is that only the secondary transfer of residual prestress of short specimens is considered, and the transfer law of longer specimens needs to be further studied.
