Training Data Overview Data Freshness 3.6M Arabic instructions and about 6M English instructions are part of the instruction-tuning set. Prompt and response pairs in English have been col- lected from multiple publicly available sources, and suitable instruction\u2013 response pairs have been translated automatically to Arabic using an in-house machine translation system.
