However, the K value of the crack tip at the bottom of the corrosion pit is always signi\ufb01cantly higher than the value at both ends. The crack propagation rate reaches its maximum when it propagates to the bottom of the pit. From the perspective of the whole crack tip section, when the crack tip extends to the left edge of the pit, the K of the crack tip near the pit edge is the highest. This is di\ufb00erent from the distribution of K at the crack tip of the non-corroded specimen.

It shows that the K value of the crack tip gradually decreases from the side with the corrosion pit (from 2 or 1 in Figure 17) to the other side, and the stress is still the highest near the pit.

This indicates that the corrosion pit around the crack propagation surface will reach the yield state \ufb01rst, and a stronger stress \ufb01eld can be ob-served near the crack tip. Figure 17.

Conclusions In this study, the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance steel was experimentally investigated. The fatigue crack growth performance of Q550 was compared with that of Q235. The e\ufb00ects of some factors, such as the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting, on crack propagation were numerically studied. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: 1. The crack growth rate of Q550E is obviously higher than that of Q235 in the late stage of crack growth. The crack"}, {"question": " At what crack propagation length does the crack propagation rate increase significantly?", "answer": " 16 mm", "ref_chunk": "elliptical, and hemispherical, of which hemispherical corrosion pits are the most widely used [32]. Therefore, a hemispherical corrosion pit with a radius of 2 mm was prefabricated on the specimens based on the existing research [31]. The sine wave continuous load reduction method was adopted to prefabricate an initial 2 mm fatigue crack. The data of the \ufb01rst 2 mm of the initial crack are relatively discrete in the formal propagation process; thus, the centre of the pit was positioned 4 mm away from the crack tip of the specimen. The effects of various pit depths on the crack propagation were analysed for cases of 0.25 B, 0.5 B, and 0.75 B (relative to CT specimen thickness B, namely, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1). As shown in Figure 16, before the crack propagation length reaches 12 mm, the corrosion pits do not affect the fatigue life. Then, when the front line of the crack reaches the edge of the pit, the crack propagation rate begins to increase slowly. When the crack propagation length reaches 16 mm, that is, the crack passes through the bottom of the pit, the crack propagation rate increases signi\ufb01cantly. Therefore, the corrosion pit has little effect on the crack propagation in the early stage of the corrosion pit (less than 12 mm), and the fatigue life of the specimen is obviously different when the crack passes through the corrosion pit.

From the perspective of the whole crack tip section, when the crack tip extends to the left edge of the pit, the K of the crack tip near the pit edge is the highest. This is di\ufb00erent from the distribution of K at the crack tip of the non-corroded specimen.

From the perspective of the whole crack tip section, when the crack tip extends to the left edge of the pit, the K of the crack tip near the pit edge is the highest. This is di\ufb00erent from the distribution of K at the crack tip of the non-corroded specimen. This shows that the Metals 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 18 Metals 2023, 13, 1496 15 of 18 specimen with a corrosion pit is in a dangerous stress state under the action of fatigue load. Figure 18 shows a diagram of the stress state of the crack tip at the end of crack prop-agation in the corrosion pit. It shows that the K value of the crack tip gradually decreases from the side with the corrosion pit (from 2 or 1 in Figure 17) to the other side, and the stress is still the highest near the pit. This indicates that the corrosion pit around the crack propagation surface will reach the yield state \ufb01rst, and a stronger stress \ufb01eld can be ob-served near the crack tip. Figure 17.

Conclusions In this study, the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance steel was experimentally investigated. The fatigue crack growth performance of Q550 was compared with that of Q235. The e\ufb00ects of some factors, such as the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting, on crack propagation were numerically studied. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: 1. The crack growth rate of Q550E is obviously higher than that of Q235 in the late stage of crack growth. The crack"}], "doc_text": "elliptical, and hemispherical, of which hemispherical corrosion pits are the most widely used [32]. Therefore, a hemispherical corrosion pit with a radius of 2 mm was prefabricated on the specimens based on the existing research [31]. The sine wave continuous load reduction method was adopted to prefabricate an initial 2 mm fatigue crack. The data of the \ufb01rst 2 mm of the initial crack are relatively discrete in the formal propagation process; thus, the centre of the pit was positioned 4 mm away from the crack tip of the specimen. The effects of various pit depths on the crack propagation were analysed for cases of 0.25 B, 0.5 B, and 0.75 B (relative to CT specimen thickness B, namely, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1). As shown in Figure 16, before the crack propagation length reaches 12 mm, the corrosion pits do not affect the fatigue life. Then, when the front line of the crack reaches the edge of the pit, the crack propagation rate begins to increase slowly. When the crack propagation length reaches 16 mm, that is, the crack passes through the bottom of the pit, the crack propagation rate increases signi\ufb01cantly. Therefore, the corrosion pit has little effect on the crack propagation in the early stage of the corrosion pit (less than 12 mm), and the fatigue life of the specimen is obviously different when the crack passes through the corrosion pit. The maximum difference in fatigue life was 29,252 times when passing through the corrosion pit, accounting for 19% of the total life.

Corrosion Pitting Based on the research described above, a corrosion pit was prefabricated on the crack propagation line. Studies have shown that there are many forms of corrosion pit, such as conical, cylindrical, elliptical, and hemispherical, of which hemispherical corrosion pits are the most widely used [32]. Therefore, a hemispherical corrosion pit with a radius of 2 mm was prefabricated on the specimens based on the existing research [31]. The sine wave continuous load reduction method was adopted to prefabricate an initial 2 mm fatigue crack. The data of the \ufb01rst 2 mm of the initial crack are relatively discrete in the formal propagation process; thus, the centre of the pit was positioned 4 mm away from the crack tip of the specimen. The e\ufb00ects of various pit depths on the crack propagation were ana-lysed for cases of 0.25 B, 0.5 B, and 0.75 B (relative to CT specimen thickness B, namely, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1). As shown in Figure 16, before the crack propagation length reaches 12 mm, the cor-rosion pits do not a\ufb00ect the fatigue life. Then, when the front line of the crack reaches the edge of the pit, the crack propagation rate begins to increase slowly. When the crack prop-agation length reaches 16 mm, that is, the crack passes through the bottom of the pit, the crack propagation rate increases signi\ufb01cantly. Therefore, the corrosion pit has little e\ufb00ect on the crack propagation in the early stage of the corrosion pit (less than 12 mm), and the fatigue life of the specimen is obviously di\ufb00erent when the crack passes through the cor-rosion pit. The maximum di\ufb00erence in fatigue life was 29,252 times when passing through the corrosion pit, accounting for 19% of the total life. Figure 16. a\u2013N curves of di\ufb00erent corrosion pit depths. Since the crack growth rate for the case with a depth of 0.75 B was the fastest, the change in K along the crack propagation direction was further studied. As shown in Figure 17, stress \ufb02uctuation occurs when the crack propagates to the vicinity of the pit bottom because of the in\ufb02uence of stress singularity. However, the K value of the crack tip at the bottom of the corrosion pit is always signi\ufb01cantly higher than the value at both ends. The crack propagation rate reaches its maximum when it propagates to the bottom of the pit. From the perspective of the whole crack tip section, when the crack tip extends to the left edge of the pit, the K of the crack tip near the pit edge is the highest. This is di\ufb00erent from the distribution of K at the crack tip of the non-corroded specimen. This shows that the Metals 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 18 Metals 2023, 13, 1496 15 of 18 specimen with a corrosion pit is in a dangerous stress state under the action of fatigue load.
