However, with the use of LRL MT methods, we have witnessed great improvements. The Cherokee\u2013English (Zhang et al., 2020c) language pair has been explored using a pre- trained BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) for the En- glish side. A system demonstration of this ap- proach is also accessible (Zhang et al., 2021). The back translation strategy for Bribri\u2013Spanish NMT transformers has also been explored (Feldman and Coto-Solano, 2020) and by (Oncevay, 2021) (for four Peruvian languages to Spanish) with good results. The scarce indigenous language mono- lingual text can be replaced to some extent with Spanish text or extracted from PDFs, and other sources (Bustamante et al., 2020). One of the main challenges for the complex morphological languages in the area has been the prepossessing step. Schwartz et al. (2020) show that even if morphological segmentation has less perplexity a the language modeling time, it is still under-performing or equivalent against BPEs for MT (for Inuktitut-\u2013English, Yupik\u2014English Data, Guaran\u00ed\u2014Spanish Data). A more compre- hensive (on the segmentation modeling side) was done by (Mager et al., 2022) exploring a wide array of segmentation models.The latter study showed that supervised morphological segmenta- tion under-perform unsupervised. However, unsu- pervised morphological segmentation like LMVR (Ataman et al., 2017) and FlatCat (Gr\u00f6nroos et al., 2014) perform better than BPEs. (Ngoc Le and Sadat, 2020) studied how better to perform word segmentation for the Inuktitut\u2013English pair. They found that for this language pair, a morphological segmentation, or a combination of BPEs and mor- phological segmentation, works better than just applying vanilla BPEs. Also, training word em- beddings for Guarani\u2013Spanish translation is an excellent opportunity to increase the MT perfor- mance of these languages (G\u00f3ngora et al., 2022). The usage of transfer learning from multilin- gual systems has been tried, with limited re- sults (Nagoudi et al., 2021) (training an own T5 model for indigenous languages) and (Zheng et al., 2021). However, pertaining a Spanish\u2013English model together with ILA, and then fine-tuning it (together with a careful prepossessing and filter- ing step) has been the most successful strategy (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2021). The quality of MT systems of ILA has been a constant debate. However, Ebrahimi et al. (2021) shows that the quality of MT for these languages is enough to improve other tasks like natural lan- guage inference (NLI). Inuktitut\u2013Enlgish ST The WMT 2020 news translation task included Inuktitut\u2013English trans- lation (Barrault et al., 2020). The participating systems explored the difficulties of working with a polysynthetic language in a medium resource scenario. Participating teams in this competi- tion were: (Kocmi, 2020; Hernandez and Nguyen, 2020; Scherrer et al., 2020; Roest et al., 2020; Lo, 2020; Knowles et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020e; Krubi\u00b4nski et al., 2020). AmericasNLP 2021 and 2023 ST In 2021, the AmericasNLP community organized a workshop on Machine Translation for 10 indigenous lan- guages of the Americas in 2021 (Mager et al., 2021) and 2023 (Ebrahimi et al., 2023) with an additional indigenous language (Chatino). The AmericasNLP shared task winner was (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2021) in 2021, and a more mixed result in 20237. Other participants in this shared task are (Nagoudi et al., 2021; Bollmann et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021; Knowles et al., 2021; Parida et al., 2021; Nagoudi et al., 2021).

In most cases, these speakers have been exposed to a colonial past, or to a local oppres- sion, by the majority language and culture. It is important to point to best practices and recom- mendations when performing our research. Bird (2020) and Liu et al. (2022) advocate to include community members as co-authors (Liu et al., 2022) as well as considering data and technology sovereignty.

The product of the research should be available for use by the community, so they can take advantage of the gen- erated materials, like papers, books, or data. 9 Conclusion Machine translation for ILA has gained interest in the NLP community over the last few years.

A more compre- hensive (on the segmentation modeling side) was done by (Mager et al., 2022) exploring a wide array of segmentation models.The latter study showed that supervised morphological segmenta- tion under-perform unsupervised. However, unsu- pervised morphological segmentation like LMVR (Ataman et al., 2017) and FlatCat (Gr\u00f6nroos et al., 2014) perform better than BPEs. (Ngoc Le and Sadat, 2020) studied how better to perform word segmentation for the Inuktitut\u2013English pair. They found that for this language pair, a morphological segmentation, or a combination of BPEs and mor- phological segmentation, works better than just applying vanilla BPEs. Also, training word em- beddings for Guarani\u2013Spanish translation is an excellent opportunity to increase the MT perfor- mance of these languages (G\u00f3ngora et al., 2022). The usage of transfer learning from multilin- gual systems has been tried, with limited re- sults (Nagoudi et al., 2021) (training an own T5 model for indigenous languages) and (Zheng et al., 2021). However, pertaining a Spanish\u2013English model together with ILA, and then fine-tuning it (together with a careful prepossessing and filter- ing step) has been the most successful strategy (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2021). The quality of MT systems of ILA has been a constant debate. However, Ebrahimi et al. (2021) shows that the quality of MT for these languages is enough to improve other tasks like natural lan- guage inference (NLI). Inuktitut\u2013Enlgish ST The WMT 2020 news translation task included Inuktitut\u2013English trans- lation (Barrault et al., 2020). The participating systems explored the difficulties of working with a polysynthetic language in a medium resource scenario. Participating teams in this competi- tion were: (Kocmi, 2020; Hernandez and Nguyen, 2020; Scherrer et al., 2020; Roest et al., 2020; Lo, 2020; Knowles et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020e; Krubi\u00b4nski et al., 2020). AmericasNLP 2021 and 2023 ST In 2021, the AmericasNLP community organized a workshop on Machine Translation for 10 indigenous lan- guages of the Americas in 2021 (Mager et al., 2021) and 2023 (Ebrahimi et al., 2023) with an additional indigenous language (Chatino). The AmericasNLP shared task winner was (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2021) in 2021, and a more mixed result in 20237. Other participants in this shared task are (Nagoudi et al., 2021; Bollmann et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021; Knowles et al., 2021; Parida et al., 2021; Nagoudi et al., 2021).

In most cases, these speakers have been exposed to a colonial past, or to a local oppres- sion, by the majority language and culture. It is important to point to best practices and recom- mendations when performing our research. Bird (2020) and Liu et al. (2022) advocate to include community members as co-authors (Liu et al., 2022) as well as considering data and technology sovereignty. This is also aligned with the com- munity building aimed at by Zhang et al. (2022). Mager et al. (2023) summarizes the main aspects that should be considered as follows: i) Consul- tation, Negotiation and Mutual Understanding. It is important to inform the community about the planned research, negotiating a possible outcome, and reaching a mutual agreement on the direc- tions and details of the project should happen in ii) Respect of the local culture and in- all cases. volvement. As each community has its own cul- ture and view of the world, researchers should be familiar with the history and traditions of the com- munity.

The product of the research should be available for use by the community, so they can take advantage of the gen- erated materials, like papers, books, or data. 9 Conclusion Machine translation for ILA has gained interest in the NLP community over the last few years. Here, we provide an exhaustive overview of the basic MT concepts and the particular challenges for MT for ILA (in the context of low-resource scenarios and its relation to endangered languages).

However, pertaining a Spanish\u2013English model together with ILA, and then fine-tuning it (together with a careful prepossessing and filter- ing step) has been the most successful strategy (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2021). The quality of MT systems of ILA has been a constant debate. However, Ebrahimi et al. (2021) shows that the quality of MT for these languages is enough to improve other tasks like natural lan- guage inference (NLI). Inuktitut\u2013Enlgish ST The WMT 2020 news translation task included Inuktitut\u2013English trans- lation (Barrault et al., 2020). The participating systems explored the difficulties of working with a polysynthetic language in a medium resource scenario. Participating teams in this competi- tion were: (Kocmi, 2020; Hernandez and Nguyen, 2020; Scherrer et al., 2020; Roest et al., 2020; Lo, 2020; Knowles et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020e; Krubi\u00b4nski et al., 2020). AmericasNLP 2021 and 2023 ST In 2021, the AmericasNLP community organized a workshop on Machine Translation for 10 indigenous lan- guages of the Americas in 2021 (Mager et al., 2021) and 2023 (Ebrahimi et al., 2023) with an additional indigenous language (Chatino). The AmericasNLP shared task winner was (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2021) in 2021, and a more mixed result in 20237. Other participants in this shared task are (Nagoudi et al., 2021; Bollmann et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021; Knowles et al., 2021; Parida et al., 2021; Nagoudi et al., 2021). It is impor- tant to point at the importance of clean datata. For Quechua, (Moreno, 2021) got the best results gen- erating an additional amount of clean data. AmericasNLP 2022 Competition is a com- petition on Speech-to-Text translation is or- ganized and is targeting the following lan- guage pairs: Bribri\u2013Spanish, Guaran\u00ed\u2013Spanish, Kotiria\u2013Portuguese, Wa\u2019ikhana\u2013Portuguese, and 7Up to this moment, no official desciption papers for the 2023 are published. Quechua\u2013Spanish (Ebrahim et al., 2023)8. 8 Ethical aspects When working with ILAs are also interacting with communities and nations that speak these lan- guages. In most cases, these speakers have been exposed to a colonial past, or to a local oppres- sion, by the majority language and culture. It is important to point to best practices and recom- mendations when performing our research. Bird (2020) and Liu et al. (2022) advocate to include community members as co-authors (Liu et al., 2022) as well as considering data and technology sovereignty. This is also aligned with the com- munity building aimed at by Zhang et al. (2022). Mager et al. (2023) summarizes the main aspects that should be considered as follows: i) Consul- tation, Negotiation and Mutual Understanding. It is important to inform the community about the planned research, negotiating a possible outcome, and reaching a mutual agreement on the direc- tions and details of the project should happen in ii) Respect of the local culture and in- all cases. volvement. As each community has its own cul- ture and view of the world, researchers should be familiar with the history and traditions of the com- munity. Also, it should be recommended that lo- cal researchers, speakers, or internal governments should be involved in the project. iii) Sharing and distribution of data and research. The product of the research should be available for use by the community, so they can take advantage of the gen- erated materials, like papers, books, or data. 9 Conclusion Machine translation for ILA has gained interest in the NLP community over the last few years. Here, we provide an exhaustive overview of the basic MT concepts and the particular challenges for MT for ILA (in the context of low-resource scenarios and its relation to endangered languages). We ad- ditionally survey the current advances of MT for these languages. Limitations This paper\u2019s aim is to give an introduction to re- searchers, students, of interested community in- digenous community members to the topic of Ma- chine Translation for Indigenous languages of the 8http://turing.iimas.unam.mx/ americasnlp/st.html Americas. Therefore, this paper is not an in-depth survey of the literature on indigenous languages nor a more technical survey of low-resource ma- chine translation. We would point the reader to more specific surveys on these aspects (Haddow et"}, {"question": " What do Bird (2020) and Liu et al. (2022) advocate for when working with ILAs?", "answer": " They advocate for including community members as co-authors and considering data and technology sovereignty.", "ref_chunk": "been successful (Mager and Meza, 2021). However, with the use of LRL MT methods, we have witnessed great improvements. The Cherokee\u2013English (Zhang et al., 2020c) language pair has been explored using a pre- trained BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) for the En- glish side. A system demonstration of this ap- proach is also accessible (Zhang et al., 2021). The back translation strategy for Bribri\u2013Spanish NMT transformers has also been explored (Feldman and Coto-Solano, 2020) and by (Oncevay, 2021) (for four Peruvian languages to Spanish) with good results. The scarce indigenous language mono- lingual text can be replaced to some extent with Spanish text or extracted from PDFs, and other sources (Bustamante et al., 2020). One of the main challenges for the complex morphological languages in the area has been the prepossessing step. Schwartz et al. (2020) show that even if morphological segmentation has less perplexity a the language modeling time, it is still under-performing or equivalent against BPEs for MT (for Inuktitut-\u2013English, Yupik\u2014English Data, Guaran\u00ed\u2014Spanish Data). A more compre- hensive (on the segmentation modeling side) was done by (Mager et al., 2022) exploring a wide array of segmentation models.The latter study showed that supervised morphological segmenta- tion under-perform unsupervised. However, unsu- pervised morphological segmentation like LMVR (Ataman et al., 2017) and FlatCat (Gr\u00f6nroos et al., 2014) perform better than BPEs. (Ngoc Le and Sadat, 2020) studied how better to perform word segmentation for the Inuktitut\u2013English pair. They found that for this language pair, a morphological segmentation, or a combination of BPEs and mor- phological segmentation, works better than just applying vanilla BPEs.
