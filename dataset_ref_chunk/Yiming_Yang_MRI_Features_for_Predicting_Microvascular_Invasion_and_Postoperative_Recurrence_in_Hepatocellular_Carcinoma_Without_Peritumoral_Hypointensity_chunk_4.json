MRI Features for Predicting Intrahepatic Recurrence During a median follow-up period of 11 months (range, 1\u201356 months; IQR, 4\u201320 months), intrahepatic recurrence was diagnosed in 51 patients (39.3%). The median time to intrahepatic recurrence after curative hepatic resection was 7 months (range, 1\u201347 months; IQR, 3\u201313 months). Kaplan\u2013Meier curves showed that intrahepatic RFS was shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity than in those without (Figure 3, P<0.001). After adjusting potential confounders of age, gender, tumor size, and other radiological features, peritumoral HBP hypointensity (HR: 2.381, 95% CI: 1.162\u20134.881, P=0.018) remained significantly associated with shorter intrahepatic RFS (Table S4). 1602 Journal of Hepatocellular Carcinoma 2023:10 https://doi.org/10.2147/JHC.S422632 DovePress Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Dovepress Chen et al Figure 3 Kaplan\u2013Meier curves showing recurrence-free survival in patients with and without peritumoral hepatobiliary phase hypointensity.

However, only satellite nodule (HR: 3.324, 95% CI: 1.733\u20136.378, P<0.001) was identified as an independent prognostic factor for intrahepatic RFS in multivariate Cox regression analysis (Table 5).

Discussion The findings of this study confirm that peritumoral HBP hypointensity is an important MRI feature that can be used to preoperatively predict pathological MVI and shorter intrahepatic RFS and that the presence of a radiological capsule can help to predict MVI status in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. However, only the presence of satellite nodule was identified as an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS in this subgroup after univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Previous studies have established that the presence of MVI is one of the key factors in early recurrence of HCC and poor outcomes after curative liver resection or liver transplantation.13 Preoperative assessment of MVI is important for accurate selection of candidates for the various treatment options.

Discussion The findings of this study confirm that peritumoral HBP hypointensity is an important MRI feature that can be used to preoperatively predict pathological MVI and shorter intrahepatic RFS and that the presence of a radiological capsule can help to predict MVI status in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. However, only the presence of satellite nodule was identified as an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS in this subgroup after univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.

After adjusting potential confounders of age, gender, tumor size, and other radiological features, peritumoral HBP hypointensity (HR: 2.381, 95% CI: 1.162\u20134.881, P=0.018) remained significantly associated with shorter intrahepatic RFS (Table S4). 1602 Journal of Hepatocellular Carcinoma 2023:10 https://doi.org/10.2147/JHC.S422632 DovePress Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Dovepress Chen et al Figure 3 Kaplan\u2013Meier curves showing recurrence-free survival in patients with and without peritumoral hepatobiliary phase hypointensity.

The median time to intrahepatic recurrence after curative hepatic resection was 7 months (range, 1\u201347 months; IQR, 3\u201313 months). Kaplan\u2013Meier curves showed that intrahepatic RFS was shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity than in those without (Figure 3, P<0.001). After adjusting potential confounders of age, gender, tumor size, and other radiological features, peritumoral HBP hypointensity (HR: 2.381, 95% CI: 1.162\u20134.881, P=0.018) remained significantly associated with shorter intrahepatic RFS (Table S4). 1602 Journal of Hepatocellular Carcinoma 2023:10 https://doi.org/10.2147/JHC.S422632 DovePress Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Dovepress Chen et al Figure 3 Kaplan\u2013Meier curves showing recurrence-free survival in patients with and without peritumoral hepatobiliary phase hypointensity. In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, subgroup analysis showed that tumor size >5 cm (P=0.001), non- smooth margins (P=0.040), mosaic sign (P=0.040), necrosis (P=0.009), and satellite nodule (P<0.001) were prognostic factors for intrahepatic RFS. However, only satellite nodule (HR: 3.324, 95% CI: 1.733\u20136.378, P<0.001) was identified as an independent prognostic factor for intrahepatic RFS in multivariate Cox regression analysis (Table 5). As shown in Figure 4, intrahepatic RFS was similar in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity who had satellite nodule to that in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity (P=0.693).

MRI Features for Predicting Intrahepatic Recurrence During a median follow-up period of 11 months (range, 1\u201356 months; IQR, 4\u201320 months), intrahepatic recurrence was diagnosed in 51 patients (39.3%). The median time to intrahepatic recurrence after curative hepatic resection was 7 months (range, 1\u201347 months; IQR, 3\u201313 months). Kaplan\u2013Meier curves showed that intrahepatic RFS was shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity than in those without (Figure 3, P<0.001). After adjusting potential confounders of age, gender, tumor size, and other radiological features, peritumoral HBP hypointensity (HR: 2.381, 95% CI: 1.162\u20134.881, P=0.018) remained significantly associated with shorter intrahepatic RFS (Table S4). 1602 Journal of Hepatocellular Carcinoma 2023:10 https://doi.org/10.2147/JHC.S422632 DovePress Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Dovepress Chen et al Figure 3 Kaplan\u2013Meier curves showing recurrence-free survival in patients with and without peritumoral hepatobiliary phase hypointensity. In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, subgroup analysis showed that tumor size >5 cm (P=0.001), non- smooth margins (P=0.040), mosaic sign (P=0.040), necrosis (P=0.009), and satellite nodule (P<0.001) were prognostic factors for intrahepatic RFS. However, only satellite nodule (HR: 3.324, 95% CI: 1.733\u20136.378, P<0.001) was identified as an independent prognostic factor for intrahepatic RFS in multivariate Cox regression analysis (Table 5). As shown in Figure 4, intrahepatic RFS was similar in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity who had satellite nodule to that in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity (P=0.693).

Discussion The findings of this study confirm that peritumoral HBP hypointensity is an important MRI feature that can be used to preoperatively predict pathological MVI and shorter intrahepatic RFS and that the presence of a radiological capsule can help to predict MVI status in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. However, only the presence of satellite nodule was identified as an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS in this subgroup after univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Previous studies have established that the presence of MVI is one of the key factors in early recurrence of HCC and poor outcomes after curative liver resection or liver transplantation.13 Preoperative assessment of MVI is important for accurate selection of candidates for the various treatment options.

HBP images (b) for a 50-year- old male patient showing multiple satellite nodules (arrow) around the tumor without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Tumor recurrence was detected 4 months after curative resection. as high-risk for intrahepatic recurrence, which was a significant improvement when compared with peritumoral HBP hypointensity alone (P<0.001). Discussion The findings of this study confirm that peritumoral HBP hypointensity is an important MRI feature that can be used to preoperatively predict pathological MVI and shorter intrahepatic RFS and that the presence of a radiological capsule can help to predict MVI status in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. However, only the presence of satellite nodule was identified as an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS in this subgroup after univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Previous studies have established that the presence of MVI is one of the key factors in early recurrence of HCC and poor outcomes after curative liver resection or liver transplantation.13 Preoperative assessment of MVI is important for accurate selection of candidates for the various treatment options. For example, studies in which MVI status was 1604 Journal of Hepatocellular Carcinoma 2023:10 https://doi.org/10.2147/JHC.S422632 DovePress Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Dovepress Chen et al Figure 6 Two stepwise flowchart incorporating peritumoral hepatobiliary phase hypointensity and satellite nodule"}
