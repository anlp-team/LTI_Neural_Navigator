Restricted cubic spline was applied this study was the discovery of a threshold effect on the linear relationship between AGR and OS. The inflection point we calculated by the recursive algorithm was 1.24. The results showed that not all levels of AGR correlated with OS. Only when AGR level was higher than 1.24, the risk of death was significantly reduced by 80% for every 1 unit increase in AGR. This means that only when Page 8 of 10 Fig. 3 Kaplan-Meier survival curves for overall survival were compared among different AGR groups Fig. 4 Subgroup analysis of the association between AGR and overall survival Page 9 of 10 inflammation improves to a certain level or immune status improves to a certain level does the risk of death correspondingly reduced. When AGR falls below 1.24, it may not exhibit a significant independent association with OS in advanced NSCLC patients receiving anlo- tinib treatment. One possible explanation for this result is that when AGR is lower than 1.24, it may reflect a state of compromised liver function, which is often associated with advanced stages of lung cancer. In such cases, there are likely multiple indicators and factors contributing to the prognosis of patients, and the influence of AGR alone may be diminished. Further studies to find suitable prog- nostic factors in those specific patients are needed. needed. Forth, the small sample size may have affected the statistical power and generalizability of our find- ings. It is important to interpret the results with caution and recognize that they may not be representative of the larger population of patients with advanced lung can- cer. Furthermore, the patient characteristics and treat- ment modalities in our study may not fully represent the heterogeneity seen in the overall population of patients with advanced lung cancer. Therefore, caution should be exercised when extrapolating our results to other patient cohorts or making clinical decisions solely based on our findings. Subgroup analysis is quite important for a scientific study. This analysis will help us to better understand the independent association of AGR and OS from known risk factors. In the present study, we used age, gender, never smoker, hypertension, EGFR mutation, histology, tumor stage, ECOG PS score, number of metastases, number of previous treatment lines, number of previous chemotherapy lines, previous targeted therapy, previous radiotherapy, previous immunotherapy, anlotinib mono- therapy, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelets as stratification variables, of which only ECOG PS score was identified. Hence, our study demonstrated that the linearly decreasing trend between AGR and risk of death occurred only in participants with ECOG PS score = 0 group. One possible explanation is that patients with ECOG PS score = 1 in our study had a higher number of metastases (Supplement Table 1), indicating that they may have higher tumor burden, which is generally associ- ated with worse outcomes in cancer patients. And there may be multiple factors contributing to the prognosis of this group of patients, which may need further study with larger sample size to elucidate. Conclusions The relationship between AGR and OS for advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib is non-linear. AGR is positively correlated with OS when AGR is higher than 1.24. These findings further expand the poten- tial role of AGR as a prognostic predictor in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib.

In such cases, there are likely multiple indicators and factors contributing to the prognosis of patients, and the influence of AGR alone may be diminished. Further studies to find suitable prog- nostic factors in those specific patients are needed. needed. Forth, the small sample size may have affected the statistical power and generalizability of our find- ings. It is important to interpret the results with caution and recognize that they may not be representative of the larger population of patients with advanced lung can- cer. Furthermore, the patient characteristics and treat- ment modalities in our study may not fully represent the heterogeneity seen in the overall population of patients with advanced lung cancer. Therefore, caution should be exercised when extrapolating our results to other patient cohorts or making clinical decisions solely based on our findings. Subgroup analysis is quite important for a scientific study. This analysis will help us to better understand the independent association of AGR and OS from known risk factors. In the present study, we used age, gender, never smoker, hypertension, EGFR mutation, histology, tumor stage, ECOG PS score, number of metastases, number of previous treatment lines, number of previous chemotherapy lines, previous targeted therapy, previous radiotherapy, previous immunotherapy, anlotinib mono- therapy, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelets as stratification variables, of which only ECOG PS score was identified. Hence, our study demonstrated that the linearly decreasing trend between AGR and risk of death occurred only in participants with ECOG PS score = 0 group. One possible explanation is that patients with ECOG PS score = 1 in our study had a higher number of metastases (Supplement Table 1), indicating that they may have higher tumor burden, which is generally associ- ated with worse outcomes in cancer patients. And there may be multiple factors contributing to the prognosis of this group of patients, which may need further study with larger sample size to elucidate. Conclusions The relationship between AGR and OS for advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib is non-linear. AGR is positively correlated with OS when AGR is higher than 1.24. These findings further expand the poten- tial role of AGR as a prognostic predictor in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib.

Restricted cubic spline was applied this study was the discovery of a threshold effect on the linear relationship between AGR and OS. The inflection point we calculated by the recursive algorithm was 1.24. The results showed that not all levels of AGR correlated with OS. Only when AGR level was higher than 1.24, the risk of death was significantly reduced by 80% for every 1 unit increase in AGR. This means that only when Page 8 of 10 Fig. 3 Kaplan-Meier survival curves for overall survival were compared among different AGR groups Fig. 4 Subgroup analysis of the association between AGR and overall survival Page 9 of 10 inflammation improves to a certain level or immune status improves to a certain level does the risk of death correspondingly reduced. When AGR falls below 1.24, it may not exhibit a significant independent association with OS in advanced NSCLC patients receiving anlo- tinib treatment. One possible explanation for this result is that when AGR is lower than 1.24, it may reflect a state of compromised liver function, which is often associated with advanced stages of lung cancer. In such cases, there are likely multiple indicators and factors contributing to the prognosis of patients, and the influence of AGR alone may be diminished. Further studies to find suitable prog- nostic factors in those specific patients are needed. needed. Forth, the small sample size may have affected the statistical power and generalizability of our find- ings. It is important to interpret the results with caution and recognize that they may not be representative of the larger population of patients with advanced lung can- cer. Furthermore, the patient characteristics and treat- ment modalities in our study may not fully represent the heterogeneity seen in the overall population of patients with advanced lung cancer. Therefore, caution should be exercised when extrapolating our results to other patient cohorts or making clinical decisions solely based on our findings. Subgroup analysis is quite important for a scientific study. This analysis will help us to better understand the independent association of AGR and OS from known risk factors. In the present study, we used age, gender, never smoker, hypertension, EGFR mutation, histology, tumor stage, ECOG PS score, number of metastases, number of previous treatment lines, number of previous chemotherapy lines, previous targeted therapy, previous radiotherapy, previous immunotherapy, anlotinib mono- therapy, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelets as stratification variables, of which only ECOG PS score was identified. Hence, our study demonstrated that the linearly decreasing trend between AGR and risk of death occurred only in participants with ECOG PS score = 0 group. One possible explanation is that patients with ECOG PS score = 1 in our study had a higher number of metastases (Supplement Table 1), indicating that they may have higher tumor burden, which is generally associ- ated with worse outcomes in cancer patients. And there may be multiple factors contributing to the prognosis of this group of patients, which may need further study with larger sample size to elucidate. Conclusions The relationship between AGR and OS for advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib is non-linear. AGR is positively correlated with OS when AGR is higher than 1.24. These findings further expand the poten- tial role of AGR as a prognostic predictor in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib.
