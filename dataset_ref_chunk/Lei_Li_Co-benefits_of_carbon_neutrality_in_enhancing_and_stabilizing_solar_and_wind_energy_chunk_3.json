For regions with decreased solar PVPOT (Fig. 1a), contributions from tem- perature (increasing; Extended Data Fig. 2a) and surface downwelling shortwave radiation (decreasing; Extended Data Fig. 2b) are in the same direction and generally comparable in southern South America, India and western Africa, but a dominant contribution from the increasing temperature is found in the western United States. In contrast to the governing factors for solar PVPOT changes under SSP2-4.5, surface downwelling shortwave radiation (Fig. 2d,g), not temperature (Fig. 2e,h), contributes most of the enhanced solar PVPOT in Asia (especially in eastern China and India) under carbon-neutral scenarios (MOD and STR) relative to the baseline scenario. The surface downwelling shortwave radiation increased notably in Asia under the carbon-neutral scenarios (Extended Data Fig. 2d,f), which improves solar energy harvesting. It is well known that surface downwelling shortwave radiation is primarily influenced by clouds and aerosol loadings38\u201341. We note that aerosol optical depth shows a large decline by 30\u201340% in eastern China and India during 2040\u20132049 under two carbon-neutral scenarios relative to SSP2-4.5 (Supplementary Fig. 2b,d). In contrast, a slight increase in cloud fraction is found over the same regions (Supplementary Fig. 2a,c). Therefore, the aerosol optical depth decrease due to sharp aerosol emission reductions in the carbon-neutral scenarios is the dominant factor driving the large increase in solar PVPOT in Asia.

Such a strong interhemi- spheric asymmetry response of WP to future warming was also identi- fied by another recent study21, which attributed the decreased WP in the northern mid-high latitudes to polar amplification and the increased WP in the tropics and the southern subtropics to enhanced land\u2013sea thermal gradients.

In contrast to the governing factors for solar PVPOT changes under SSP2-4.5, surface downwelling shortwave radiation (Fig. 2d,g), not temperature (Fig. 2e,h), contributes most of the enhanced solar PVPOT in Asia (especially in eastern China and India) under carbon-neutral scenarios (MOD and STR) relative to the baseline scenario.

The main feature of WP changes under deep miti- gation scenarios is a west-to-east shift, instead of the north-to-south shift as noted in Fig. 3a. That is, in Asia, especially in eastern China but broadly in South Asia and northern Eurasia, the increase in WP during 2040\u20132049 relative to the historical period is further enhanced from 2% in SSP2-4.5 to 3% in the moderate carbon-neutral scenario (MOD) and 5% in the strong carbon-neutral scenario (STR). In contrast, the increase in WP in western Africa during 2040\u20132049 is reduced from 6% in SSP2-4.5 to 3% in the STR scenario (Fig. 3d). Such a major shift of wind energy resources towards Asia in the mid-twenty-first century driven by global carbon-neutral policies can be found more clearly from the absolute changes (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c), which consider the spatial heterogeneity of actual WP output (Supplementary Fig. 4). The changes in wind power density (WPD) also broadly match the spatial pattern of WP response to the carbon-neutral policies, only with slightly smaller magnitude (Extended Data Fig. 4). day below cut-in wind speed is increased, but days with ramp-up wind speeds are decreased. Our findings reveal the critical role of shifts between cut-in and ramp-up wind speeds, rather than days with opti- mal conditions (rated-power wind speed of 11\u201325 m s\u22121), in governing future WP changes. Note that the WP results are presented here with an illustrative wind turbine and the results may change quantitatively for other types of turbine with different (ideally lower) cut-in wind speed."}, {"question": " In which regions do we see a major shift of wind energy resources towards Asia driven by global carbon-neutral policies?", "answer": " Asia, especially in eastern China, South Asia, and northern Eurasia", "ref_chunk": "contribu- tions from temperature because a warmer solar panel is less effective in converting solar energy into electricity (Extended Data Fig. 2a). For regions with decreased solar PVPOT (Fig. 1a), contributions from tem- perature (increasing; Extended Data Fig. 2a) and surface downwelling shortwave radiation (decreasing; Extended Data Fig. 2b) are in the same direction and generally comparable in southern South America, India and western Africa, but a dominant contribution from the increasing temperature is found in the western United States. In contrast to the governing factors for solar PVPOT changes under SSP2-4.5, surface downwelling shortwave radiation (Fig. 2d,g), not temperature (Fig. 2e,h), contributes most of the enhanced solar PVPOT in Asia (especially in eastern China and India) under carbon-neutral scenarios (MOD and STR) relative to the baseline scenario. The surface downwelling shortwave radiation increased notably in Asia under the carbon-neutral scenarios (Extended Data Fig. 2d,f), which improves solar energy harvesting. It is well known that surface downwelling shortwave radiation is primarily influenced by clouds and aerosol loadings38\u201341.
