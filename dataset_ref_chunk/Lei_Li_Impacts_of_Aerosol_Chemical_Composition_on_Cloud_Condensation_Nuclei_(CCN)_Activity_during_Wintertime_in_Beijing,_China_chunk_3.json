The \u03bb = 880 nm is chosen to avoid the potential interference of brown carbon at shorter wavelength. The multi-scattering enhancement factor (C value) of 2.88 at 880nm wavelength was used to exclude the multiple light scattering effects. In addition, PM2.5 mass concentration data from air quality monitoring station (Wanliu) operated by the Beijing Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau were used, which is located in the northwest and northeast direction of the CAMS observation site, with a distance of approximately 3 km. The concurrent meteorological parameters (including wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and air temperature) are from the national surface meteorological observation stations of the China Meteorological Administration. 2.3. Data Processing 2.3.1. CCN Activation The NCN and NCCN data were used to calculate the size-resolved CCN activation ratio (AR), which de\ufb01ned as the ratio of NCCN to NCN at each particle size (NCCN/NCN vs. Dp). The in\ufb02uence of multiple-charge particles and DMA transfer function on AR were corrected basing on a modi\ufb01ed algorithm developed by Hagen and Alofs (1983) [44] and Deng et al. (2011, 2013) [25,45]. Figure S1 gives a typical example of NCCN/NCN vs. Dp during the experiment, and the AR curve can be obtained by \ufb01tting the NCCN/NCN ratio with the sigmoidal function: AR = a + b/(1 + exp ( D50 \u2212 Dp \u03c3s )) where a is the offset from 0 in the y direction and b is the height of the upper plateau of the sigmoid function, D50 is the critical diameter, and \u03c3s is a measure for the width of the sigmoid function. D50 is also called the critical diameter or the activation diameter, that is, the diameter at which 50% of the particles are activated at a speci\ufb01c SS. The variation in D50 at a given SS can be attributed to the variation in the number fraction of hygroscopic particles or its hygroscopicity, which can be indicated the CCN activity of a particle population. Then, the hygroscopicity parameter \u03baCCN, derived from CCN measurements, is calculated from the critical supersaturation ratio (Sc) and D50 from the following equation [13]: \u03baCCN = 4A3 50(lnSc)2 , 27D3 A = 4\u03c3s/a Mw RT\u03c1w where \u03c3s/a is the surface tension of the solution/air interface and the solution is temporarily assumed to be pure water (0.0728 N m\u22121 at 298.15 K), Mw is the molecular weight of water, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol\u22121 K\u22121), T is absolute temperature, \u03c1w is the density of water. The steepness of the AR curve represents the degree of external mixture or the heterogeneity of aerosol chemical composition, which can be quanti\ufb01ed by the ratio of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 [46]. D75 and D25 correspond to the diameters at which 75% and 25% of the particles are activated on the AR curve. Internal mixture implies that particles at any given dry size have equal \u03ba with (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 = 0. Alternatively, various \u03ba at a given particle size indicate externally mixed aerosol compositions with higher (D75 \u2212 D25)/Dc values. Although the sigma term from sigmoid \ufb01t has been used in previous studies to estimate aerosol mixing state [19,30], the (D75 \u2212 D25) value can provide a more accurate representation of aerosol mixing state. This is because the CCN measurement uncertainties would be larger due to the extremely low concentration of activated particles at the low 4 of 15 (1) (2) Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 AR range. In addition, the relationship between activation ratio and particle size exhibits nonlinear behavior when AR < 25% or >75% (Figure S1). In contrast, within the particle size range of D25 to D75, the AR increases rapidly and exhibits a relatively linear relationship with the particle size. The sigma term represents the width of entire particle diameter range used in sigmoid \ufb01t. Instead of the sigma term, using the (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 value to describe the steepness of the AR curve can reduce the uncertainties in estimating aerosol mixing state. 2.3.2. Aerosol Hygroscopicity Derived from Aerosol Chemical Composition The hygroscopic parameter \u03ba is solely determined by composition and re\ufb02ects the Raoult term in K\u00f6hler theory [13]. By assuming internal mixing, the aerosol hygroscopic- ity (\u03bachem) can be derived from aerosol chemical composition measurements. The \u03bachem of aerosol particles with multiple compositions is contributed by the \u03ba of each volume- weighted composition, following the Zdanovskii\u2013Stokes\u2013Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule [28], expressed as: \u03bachem = \u2211 i \u03b5i\u03bai where i represents the ith composition, \u03b5i is the volume fraction of each composition in the bulk, and ki is the hygroscopic parameter for each composition present in a multiple- composition particle. For the compositions determined by ACSM the AE33 measurements, a simple ion-pairing scheme [9] was used in this study, expressed as: nNH4 NO3 nH2SO4 nNH4 HSO4 n(NH4)2SO4 nHNO3 = nNO\u2212 3 (cid:16) = max (cid:16) 0, nSO2\u2212 2nSO2\u2212 (cid:16) 0, nNH+ 4 = min 4 = max = 0 4 (cid:17) \u2212 nNH+ \u2212 nNH+ \u2212 nNO\u2212 + nNO\u2212 + nNO\u2212 (cid:17) 4 3 , nNH+ 4 3 4 3 \u2212 nNO\u2212 3 (cid:17) All species are then converted to volume by assuming a density.

The \u03bb = 880 nm is chosen to avoid the potential interference of brown carbon at shorter wavelength. The multi-scattering enhancement factor (C value) of 2.88 at 880nm wavelength was used to exclude the multiple light scattering effects. In addition, PM2.5 mass concentration data from air quality monitoring station (Wanliu) operated by the Beijing Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau were used, which is located in the northwest and northeast direction of the CAMS observation site, with a distance of approximately 3 km. The concurrent meteorological parameters (including wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and air temperature) are from the national surface meteorological observation stations of the China Meteorological Administration. 2.3. Data Processing 2.3.1. CCN Activation The NCN and NCCN data were used to calculate the size-resolved CCN activation ratio (AR), which de\ufb01ned as the ratio of NCCN to NCN at each particle size (NCCN/NCN vs. Dp). The in\ufb02uence of multiple-charge particles and DMA transfer function on AR were corrected basing on a modi\ufb01ed algorithm developed by Hagen and Alofs (1983) [44] and Deng et al. (2011, 2013) [25,45]. Figure S1 gives a typical example of NCCN/NCN vs. Dp during the experiment, and the AR curve can be obtained by \ufb01tting the NCCN/NCN ratio with the sigmoidal function: AR = a + b/(1 + exp ( D50 \u2212 Dp \u03c3s )) where a is the offset from 0 in the y direction and b is the height of the upper plateau of the sigmoid function, D50 is the critical diameter, and \u03c3s is a measure for the width of the sigmoid function. D50 is also called the critical diameter or the activation diameter, that is, the diameter at which 50% of the particles are activated at a speci\ufb01c SS. The variation in D50 at a given SS can be attributed to the variation in the number fraction of hygroscopic particles or its hygroscopicity, which can be indicated the CCN activity of a particle population. Then, the hygroscopicity parameter \u03baCCN, derived from CCN measurements, is calculated from the critical supersaturation ratio (Sc) and D50 from the following equation [13]: \u03baCCN = 4A3 50(lnSc)2 , 27D3 A = 4\u03c3s/a Mw RT\u03c1w where \u03c3s/a is the surface tension of the solution/air interface and the solution is temporarily assumed to be pure water (0.0728 N m\u22121 at 298.15 K), Mw is the molecular weight of water, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol\u22121 K\u22121), T is absolute temperature, \u03c1w is the density of water. The steepness of the AR curve represents the degree of external mixture or the heterogeneity of aerosol chemical composition, which can be quanti\ufb01ed by the ratio of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 [46]. D75 and D25 correspond to the diameters at which 75% and 25% of the particles are activated on the AR curve. Internal mixture implies that particles at any given dry size have equal \u03ba with (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 = 0. Alternatively, various \u03ba at a given particle size indicate externally mixed aerosol compositions with higher (D75 \u2212 D25)/Dc values. Although the sigma term from sigmoid \ufb01t has been used in previous studies to estimate aerosol mixing state [19,30], the (D75 \u2212 D25) value can provide a more accurate representation of aerosol mixing state. This is because the CCN measurement uncertainties would be larger due to the extremely low concentration of activated particles at the low 4 of 15 (1) (2) Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 AR range. In addition, the relationship between activation ratio and particle size exhibits nonlinear behavior when AR < 25% or >75% (Figure S1). In contrast, within the particle size range of D25 to D75, the AR increases rapidly and exhibits a relatively linear relationship with the particle size. The sigma term represents the width of entire particle diameter range used in sigmoid \ufb01t. Instead of the sigma term, using the (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 value to describe the steepness of the AR curve can reduce the uncertainties in estimating aerosol mixing state. 2.3.2. Aerosol Hygroscopicity Derived from Aerosol Chemical Composition The hygroscopic parameter \u03ba is solely determined by composition and re\ufb02ects the Raoult term in K\u00f6hler theory [13]. By assuming internal mixing, the aerosol hygroscopic- ity (\u03bachem) can be derived from aerosol chemical composition measurements. The \u03bachem of aerosol particles with multiple compositions is contributed by the \u03ba of each volume- weighted composition, following the Zdanovskii\u2013Stokes\u2013Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule [28], expressed as: \u03bachem = \u2211 i \u03b5i\u03bai where i represents the ith composition, \u03b5i is the volume fraction of each composition in the bulk, and ki is the hygroscopic parameter for each composition present in a multiple- composition particle. For the compositions determined by ACSM the AE33 measurements, a simple ion-pairing scheme [9] was used in this study, expressed as: nNH4 NO3 nH2SO4 nNH4 HSO4 n(NH4)2SO4 nHNO3 = nNO\u2212 3 (cid:16) = max (cid:16) 0, nSO2\u2212 2nSO2\u2212 (cid:16) 0, nNH+ 4 = min 4 = max = 0 4 (cid:17) \u2212 nNH+ \u2212 nNH+ \u2212 nNO\u2212 + nNO\u2212 + nNO\u2212 (cid:17) 4 3 , nNH+ 4 3 4 3 \u2212 nNO\u2212 3 (cid:17) All species are then converted to volume by assuming a density.

The \u03bb = 880 nm is chosen to avoid the potential interference of brown carbon at shorter wavelength. The multi-scattering enhancement factor (C value) of 2.88 at 880nm wavelength was used to exclude the multiple light scattering effects. In addition, PM2.5 mass concentration data from air quality monitoring station (Wanliu) operated by the Beijing Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau were used, which is located in the northwest and northeast direction of the CAMS observation site, with a distance of approximately 3 km. The concurrent meteorological parameters (including wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and air temperature) are from the national surface meteorological observation stations of the China Meteorological Administration. 2.3. Data Processing 2.3.1. CCN Activation The NCN and NCCN data were used to calculate the size-resolved CCN activation ratio (AR), which de\ufb01ned as the ratio of NCCN to NCN at each particle size (NCCN/NCN vs. Dp). The in\ufb02uence of multiple-charge particles and DMA transfer function on AR were corrected basing on a modi\ufb01ed algorithm developed by Hagen and Alofs (1983) [44] and Deng et al. (2011, 2013) [25,45]. Figure S1 gives a typical example of NCCN/NCN vs. Dp during the experiment, and the AR curve can be obtained by \ufb01tting the NCCN/NCN ratio with the sigmoidal function: AR = a + b/(1 + exp ( D50 \u2212 Dp \u03c3s )) where a is the offset from 0 in the y direction and b is the height of the upper plateau of the sigmoid function, D50 is the critical diameter, and \u03c3s is a measure for the width of the sigmoid function. D50 is also called the critical diameter or the activation diameter, that is, the diameter at which 50% of the particles are activated at a speci\ufb01c SS. The variation in D50 at a given SS can be attributed to the variation in the number fraction of hygroscopic particles or its hygroscopicity, which can be indicated the CCN activity of a particle population. Then, the hygroscopicity parameter \u03baCCN, derived from CCN measurements, is calculated from the critical supersaturation ratio (Sc) and D50 from the following equation [13]: \u03baCCN = 4A3 50(lnSc)2 , 27D3 A = 4\u03c3s/a Mw RT\u03c1w where \u03c3s/a is the surface tension of the solution/air interface and the solution is temporarily assumed to be pure water (0.0728 N m\u22121 at 298.15 K), Mw is the molecular weight of water, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol\u22121 K\u22121), T is absolute temperature, \u03c1w is the density of water. The steepness of the AR curve represents the degree of external mixture or the heterogeneity of aerosol chemical composition, which can be quanti\ufb01ed by the ratio of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 [46]. D75 and D25 correspond to the diameters at which 75% and 25% of the particles are activated on the AR curve. Internal mixture implies that particles at any given dry size have equal \u03ba with (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 = 0. Alternatively, various \u03ba at a given particle size indicate externally mixed aerosol compositions with higher (D75 \u2212 D25)/Dc values. Although the sigma term from sigmoid \ufb01t has been used in previous studies to estimate aerosol mixing state [19,30], the (D75 \u2212 D25) value can provide a more accurate representation of aerosol mixing state. This is because the CCN measurement uncertainties would be larger due to the extremely low concentration of activated particles at the low 4 of 15 (1) (2) Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 AR range. In addition, the relationship between activation ratio and particle size exhibits nonlinear behavior when AR < 25% or >75% (Figure S1). In contrast, within the particle size range of D25 to D75, the AR increases rapidly and exhibits a relatively linear relationship with the particle size. The sigma term represents the width of entire particle diameter range used in sigmoid \ufb01t. Instead of the sigma term, using the (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 value to describe the steepness of the AR curve can reduce the uncertainties in estimating aerosol mixing state. 2.3.2. Aerosol Hygroscopicity Derived from Aerosol Chemical Composition The hygroscopic parameter \u03ba is solely determined by composition and re\ufb02ects the Raoult term in K\u00f6hler theory [13]. By assuming internal mixing, the aerosol hygroscopic- ity (\u03bachem) can be derived from aerosol chemical composition measurements. The \u03bachem of aerosol particles with multiple compositions is contributed by the \u03ba of each volume- weighted composition, following the Zdanovskii\u2013Stokes\u2013Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule [28], expressed as: \u03bachem = \u2211 i \u03b5i\u03bai where i represents the ith composition, \u03b5i is the volume fraction of each composition in the bulk, and ki is the hygroscopic parameter for each composition present in a multiple- composition particle. For the compositions determined by ACSM the AE33 measurements, a simple ion-pairing scheme [9] was used in this study, expressed as: nNH4 NO3 nH2SO4 nNH4 HSO4 n(NH4)2SO4 nHNO3 = nNO\u2212 3 (cid:16) = max (cid:16) 0, nSO2\u2212 2nSO2\u2212 (cid:16) 0, nNH+ 4 = min 4 = max = 0 4 (cid:17) \u2212 nNH+ \u2212 nNH+ \u2212 nNO\u2212 + nNO\u2212 + nNO\u2212 (cid:17) 4 3 , nNH+ 4 3 4 3 \u2212 nNO\u2212 3 (cid:17) All species are then converted to volume by assuming a density.
