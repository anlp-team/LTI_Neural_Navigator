The carrier gas \ufb02ow rate is maintained at 100 mL/min for 20\u201325 min until the end. 3.2.3. Data Processing Conditions Preliminary analysis: Use the VOCal analysis software that comes with the FlavourSpec\u00ae \ufb02avor analyzer. The VOCal software can be used to analyze the spectra output from the instrument and perform qualitative and quantitative data analysis. The built-in IMS and NIST databases can be used to compare and qualitatively identify volatile substances. After establishing a standard curve for the identi\ufb01ed substances, quantitative analysis can be per- formed. The database is equipped with three plug-ins: Reporter, Gallery Plot, and Dynamic PCA. The Reporter plug-in can directly compare spectral differences in two-dimensional, three-dimensional and other aspects; the Gallery Plot plug-in can compare the output \ufb01ngerprint spectra and quantitatively and intuitively compare the differences in volatile substances between different samples; the Dynamic PCA plug-in can perform dynamic prin- cipal component analysis and similarity analysis to quickly identify unknown samples [22]. Quantitative calculation of chemical components: Ci = Cis \u00d7 Ai Ais Ci is the calculated mass concentration of the chemical component, in \u00b5g/L; Cis is the mass concentration of the internal standard substance. The internal standard substance used in the experiment is 4-methyl-2-pentanol, with a concentration of 198 \u00b5g/L; Ai is the signal peak volume of the chemical component; Ais is the signal peak volume of the internal standard substance. 3.2.4. OAV Value Analysis The OAV analysis method will be used to analyze and screen the main aroma compo- nents. The calculation of the OAV value is related to the threshold value of the main aroma component itself. The selection of the threshold value mainly refers to the book \u201cODOUR THRESHOLDS\u201d. Due to different years and different statistical methods, there may be differences in the same substance. The principle for selecting the threshold value in this experiment is: the air threshold value is selected for Schisandra dried fruit, and the water threshold value is selected for Schisandra branch exudate. All threshold values are selected from the latest data (odor thresholds: compilations of odor threshold values in air, water and other media). Calculation of OAV value: OAV = C OT C\u2014the amount of substance, in units of mg/m3 (in air), mg/kg (in water); OT\u2014the threshold value of the substance itself. 14 of 16 (1) (2) Molecules 2023, 28, 6865 3.2.5. OPLS-DA Analysis OPLS-DA analysis, also known as orthogonal partial least squares discriminant anal- ysis, is used to observe the clustering of samples based on principal component analysis (PCA) data analysis. The OPLS-DA analysis model is then used to screen VIP values, identify differential variables, and locate key differential volatile substances. This part was used by SIMCA and SPSS. 4. Conclusions This study applied GC-IMS technology for the \ufb01rst time to analyze volatile chemical substances in Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit of different colors. The volatile substance \ufb01ngerprint of white-, yellow-, and red-fruit Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit was established. This \ufb01ngerprint can effectively distinguish Schisandra chinensis dried fruit and branch exudates of different colors and can be directly used for quality characteristic evaluation and germplasm identi\ufb01cation. Different algorithms, such as PCA-X, one-way ANOVA, OPLS-DA, and OAV were used to compare and analyze the volatile components of Schisandra chinensis. The results showed significant differences in content among the aroma components of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit. The content and number of high-content types of aroma components in Schisandra chinensis dried fruit are higher than those in branch exudate sam- ples. Comparing between different fruit colors, it was found that the aroma composition of white fruit and yellow fruit Schisandra chinensis is closer, with red fruit Schisandra chinensis signi\ufb01cantly different from yellow fruit and white fruit. The experiment screened out key volatile chemical substances of dried fruits and branch exudates through VIP value and p value joint screening. The key volatile substances of overripe fruits are more abundant than those of branch exudates, with complex composi- tion and signi\ufb01cant differences. These \ufb01ndings highlight the importance of considering both plant part and maturity stage in analyzing volatile components, providing valuable insights for future research in plant chemistry.

This \ufb01ngerprint can effectively distinguish Schisandra chinensis dried fruit and branch exudates of different colors and can be directly used for quality characteristic evaluation and germplasm identi\ufb01cation. Different algorithms, such as PCA-X, one-way ANOVA, OPLS-DA, and OAV were used to compare and analyze the volatile components of Schisandra chinensis. The results showed significant differences in content among the aroma components of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit. The content and number of high-content types of aroma components in Schisandra chinensis dried fruit are higher than those in branch exudate sam- ples. Comparing between different fruit colors, it was found that the aroma composition of white fruit and yellow fruit Schisandra chinensis is closer, with red fruit Schisandra chinensis signi\ufb01cantly different from yellow fruit and white fruit. The experiment screened out key volatile chemical substances of dried fruits and branch exudates through VIP value and p value joint screening. The key volatile substances of overripe fruits are more abundant than those of branch exudates, with complex composi- tion and signi\ufb01cant differences. These \ufb01ndings highlight the importance of considering both plant part and maturity stage in analyzing volatile components, providing valuable insights for future research in plant chemistry.

Data Processing Conditions Preliminary analysis: Use the VOCal analysis software that comes with the FlavourSpec\u00ae \ufb02avor analyzer. The VOCal software can be used to analyze the spectra output from the instrument and perform qualitative and quantitative data analysis. The built-in IMS and NIST databases can be used to compare and qualitatively identify volatile substances. After establishing a standard curve for the identi\ufb01ed substances, quantitative analysis can be per- formed. The database is equipped with three plug-ins: Reporter, Gallery Plot, and Dynamic PCA. The Reporter plug-in can directly compare spectral differences in two-dimensional, three-dimensional and other aspects; the Gallery Plot plug-in can compare the output \ufb01ngerprint spectra and quantitatively and intuitively compare the differences in volatile substances between different samples; the Dynamic PCA plug-in can perform dynamic prin- cipal component analysis and similarity analysis to quickly identify unknown samples [22]. Quantitative calculation of chemical components: Ci = Cis \u00d7 Ai Ais Ci is the calculated mass concentration of the chemical component, in \u00b5g/L; Cis is the mass concentration of the internal standard substance. The internal standard substance used in the experiment is 4-methyl-2-pentanol, with a concentration of 198 \u00b5g/L; Ai is the signal peak volume of the chemical component; Ais is the signal peak volume of the internal standard substance. 3.2.4. OAV Value Analysis The OAV analysis method will be used to analyze and screen the main aroma compo- nents. The calculation of the OAV value is related to the threshold value of the main aroma component itself. The selection of the threshold value mainly refers to the book \u201cODOUR THRESHOLDS\u201d. Due to different years and different statistical methods, there may be differences in the same substance. The principle for selecting the threshold value in this experiment is: the air threshold value is selected for Schisandra dried fruit, and the water threshold value is selected for Schisandra branch exudate. All threshold values are selected from the latest data (odor thresholds: compilations of odor threshold values in air, water and other media). Calculation of OAV value: OAV = C OT C\u2014the amount of substance, in units of mg/m3 (in air), mg/kg (in water); OT\u2014the threshold value of the substance itself. 14 of 16 (1) (2) Molecules 2023, 28, 6865 3.2.5. OPLS-DA Analysis OPLS-DA analysis, also known as orthogonal partial least squares discriminant anal- ysis, is used to observe the clustering of samples based on principal component analysis (PCA) data analysis. The OPLS-DA analysis model is then used to screen VIP values, identify differential variables, and locate key differential volatile substances. This part was used by SIMCA and SPSS. 4.

Quantitative calculation of chemical components: Ci = Cis \u00d7 Ai Ais Ci is the calculated mass concentration of the chemical component, in \u00b5g/L; Cis is the mass concentration of the internal standard substance. The internal standard substance used in the experiment is 4-methyl-2-pentanol, with a concentration of 198 \u00b5g/L; Ai is the signal peak volume of the chemical component; Ais is the signal peak volume of the internal standard substance. 3.2.4. OAV Value Analysis The OAV analysis method will be used to analyze and screen the main aroma compo- nents. The calculation of the OAV value is related to the threshold value of the main aroma component itself. The selection of the threshold value mainly refers to the book \u201cODOUR THRESHOLDS\u201d. Due to different years and different statistical methods, there may be differences in the same substance. The principle for selecting the threshold value in this experiment is: the air threshold value is selected for Schisandra dried fruit, and the water threshold value is selected for Schisandra branch exudate. All threshold values are selected from the latest data (odor thresholds: compilations of odor threshold values in air, water and other media). Calculation of OAV value: OAV = C OT C\u2014the amount of substance, in units of mg/m3 (in air), mg/kg (in water); OT\u2014the threshold value of the substance itself. 14 of 16 (1) (2) Molecules 2023, 28, 6865 3.2.5. OPLS-DA Analysis OPLS-DA analysis, also known as orthogonal partial least squares discriminant anal- ysis, is used to observe the clustering of samples based on principal component analysis (PCA) data analysis. The OPLS-DA analysis model is then used to screen VIP values, identify differential variables, and locate key differential volatile substances. This part was used by SIMCA and SPSS. 4. Conclusions This study applied GC-IMS technology for the \ufb01rst time to analyze volatile chemical substances in Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit of different colors. The volatile substance \ufb01ngerprint of white-, yellow-, and red-fruit Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit was established. This \ufb01ngerprint can effectively distinguish Schisandra chinensis dried fruit and branch exudates of different colors and can be directly used for quality characteristic evaluation and germplasm identi\ufb01cation. Different algorithms, such as PCA-X, one-way ANOVA, OPLS-DA, and OAV were used to compare and analyze the volatile components of Schisandra chinensis. The results showed significant differences in content among the aroma components of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit. The content and number of high-content types of aroma components in Schisandra chinensis dried fruit are higher than those in branch exudate sam- ples. Comparing between different fruit colors, it was found that the aroma composition of white fruit and yellow fruit Schisandra chinensis is closer, with red fruit Schisandra chinensis signi\ufb01cantly different from yellow fruit and white fruit. The experiment screened out key volatile chemical substances of dried fruits and branch exudates through VIP value and p value joint screening. The key volatile substances of overripe fruits are more abundant than those of branch exudates, with complex composi- tion and signi\ufb01cant differences. These \ufb01ndings highlight the importance of considering both plant part and maturity stage in analyzing volatile components, providing valuable insights for future research in plant chemistry.
