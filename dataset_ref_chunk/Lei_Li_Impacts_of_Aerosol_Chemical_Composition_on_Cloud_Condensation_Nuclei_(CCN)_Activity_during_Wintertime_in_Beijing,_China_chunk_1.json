During the observation period, the mean CCN number concentrations ranged from 1345 \u00b1 1270 cm\u22123 at SS = 0.1% to 3267 \u00b1 2325 cm\u22123 at SS = 0.3%. The mean critical activation diameters (D50) at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were 172 \u00b1 13 nm, 102 \u00b1 8 nm, and 84 \u00b1 7 nm, corresponding to the average hygroscopicity parameters (\u03baCCN) of 0.34, 0.33, and 0.26, respectively. The diurnal variations in D50 suggested that the local primary emissions signi\ufb01cantly enhanced D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had less in\ufb02uence on D50 at SS = 0.1% due to the limited size (<150 nm) of particles emitted from primary sources. As PM2.5 concentration increases, the dominant driver of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. At a speci\ufb01c SS, D50 decreased with increases in the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal mixing degree during atmospheric aging was bene\ufb01cial to CCN activation. In this study, the commonly used f 44 (or O:C) was weakly correlated with \u03baorg and failed to describe the variations in \u03baorg. Instead, the variations in \u03baorg can be well parameterized with the Org/BC ratio.

The diurnal variations in D50 suggested that the local primary emissions signi\ufb01cantly enhanced D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had less in\ufb02uence on D50 at SS = 0.1% due to the limited size (<150 nm) of particles emitted from primary sources.

During the observation period, the mean CCN number concentrations ranged from 1345 \u00b1 1270 cm\u22123 at SS = 0.1% to 3267 \u00b1 2325 cm\u22123 at SS = 0.3%. The mean critical activation diameters (D50) at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were 172 \u00b1 13 nm, 102 \u00b1 8 nm, and 84 \u00b1 7 nm, corresponding to the average hygroscopicity parameters (\u03baCCN) of 0.34, 0.33, and 0.26, respectively. The diurnal variations in D50 suggested that the local primary emissions signi\ufb01cantly enhanced D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had less in\ufb02uence on D50 at SS = 0.1% due to the limited size (<150 nm) of particles emitted from primary sources. As PM2.5 concentration increases, the dominant driver of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. At a speci\ufb01c SS, D50 decreased with increases in the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal mixing degree during atmospheric aging was bene\ufb01cial to CCN activation. In this study, the commonly used f 44 (or O:C) was weakly correlated with \u03baorg and failed to describe the variations in \u03baorg. Instead, the variations in \u03baorg can be well parameterized with the Org/BC ratio. The correlation between \u03ba derived from bulk chemical compositions and CCN measurements was substantially improved when this \u03baorg scheme was adopted, emphasizing the importance of considering \u03baorg variations on deriving \u03bachem from aerosol chemical composition.
