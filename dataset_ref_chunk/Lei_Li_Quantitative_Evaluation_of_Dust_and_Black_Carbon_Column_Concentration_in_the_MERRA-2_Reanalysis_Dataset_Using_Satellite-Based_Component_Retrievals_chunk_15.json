Conclusions The aerosol assimilation system in MERRA-2 reanalysis data has been assessed and validated by many studies using the measurements of aerosol optical properties such as AOD over a regional or global scale. However, the evaluation of MERRA-2 aerosol component products is still not conducted globally due to the scarcity of aerosol component measurements on extensive temporal and spatial scales. This study presents a quantita- tive evaluation of the MERRA-2 reanalysis dust and BC column concentration using the independent satellite-measured aerosol component concentration retrievals, which are not assimilated by the MERRA-2 reanalysis system. Several dust emission resource regions and the critical downwind dust-dominated regions are selected for the comparisons of mineral dust column concentration globally, as well as the conducted BC comparisons in some key regions of interest for strong BC emission. Generally, the performed analysis conducted in the key regions of interest globally highlights the agreement between MERRA-2 and GRASP/Component for the mineral dust and black carbon column concentration products, although some differences can be observed with reasonable explanations. It is critical to understand the behavior of MERRA-2 reanalysis component estimation and component retrievals derived from satellite observations. The GRASP/Component and MERRA-2 reanalysis products show consistent temporal variation in dust column concentration over the dust emission resource regions, with the correlation coef\ufb01cient varying from 0.91 to 0.80. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 40~70% over the African dust emission resource regions (SAH and BOD). However, over Asian dust emission resource regions (MIE, TAK, and GOB), the relative differences are mostly less than 40%, even for negative values in the TAK region. Over the downwind dust-dominated regions, the similar temporal variations in dust column concentration are also re\ufb02ected by both GRASP/Component dust retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products, with the correlation coef\ufb01cient varying from 0.98 to 0.84. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 20~50% over the downwind dust-dominated regions except for the BOB region. Most of the relative differ- ences in the BOB region are negative and can even reach a value smaller than \u2212150%. Over the biomass burning and BC-affected areas in the globe, similar temporal varia- tions in BC column concentration are represented by both GRASP/Component BC retrievals and MERRA-2 BC products with a correlation coef\ufb01cient of about 0.70~0.90 except the NCP region. Higher column concentrations with relative differences of about 80% and lower column concentrations with relative differences of about \u221220% are presented by MERRA-2 reanalysis BC products compared to GRASP/Component BC retrievals We should point out that the statistics for the comparisons of monthly regional aver- aged concentration could indicate that both MERRA-2 products and GRASP/Component retrievals can capture well the temporal variations in dust and BC column concentration with a high correlation coef\ufb01cient. Large differences and high correlation coef\ufb01cients could be obtained when systematic biases exist. For instance, a high correlation coef\ufb01- cient and large RMSE are obtained for dust comparisons in SAH, BOD, and MIE. In this case, we should pay more caution with the regional applicability of MERRA-2 component products. Although the magnitudes of dust and BC column concentration described by GRASP/Component retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset present non-negligible dis- crepancies in some key regions, the results are helpful for the understanding of MERRA-2 reanalysis component products in a new view and demonstrate a practical application of the satellite-based component retrievals. With the development of an inversion algorithm and independent measurement data, the reasons for these differences are expected to be addressed in the near future. 19 of 22 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 388 Author Contributions: Conceptualization, L.L. and H.C.; methodology, L.L.; Software, L.L. and X.S.; validation, L.L., H.C. and X.Z.

Several dust emission resource regions and the critical downwind dust-dominated regions are selected for the comparisons of mineral dust column concentration globally, as well as the conducted BC comparisons in some key regions of interest for strong BC emission. Generally, the performed analysis conducted in the key regions of interest globally highlights the agreement between MERRA-2 and GRASP/Component for the mineral dust and black carbon column concentration products, although some differences can be observed with reasonable explanations. It is critical to understand the behavior of MERRA-2 reanalysis component estimation and component retrievals derived from satellite observations. The GRASP/Component and MERRA-2 reanalysis products show consistent temporal variation in dust column concentration over the dust emission resource regions, with the correlation coef\ufb01cient varying from 0.91 to 0.80. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 40~70% over the African dust emission resource regions (SAH and BOD). However, over Asian dust emission resource regions (MIE, TAK, and GOB), the relative differences are mostly less than 40%, even for negative values in the TAK region. Over the downwind dust-dominated regions, the similar temporal variations in dust column concentration are also re\ufb02ected by both GRASP/Component dust retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products, with the correlation coef\ufb01cient varying from 0.98 to 0.84. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 20~50% over the downwind dust-dominated regions except for the BOB region. Most of the relative differ- ences in the BOB region are negative and can even reach a value smaller than \u2212150%. Over the biomass burning and BC-affected areas in the globe, similar temporal varia- tions in BC column concentration are represented by both GRASP/Component BC retrievals and MERRA-2 BC products with a correlation coef\ufb01cient of about 0.70~0.90 except the NCP region. Higher column concentrations with relative differences of about 80% and lower column concentrations with relative differences of about \u221220% are presented by MERRA-2 reanalysis BC products compared to GRASP/Component BC retrievals We should point out that the statistics for the comparisons of monthly regional aver- aged concentration could indicate that both MERRA-2 products and GRASP/Component retrievals can capture well the temporal variations in dust and BC column concentration with a high correlation coef\ufb01cient. Large differences and high correlation coef\ufb01cients could be obtained when systematic biases exist. For instance, a high correlation coef\ufb01- cient and large RMSE are obtained for dust comparisons in SAH, BOD, and MIE. In this case, we should pay more caution with the regional applicability of MERRA-2 component products. Although the magnitudes of dust and BC column concentration described by GRASP/Component retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset present non-negligible dis- crepancies in some key regions, the results are helpful for the understanding of MERRA-2 reanalysis component products in a new view and demonstrate a practical application of the satellite-based component retrievals. With the development of an inversion algorithm and independent measurement data, the reasons for these differences are expected to be addressed in the near future. 19 of 22 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 388 Author Contributions: Conceptualization, L.L. and H.C.; methodology, L.L.; Software, L.L. and X.S.; validation, L.L., H.C. and X.Z.

Over the downwind dust-dominated regions, the similar temporal variations in dust column concentration are also re\ufb02ected by both GRASP/Component dust retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products, with the correlation coef\ufb01cient varying from 0.98 to 0.84. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 20~50% over the downwind dust-dominated regions except for the BOB region. Most of the relative differ- ences in the BOB region are negative and can even reach a value smaller than \u2212150%. Over the biomass burning and BC-affected areas in the globe, similar temporal varia- tions in BC column concentration are represented by both GRASP/Component BC retrievals and MERRA-2 BC products with a correlation coef\ufb01cient of about 0.70~0.90 except the NCP region. Higher column concentrations with relative differences of about 80% and lower column concentrations with relative differences of about \u221220% are presented by MERRA-2 reanalysis BC products compared to GRASP/Component BC retrievals We should point out that the statistics for the comparisons of monthly regional aver- aged concentration could indicate that both MERRA-2 products and GRASP/Component retrievals can capture well the temporal variations in dust and BC column concentration with a high correlation coef\ufb01cient. Large differences and high correlation coef\ufb01cients could be obtained when systematic biases exist. For instance, a high correlation coef\ufb01- cient and large RMSE are obtained for dust comparisons in SAH, BOD, and MIE. In this case, we should pay more caution with the regional applicability of MERRA-2 component products. Although the magnitudes of dust and BC column concentration described by GRASP/Component retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset present non-negligible dis- crepancies in some key regions, the results are helpful for the understanding of MERRA-2 reanalysis component products in a new view and demonstrate a practical application of the satellite-based component retrievals. With the development of an inversion algorithm and independent measurement data, the reasons for these differences are expected to be addressed in the near future. 19 of 22 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 388 Author Contributions: Conceptualization, L.L. and H.C.; methodology, L.L.; Software, L.L. and X.S.; validation, L.L., H.C. and X.Z.

Conclusions The aerosol assimilation system in MERRA-2 reanalysis data has been assessed and validated by many studies using the measurements of aerosol optical properties such as AOD over a regional or global scale. However, the evaluation of MERRA-2 aerosol component products is still not conducted globally due to the scarcity of aerosol component measurements on extensive temporal and spatial scales. This study presents a quantita- tive evaluation of the MERRA-2 reanalysis dust and BC column concentration using the independent satellite-measured aerosol component concentration retrievals, which are not assimilated by the MERRA-2 reanalysis system. Several dust emission resource regions and the critical downwind dust-dominated regions are selected for the comparisons of mineral dust column concentration globally, as well as the conducted BC comparisons in some key regions of interest for strong BC emission. Generally, the performed analysis conducted in the key regions of interest globally highlights the agreement between MERRA-2 and GRASP/Component for the mineral dust and black carbon column concentration products, although some differences can be observed with reasonable explanations. It is critical to understand the behavior of MERRA-2 reanalysis component estimation and component retrievals derived from satellite observations. The GRASP/Component and MERRA-2 reanalysis products show consistent temporal variation in dust column concentration over the dust emission resource regions, with the correlation coef\ufb01cient varying from 0.91 to 0.80. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 40~70% over the African dust emission resource regions (SAH and BOD).
