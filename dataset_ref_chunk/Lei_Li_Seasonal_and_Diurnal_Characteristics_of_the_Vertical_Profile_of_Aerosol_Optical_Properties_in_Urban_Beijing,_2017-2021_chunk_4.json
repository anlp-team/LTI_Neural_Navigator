Where N denotes the total number of aerosol extinction pro\ufb01les for each month. Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 475 The extinction coef\ufb01cient is largest in summer, followed by winter, and is roughly the same in both spring and autumn, with mean values of the extinction coef\ufb01cient at 300 m being about 0.4, 0.35 and 0.3 km\u22121. The aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient within 2 km of ground level is highest in summer, especially in July, and the extinction coef\ufb01cient at 300 m is 0.5 km\u22121. This suggests that aerosol particles are more likely to absorb moisture and grow under the high temperature and high humidity conditions in summer, increasing the extinction coef\ufb01cient [68\u201370]. It also suggests that there is a broader distribution of aerosol particles in summer. This may be because the maximum height of the boundary layer in summer can develop to about 2 km and aerosol particles are transported to this altitude via turbulence [71,72]. The extinction coef\ufb01cient within 0.5 km of the ground is also relatively large in February, October, November and December, with an average value of about 0.4 km\u22121. This is because buildings in Beijing are heated during autumn and winter, leading to higher emissions of pollutants, more frequent pollution events and higher aerosol mass concentrations, resulting in an increase in the extinction coef\ufb01cient within 0.5 km of the ground surface [25]. In the range 1\u20132 km above ground level, the extinction coef\ufb01cient is highest in summer, followed by spring and autumn, and smallest in winter. The extinction coef\ufb01cient in the range 1\u20132 km varies between 0.1 and 0.2 km\u22121 in winter because the mean value of the boundary layer height is <1 km in this season [72,73] and aerosol particles are not easily transported to >1 km, resulting in a smaller extinction coef\ufb01cient for aerosols above 1 km. Aerosols are transported to high altitudes during the frequent dust events in Beijing in spring [74\u201376] and the extinction coef\ufb01cient is therefore largest at 2\u20133 km in spring. The mean value of the extinction coef\ufb01cient is about 0.1 km\u22121 and it is almost unchanged with increasing height. Figure 3 shows the daily variation of the atmospheric extinction coef\ufb01cient in urban Beijing from autumn 2017 to winter 2020. In spring, turbulent motion transports aerosol particles to 0.5\u20131 km during the development of the boundary layer from 07:00 and the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient gradually increases in this height range until reaching a maximum value around noon. The aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient within about 0.75 km is >0.3 km\u22121. The height of the boundary layer decreases from 12:00 to 23:00 and from 00:00 to 06:00 and the aerosol particles are gradually pressed downward to below 0.5 km. The extinction coef\ufb01cient of aerosols at 2\u20133 km altitude in spring is higher from 02:00 to 14:00 than in other seasons as a result of the frequent occurrence of sand and dust pollution in Beijing [74\u201376]. In summer, the boundary layer develops at 07:00 and turbulent motion brings aerosols from below 0.5 km to between 0.5 and 1.5 km. The extinction coef\ufb01cient between 0.5 and 1.5 km gradually increases until it reaches a maximum at 13:00. The extinction coef\ufb01cients are all >0.3 km\u22121 within about 1.25 km of the ground surface. Between 13:00 and 18:00, as the sun sets, the aerosols in the range 0.5\u20131.5 km above the ground surface are gradually depressed to below 0.7 km, the extinction coef\ufb01cient within the range 0.5\u20131.5 km decreases, and the lowest extinction coef\ufb01cient gradually increases to 0.45 km\u22121. However, in the range 1\u20131.5 km, the extinction coef\ufb01cient always remains between 0.15 and 0.3 km\u22121 because some aerosols are retained in the residual layer, resulting in a relatively high extinction coef\ufb01cient between 1 and 1.5 km [77,78]. 6 of 22 Figure 3.

In summer, the boundary layer develops at 07:00 and turbulent motion brings aerosols from below 0.5 km to between 0.5 and 1.5 km. The extinction coefficient between 0.5 and 1.5 km gradually increases until it reaches a maximum at 13:00. The extinction coefficients are all >0.3 km(cid:2879)(cid:2869) within about 1.25 km of the ground surface.

The daily variation in the vertical distribution of aerosols in autumn is similar to that in spring. In winter, with the development of the boundary layer from 08:00 to 14:00, the aerosol extinction coefficient between 0.5 and 1 km gradually increases and the aerosol extinction coefficient below about 0.6 km is >0.3 km(cid:2879)(cid:2869).

From 12:00 to 18:00, the aerosol extinction coefficient in the range 0.5\u20132 km is significantly lower in winter than in other seasons. By contrast, the aerosol extinction coefficient below 0.5 km is higher than in other seasons. This is because the boundary layer height is relatively low in winter and pollutants are not easily transported to altitudes >0.5 km [72].

Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 475 The extinction coef\ufb01cient is largest in summer, followed by winter, and is roughly the same in both spring and autumn, with mean values of the extinction coef\ufb01cient at 300 m being about 0.4, 0.35 and 0.3 km\u22121. The aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient within 2 km of ground level is highest in summer, especially in July, and the extinction coef\ufb01cient at 300 m is 0.5 km\u22121. This suggests that aerosol particles are more likely to absorb moisture and grow under the high temperature and high humidity conditions in summer, increasing the extinction coef\ufb01cient [68\u201370]. It also suggests that there is a broader distribution of aerosol particles in summer. This may be because the maximum height of the boundary layer in summer can develop to about 2 km and aerosol particles are transported to this altitude via turbulence [71,72]. The extinction coef\ufb01cient within 0.5 km of the ground is also relatively large in February, October, November and December, with an average value of about 0.4 km\u22121. This is because buildings in Beijing are heated during autumn and winter, leading to higher emissions of pollutants, more frequent pollution events and higher aerosol mass concentrations, resulting in an increase in the extinction coef\ufb01cient within 0.5 km of the ground surface [25]. In the range 1\u20132 km above ground level, the extinction coef\ufb01cient is highest in summer, followed by spring and autumn, and smallest in winter. The extinction coef\ufb01cient in the range 1\u20132 km varies between 0.1 and 0.2 km\u22121 in winter because the mean value of the boundary layer height is <1 km in this season [72,73] and aerosol particles are not easily transported to >1 km, resulting in a smaller extinction coef\ufb01cient for aerosols above 1 km. Aerosols are transported to high altitudes during the frequent dust events in Beijing in spring [74\u201376] and the extinction coef\ufb01cient is therefore largest at 2\u20133 km in spring. The mean value of the extinction coef\ufb01cient is about 0.1 km\u22121 and it is almost unchanged with increasing height. Figure 3 shows the daily variation of the atmospheric extinction coef\ufb01cient in urban Beijing from autumn 2017 to winter 2020. In spring, turbulent motion transports aerosol particles to 0.5\u20131 km during the development of the boundary layer from 07:00 and the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient gradually increases in this height range until reaching a maximum value around noon. The aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient within about 0.75 km is >0.3 km\u22121. The height of the boundary layer decreases from 12:00 to 23:00 and from 00:00 to 06:00 and the aerosol particles are gradually pressed downward to below 0.5 km. The extinction coef\ufb01cient of aerosols at 2\u20133 km altitude in spring is higher from 02:00 to 14:00 than in other seasons as a result of the frequent occurrence of sand and dust pollution in Beijing [74\u201376]. In summer, the boundary layer develops at 07:00 and turbulent motion brings aerosols from below 0.5 km to between 0.5 and 1.5 km. The extinction coef\ufb01cient between 0.5 and 1.5 km gradually increases until it reaches a maximum at 13:00. The extinction coef\ufb01cients are all >0.3 km\u22121 within about 1.25 km of the ground surface. Between 13:00 and 18:00, as the sun sets, the aerosols in the range 0.5\u20131.5 km above the ground surface are gradually depressed to below 0.7 km, the extinction coef\ufb01cient within the range 0.5\u20131.5 km decreases, and the lowest extinction coef\ufb01cient gradually increases to 0.45 km\u22121. However, in the range 1\u20131.5 km, the extinction coef\ufb01cient always remains between 0.15 and 0.3 km\u22121 because some aerosols are retained in the residual layer, resulting in a relatively high extinction coef\ufb01cient between 1 and 1.5 km [77,78]. 6 of 22 Figure 3.

The daily variation in the vertical distribution of aerosols in autumn is similar to that in spring. In winter, with the development of the boundary layer from 08:00 to 14:00, the aerosol extinction coefficient between 0.5 and 1 km gradually increases and the aerosol extinction coefficient below about 0.6 km is >0.3 km(cid:2879)(cid:2869).

From 12:00 to 18:00, the aerosol extinction coefficient in the range 0.5\u20132 km is significantly lower in winter than in other seasons. By contrast, the aerosol extinction coefficient below 0.5 km is higher than in other seasons. This is because the boundary layer height is relatively low in winter and pollutants are not easily transported to altitudes >0.5 km [72].

Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 475 The extinction coef\ufb01cient is largest in summer, followed by winter, and is roughly the same in both spring and autumn, with mean values of the extinction coef\ufb01cient at 300 m being about 0.4, 0.35 and 0.3 km\u22121. The aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient within 2 km of ground level is highest in summer, especially in July, and the extinction coef\ufb01cient at 300 m is 0.5 km\u22121. This suggests that aerosol particles are more likely to absorb moisture and grow under the high temperature and high humidity conditions in summer, increasing the extinction coef\ufb01cient [68\u201370]. It also suggests that there is a broader distribution of aerosol particles in summer. This may be because the maximum height of the boundary layer in summer can develop to about 2 km and aerosol particles are transported to this altitude via turbulence [71,72]. The extinction coef\ufb01cient within 0.5 km of the ground is also relatively large in February, October, November and December, with an average value of about 0.4 km\u22121. This is because buildings in Beijing are heated during autumn and winter, leading to higher emissions of pollutants, more frequent pollution events and higher aerosol mass concentrations, resulting in an increase in the extinction coef\ufb01cient within 0.5 km of the ground surface [25]. In the range 1\u20132 km above ground level, the extinction coef\ufb01cient is highest in summer, followed by spring and autumn, and smallest in winter. The extinction coef\ufb01cient in the range 1\u20132 km varies between 0.1 and 0.2 km\u22121 in winter because the mean value of the boundary layer height is <1 km in this season [72,73] and aerosol particles are not easily transported to >1 km, resulting in a smaller extinction coef\ufb01cient for aerosols above 1 km. Aerosols are transported to high altitudes during the frequent dust events in Beijing in spring [74\u201376] and the extinction coef\ufb01cient is therefore largest at 2\u20133 km in spring. The mean value of the extinction coef\ufb01cient is about 0.1 km\u22121 and it is almost unchanged with increasing height. Figure 3 shows the daily variation of the atmospheric extinction coef\ufb01cient in urban Beijing from autumn 2017 to winter 2020. In spring, turbulent motion transports aerosol particles to 0.5\u20131 km during the development of the boundary layer from 07:00 and the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient gradually increases in this height range until reaching a maximum value around noon. The aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient within about 0.75 km is >0.3 km\u22121. The height of the boundary layer decreases from 12:00 to 23:00 and from 00:00 to 06:00 and the aerosol particles are gradually pressed downward to below 0.5 km. The extinction coef\ufb01cient of aerosols at 2\u20133 km altitude in spring is higher from 02:00 to 14:00 than in other seasons as a result of the frequent occurrence of sand and dust pollution in Beijing [74\u201376]. In summer, the boundary layer develops at 07:00 and turbulent motion brings aerosols from below 0.5 km to between 0.5 and 1.5 km. The extinction coef\ufb01cient between 0.5 and 1.5 km gradually increases until it reaches a maximum at 13:00. The extinction coef\ufb01cients are all >0.3 km\u22121 within about 1.25 km of the ground surface. Between 13:00 and 18:00, as the sun sets, the aerosols in the range 0.5\u20131.5 km above the ground surface are gradually depressed to below 0.7 km, the extinction coef\ufb01cient within the range 0.5\u20131.5 km decreases, and the lowest extinction coef\ufb01cient gradually increases to 0.45 km\u22121. However, in the range 1\u20131.5 km, the extinction coef\ufb01cient always remains between 0.15 and 0.3 km\u22121 because some aerosols are retained in the residual layer, resulting in a relatively high extinction coef\ufb01cient between 1 and 1.5 km [77,78]. 6 of 22 Figure 3. Hourly variations in the vertical profile of the aerosol extinction coefficient in urban Beijing from September 2017 to February 2021. In summer, the boundary layer develops at 07:00 and turbulent motion brings aerosols from below 0.5 km to between 0.5 and 1.5 km. The extinction coefficient between 0.5 and 1.5 km gradually increases until it reaches a maximum at 13:00. The extinction coefficients are all >0.3 km(cid:2879)(cid:2869) within about 1.25 km of the ground surface. Between 13:00 and 18:00, as the sun sets, the aerosols in the range 0.5\u20131.5 km above the ground surface are gradually depressed to below 0.7 km, the extinction coefficient within the range 0.5\u20131.5 km decreases, and the lowest extinction coefficient gradually increases to 0.45 km(cid:2879)(cid:2869). However, in the range 1\u20131.5 km, the extinction coefficient always remains between 0.15 and 0.3 km(cid:2879)(cid:2869) because some aerosols are retained in the residual layer, resulting in a relatively high extinction coefficient between 1 and 1.5 km [77,78]. The daily variation in the vertical distribution of aerosols in autumn is similar to that in spring. In winter, with the development of the boundary layer from 08:00 to 14:00, the aerosol extinction coefficient between 0.5 and 1 km gradually increases and the aerosol extinction coefficient below about 0.6 km is >0.3 km(cid:2879)(cid:2869). The boundary layer height decreases after 14:00 and the aerosol particles are gradually pressed down to below 0.5 km. From 12:00 to 18:00, the aerosol extinction coefficient in the range 0.5\u20132 km is significantly lower in winter than in other seasons. By contrast, the aerosol extinction coefficient below 0.5 km is higher than in other seasons. This is because the boundary layer height is relatively low in winter and pollutants are not easily transported to altitudes >0.5 km [72]. In addition, winter is the main heating season in Beijing and the emission of pollutants increases the aerosol extinction coefficient below 0.5 km [25].
