GC-IMS Conditions The FlavourSpec\u00ae \ufb02avor analyzer (GAS Company, Jinan China) was used in the ex-periment. The operating conditions of the detector were as follows: input voltage: 220 V, frequency 50 Hz, ambient temperature 22 \u00b0C, humidity 42%, and the gas used was high-purity nitrogen (99.999%). The detector\u2019s ionization source was a tritium source (H3), with the type of radiation being beta radiation. The radiation energy of the ionization source was 6.5 KeV. The length of the drift tube was 98 mm, and the voltage of the drift tube was 5000 V. Gas phase\u2013ion mobility spectrometry unit: analysis time 25 min; column type: MXT-5, length 15 m, inner diameter 0.53 mm, \ufb01lm thickness 1 \u00b5m; column temperature 60 \u00b0C; carrier gas/drift gas: N2; IMS temperature: 45 \u00b0C.

The initial carrier gas \ufb02ow rate is set to 2 mL/min for 0\u20132 min, and the carrier gas \ufb02ow rate is increased to 100 mL/min for 2\u201320 min. The carrier gas \ufb02ow rate is maintained at 100 mL/min for 20\u201325 min until the end. 3.2.3.

The built-in IMS and NIST databases can be used to compare and qualitatively identify volatile substances. After establishing a standard curve for the identi\ufb01ed substances, quantitative analysis can be performed. The database is equipped with three plug-ins: Reporter, Gallery Plot, and Dynamic PCA. The Reporter plug-in can directly compare spectral di\ufb00erences in two-di-mensional, three-dimensional and other aspects; the Gallery Plot plug-in can compare the output \ufb01ngerprint spectra and quantitatively and intuitively compare the di\ufb00erences in volatile substances between di\ufb00erent samples; the Dynamic PCA plug-in can perform Through the screening of OAV values, the key \ufb02avor substance in white fruit dried fruit is (E)-2-hexenal.

Both Schisandra chinensis dried fruit and branch exudates show that 3-Methyl-butanal is the key \ufb02avor substance of Schisandra chinensis. This substance is the main aroma component of green tea that has been killed and has elegant peach, choco- late, and fat aromas [19]. It can be used as a characteristic volatile label substance for Schisandra chinensis identi\ufb01cation. 1,8-cineole in dried fruit is also a major contributing aroma substance with a cool mint and camphor smell. It is the main aroma component of Australian grape wine and is also used as a food additive and spice [20]. At the same time, chemical substances such as \u03b2-ocimene and myrcene with high OAV values have also been found in traditional Chinese medicines such as qianhu and have obvious aromatic odors (Surendran et al. 2021; Jovanovi\u00b4c et al. 2015 [21]). There are a total of 24 volatile chemical substances with OAV > 1 in Schisandra chinensis dried fruit and branch exudates. The aroma substances are rich and have high potential for tea, seasoning, and spice development. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1.

White fruit germplasm (3N2S2), yellow fruit germplasm (variety \u201cJinwuwei No. 1\u201d) and red fruit germplasm (variety \u201cYanzhihong\u201d) were all collected from the Schisandra National Forest Germplasm Resource Bank of the Institute of Special Products of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Figure 12). Three clonal plants were selected for each resource. The three different-colored Schisandra fruits were harvested when they were fully ripe in September 2019. After removing the stems and branches in the laboratory, they were dried in the shade at 22 \u25e6C. They were completely dried after one month and then vacuum-sealed and stored in a refrigerator at 4 \u25e6C, respectively. In March of the following spring, branch exudates from the above germplasms were collected, placed in 50 mL centrifuge tubes, and labeled as white juice, yellow juice, and red juice. Three parallel samples were set up for each sample. W1, W2, and W3 are branch exudates of white-fruit, yellow-fruit, and red-fruit Schisandra, respectively.

The carrier gas \ufb02ow rate is maintained at 100 mL/min for 20\u201325 min until the end. 3.2.3. Data Processing Conditions Preliminary analysis: Use the VOCal analysis software that comes with the Flavour-Spec\u00ae \ufb02avor analyzer. The VOCal software can be used to analyze the spectra output from the instrument and perform qualitative and quantitative data analysis. The built-in IMS and NIST databases can be used to compare and qualitatively identify volatile substances. After establishing a standard curve for the identi\ufb01ed substances, quantitative analysis can be performed. The database is equipped with three plug-ins: Reporter, Gallery Plot, and Dynamic PCA. The Reporter plug-in can directly compare spectral di\ufb00erences in two-di-mensional, three-dimensional and other aspects; the Gallery Plot plug-in can compare the output \ufb01ngerprint spectra and quantitatively and intuitively compare the di\ufb00erences in volatile substances between di\ufb00erent samples; the Dynamic PCA plug-in can perform Through the screening of OAV values, the key \ufb02avor substance in white fruit dried fruit is (E)-2-hexenal. This substance is also the main aroma-contributing substance of Chinese jujubes, with a strong plant aroma (fresh green, multi-leaf, rich fruit \ufb02avor) \ufb02a- vor characteristics [4] (http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/search2.html, accessed on 28 March 2023). Both Schisandra chinensis dried fruit and branch exudates show that 3-Methyl-butanal is the key \ufb02avor substance of Schisandra chinensis. This substance is the main aroma component of green tea that has been killed and has elegant peach, choco- late, and fat aromas [19]. It can be used as a characteristic volatile label substance for Schisandra chinensis identi\ufb01cation. 1,8-cineole in dried fruit is also a major contributing aroma substance with a cool mint and camphor smell. It is the main aroma component of Australian grape wine and is also used as a food additive and spice [20]. At the same time, chemical substances such as \u03b2-ocimene and myrcene with high OAV values have also been found in traditional Chinese medicines such as qianhu and have obvious aromatic odors (Surendran et al. 2021; Jovanovi\u00b4c et al. 2015 [21]). There are a total of 24 volatile chemical substances with OAV > 1 in Schisandra chinensis dried fruit and branch exudates. The aroma substances are rich and have high potential for tea, seasoning, and spice development. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1.

White fruit germplasm (3N2S2), yellow fruit germplasm (variety \u201cJinwuwei No. 1\u201d) and red fruit germplasm (variety \u201cYanzhihong\u201d) were all collected from the Schisandra National Forest Germplasm Resource Bank of the Institute of Special Products of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Figure 12). Three clonal plants were selected for each resource. The three different-colored Schisandra fruits were harvested when they were fully ripe in September 2019. After removing the stems and branches in the laboratory, they were dried in the shade at 22 \u25e6C. They were completely dried after one month and then vacuum-sealed and stored in a refrigerator at 4 \u25e6C, respectively. In March of the following spring, branch exudates from the above germplasms were collected, placed in 50 mL centrifuge tubes, and labeled as white juice, yellow juice, and red juice. Three parallel samples were set up for each sample. W1, W2, and W3 are branch exudates of white-fruit, yellow-fruit, and red-fruit Schisandra, respectively.
