Adverbs must be manner adverbs, but they should not be agent-oriented adverbs (Jackendoff 1972; Ernst 2001) that express the mental state of the agent. Examples of such adverbs include furi- ously, happily, angrily, etc. Then for each verb and a list of adverbs for each verb, we come up with a list of patient and agent nouns. All of the nouns must work in intransitive and transitive templates using the same sense of the verb. For nouns added as patients in the intransitive, the noun must not be an entity that causes the event described by the verb. Furthermore, it should not be necessarily oblique in the transitive form. In the example below, needle cannot be the direct object of the transitive and can only appear in the with prepositional phrase, so we do not include it in the list of nouns: (4) a.

For human agents, we try to add agents that are most closely associated to the action described for the event, especially with those that tend to take human direct objects in the transitive form, such as shave. C Human Annotation Details We had 19 human annotators rate all 233 unique nouns on Google Forms. Each annotator saw a different random order of the nouns and were pre- sented with 10 nouns on each page of the form, though they could go back to alter previous re- sponses. All annotators are fluent in English. An- notators were also asked to self-identify as native or non-native speakers; 14 of 19 consider themselves native speakers. For nouns that have multiple common and highly distinct word senses, we gave annotators a short dis- ambiguating description. This description does not contain any verbs or any other indicator for what types of events the entity may occur in. A list of these nouns with their disambiguating description is given in Table 5. Noun Description make plane kite jet line passage panel model routine board letter proposal turkey product of a particular company, such as of a car airplane a light frame covered with paper, cloth, or plas- tic, often with a stabilizing tail aircraft of a text/a poem/etc. of a text/an essay/etc. of wood/a hard surface/etc. person a part of an entertainment act a long, thin, flat piece of wood or other hard material a sheet of paper with words on it in an envelope a formal plan or suggestion meat Table 5: Nouns and disambiguating descriptions given to annotators. C.1 An agent is something that initiates an action, possibly with some degree of volition. In other words, nouns that tend to be agents have a tendency to do things. A patient is something that undergoes an action and often experiences a change. In other words, nouns that tend to be patients have a tendency to have things done to it. In this form, you are tasked to annotate how \"agentive\" you think a noun typically is\u2014in other words, how likely it is to be an agent or a patient when an action involving both an agent and a patient occur. Ex: The plant was watered by John. The plant = patient John = agent Ex: The sun burns John. The sun = agent John = patient A more formal definition is given by Dowty (1991), who outlines contributing properties of agents and patients: (1) Contributing properties for the Agent Proto- Role: volitional involvement in the event or state \u2014 sentience (and/or perception) causing an event or change of state in another participant movement (relative to the position of an- other participant) (exists independently of the event named by the verb) (2) Contributing properties for the Patient Proto- Role: undergoes change of state incremental theme (something that changes incrementally over the course of an event) causally affected by another participant stationary relative to movement of an- other participant stationary relative to movement of an- other participant (does not exist independently of the event, or not at all) For the sake of simplicity, disregard events de- scribed by reflexives (such as John shaved himself). For each of the following nouns, rate it on the following scale: 1 = very unlikely to be an agent 2 = somewhat unlikely to be an agent 3 = no preference between agent and patient 4 = somewhat likely to be an agent 5 = very likely to be an agent Figure 6: Example of Google Form question format given to annotators.

Adverbs must be manner adverbs, but they should not be agent-oriented adverbs (Jackendoff 1972; Ernst 2001) that express the mental state of the agent. Examples of such adverbs include furi- ously, happily, angrily, etc. Then for each verb and a list of adverbs for each verb, we come up with a list of patient and agent nouns. All of the nouns must work in intransitive and transitive templates using the same sense of the verb. For nouns added as patients in the intransitive, the noun must not be an entity that causes the event described by the verb. Furthermore, it should not be necessarily oblique in the transitive form. In the example below, needle cannot be the direct object of the transitive and can only appear in the with prepositional phrase, so we do not include it in the list of nouns: (4) a. This needle sews easily. b. The tailor sews easily with this needle. c. *The tailor sews this needle easily. For nouns added as agents, in the intransitive it must be clear that the noun is the one doing the action. For human agents, we try to add agents that are most closely associated to the action described for the event, especially with those that tend to take human direct objects in the transitive form, such as shave. C Human Annotation Details We had 19 human annotators rate all 233 unique nouns on Google Forms. Each annotator saw a different random order of the nouns and were pre- sented with 10 nouns on each page of the form, though they could go back to alter previous re- sponses. All annotators are fluent in English. An- notators were also asked to self-identify as native or non-native speakers; 14 of 19 consider themselves native speakers. For nouns that have multiple common and highly distinct word senses, we gave annotators a short dis- ambiguating description. This description does not contain any verbs or any other indicator for what types of events the entity may occur in. A list of these nouns with their disambiguating description is given in Table 5.

C.1 An agent is something that initiates an action, possibly with some degree of volition. In other words, nouns that tend to be agents have a tendency to do things. A patient is something that undergoes an action and often experiences a change. In other words, nouns that tend to be patients have a tendency to have things done to it. In this form, you are tasked to annotate how \"agentive\" you think a noun typically is\u2014in other words, how likely it is to be an agent or a patient when an action involving both an agent and a patient occur.

Noun Description make plane kite jet line passage panel model routine board letter proposal turkey product of a particular company, such as of a car airplane a light frame covered with paper, cloth, or plas- tic, often with a stabilizing tail aircraft of a text/a poem/etc. of a text/an essay/etc. of wood/a hard surface/etc. person a part of an entertainment act a long, thin, flat piece of wood or other hard material a sheet of paper with words on it in an envelope a formal plan or suggestion meat Table 5: Nouns and disambiguating descriptions given to annotators. C.1 An agent is something that initiates an action, possibly with some degree of volition. In other words, nouns that tend to be agents have a tendency to do things. A patient is something that undergoes an action and often experiences a change. In other words, nouns that tend to be patients have a tendency to have things done to it. In this form, you are tasked to annotate how \"agentive\" you think a noun typically is\u2014in other words, how likely it is to be an agent or a patient when an action involving both an agent and a patient occur. Ex: The plant was watered by John. The plant = patient John = agent Ex: The sun burns John. The sun = agent John = patient A more formal definition is given by Dowty (1991), who outlines contributing properties of agents and patients: (1) Contributing properties for the Agent Proto- Role: volitional involvement in the event or state \u2014 sentience (and/or perception) causing an event or change of state in another participant movement (relative to the position of an- other participant) (exists independently of the event named by the verb) (2) Contributing properties for the Patient Proto- Role: undergoes change of state incremental theme (something that changes incrementally over the course of an event) causally affected by another participant stationary relative to movement of an- other participant stationary relative to movement of an- other participant (does not exist independently of the event, or not at all) For the sake of simplicity, disregard events de- scribed by reflexives (such as John shaved himself). For each of the following nouns, rate it on the following scale: 1 = very unlikely to be an agent 2 = somewhat unlikely to be an agent 3 = no preference between agent and patient 4 = somewhat likely to be an agent 5 = very likely to be an agent Figure 6: Example of Google Form question format given to annotators.

The three largest"}], "doc_text": "nicely, cleanly B Data Curation Criteria After collecting a list of optionally transitive verbs that appear as intransitive via object drop (agent subject) or object promotion in the form of the mid- dle construction (patient subject), we then had to curate adverbs and nouns that work in the templates as described in Table 1. Adverbs must be manner adverbs, but they should not be agent-oriented adverbs (Jackendoff 1972; Ernst 2001) that express the mental state of the agent. Examples of such adverbs include furi- ously, happily, angrily, etc. Then for each verb and a list of adverbs for each verb, we come up with a list of patient and agent nouns. All of the nouns must work in intransitive and transitive templates using the same sense of the verb. For nouns added as patients in the intransitive, the noun must not be an entity that causes the event described by the verb. Furthermore, it should not be necessarily oblique in the transitive form. In the example below, needle cannot be the direct object of the transitive and can only appear in the with prepositional phrase, so we do not include it in the list of nouns: (4) a. This needle sews easily. b. The tailor sews easily with this needle. c. *The tailor sews this needle easily. For nouns added as agents, in the intransitive it must be clear that the noun is the one doing the action. For human agents, we try to add agents that are most closely associated to the action described for the event, especially with those that tend to take human direct objects in the transitive form, such as shave. C Human Annotation Details We had 19 human annotators rate all 233 unique nouns on Google Forms. Each annotator saw a different random order of the nouns and were pre- sented with 10 nouns on each page of the form, though they could go back to alter previous re- sponses. All annotators are fluent in English. An- notators were also asked to self-identify as native or non-native speakers; 14 of 19 consider themselves native speakers. For nouns that have multiple common and highly distinct word senses, we gave annotators a short dis- ambiguating description. This description does not contain any verbs or any other indicator for what types of events the entity may occur in. A list of these nouns with their disambiguating description is given in Table 5.
