The remaining pathways are larger (in terms of the number of genes), and it is virtually impossible for them not to have a level-2 chain. As a result, it is realistic to expect that, as a consequence of the density with which the FOXP2 containing pathway is linked to other pathways, any syndrome arising from genetic aberrations that includes even a moderately sized set of genes will have an effect on voice. It remains a plausible hypothesis that any factor that in\ufb02uences gene function has at least some chance to ultimately affect voice\u2014for example, at least a 27% chance within the boundaries of the example presented in this paper. The above argument assumes that the genes in a microdeletion region are randomly chosen. The mean of the fraction of genes in a microdeletion that appears in any voice chain is observed to be 28.79% with a variance of 0.014, indicating concordance with the assumption of randomness. A secondary implication is that the likelihood of adjacent genes in the same cytogenetic region to be chainlink genes is independent of one another. 4.4. Ancillary Observations Some important ancillary observations emerge from this study, which may be impor- tant to note. These are mentioned brie\ufb02y below. 1. 2. For each syndrome, some genes have been identi\ufb01ed as largely important\u2014i.e., these are implicated largely for the syndrome\u2019s effect on the individual. Of the syndromes for which there is information about implicated genes, we see that in only 8 syndromes (2p16.1\u2013p15, 2q23.1, 9p24.3, 11q23, 13q12.3, 17q23.1\u2013q23.2, 19p13.13, and Yq11), none of the implicated genes appear in the two levels of voice chains shown. In all other cases, the implicated genes impact FOXP2 pathways and are likely to have a bearing on speech anomalies. We have noted earlier that FOXP2 is not the only gene known to be related to voice production. If we had chosen some other gene as an example in this paper (instead of FOXP2), it is likely that the implicated genes for the 8 exceptions mentioned above would appear as chainlink genes (while some others may not). This hypothesis can be easily tested in corresponding experiments. Identifying candidate genes for further investigation: Using only chainlink genes that appear on level-1 chains as illustrative examples (see Table A1 in the Appendix A for reference), we see that voice chains can be useful in identifying candidate genes for further investigation in the context of speech issues. Some examples are given below. The likely candidates are written in parentheses, while the already implicated genes are indicated in bold: 1p36 (ARID1A): Although not implicated for this syndrome in studies so far, ARID1A is located in 1p36.11, a region frequently deleted in human cancers [69]. Disruption in its function may lead to the co-occurrence of oncological and speech issues. This hypothesis is veri\ufb01able. 5q35.3 (NSD1): The gene NSD1 appears in a level-1 chain and is also an im- plicated gene. Ideally, this should not be a candidate for further investigation. However, paradoxically, while effects on speech are expected, the literature re- ports normal speech for some subjects for this case. This may be a result of biased sampling (the more severe cases may not be conducive to life due to other concurrent severe symptoms, which is a common occurrence in microdeletion syndromes; in some cases, only mosaic individuals survive). This warrants some investigation. 11p15.5 (HRAS): Although not implicated, and although two studies cited under OMIM: 130650 for this syndrome explicitly mention HRAS as not signi\ufb01cant, HRAS has nevertheless been independently found to be extremely signi\ufb01cant in RASopathy and cancer studies, e.g., [70]. Its role in this syndrome needs to 17 of 33 Entropy 2023, 25, 897 3. be re-evaluated given its in\ufb02uence on 347 biological pathways and its strong in\ufb02uence on speech. 16p11.2 and 16p12.2\u201316p11.2 (SRCAP): Although not implicated, it connects to only one other pathway in the ensemble, and that is the ACC pathway of FOXP2. The effects on speech are expected to be strong if this gene is aberrant. This gene may be implicated in further investigations. 17p13.1 (KDM6B): Speech is absent in this syndrome. The gene TP53 is impli- cated, which also appears at level-1 and is associated with 206 pathways. KDM6B is the only other gene in the level-1 voice chains and connects to only 8 other pathways. It is likely that this gene also plays a strong role in in\ufb02uencing speech and merits investigation. 17q12 (ERBB2): The gene ERBB2 is associated with 124 pathways. It is a well- known oncogene [71], in that perturbations in its function have been observed to have deleterious effects. If it is also connected to FOXP2, then its appearance in the voice chain allows a surprising hypothesis\u2014that biomarkers of some oncological conditions may also be present in voice. 19p13.3 (MAP2K2,UHRF1): MAP2K2 and URHF1 are not implicated. However their appearance as level-1 chainlink genes warrants investigation, especially for MAP2K2, which in\ufb02uences 257 pathways. Prompted by this, a literature search did reveal that MAP2K2 has been implicated in this syndrome recently [72], although this is not on the OMIM records, which were largely consulted for this study. 22q13.3 (BRD1): The gene BRD1 is not implicated and appears in 9 pathways only, but the effect on speech is severe in this syndrome. This warrants the inves- tigation of BRD1 independently in relation to speech characteristics. A literature search reveals that BRD1 is indeed strongly associated with brain development and susceptibility to both schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder [73], and consequent effects on speech are highly likely. Xp11.22 (SMC1A): Although SMC1A is not implicated, it appears in 33 pathways. The speech issues are severe and the gene warrants investigation for this effect. A recent report in the literature has implicated it in severe intellectual disability and therapy-resistant epilepsy in females [74]. The former is known to be associated with severe speech anomalies. Xp11.3 (KDM6A): Although not implicated, KDM6A warrants investigation. In the literature, it is independently known to be associated with delayed speech and psychomotor development [75].

If it is also connected to FOXP2, then its appearance in the voice chain allows a surprising hypothesis\u2014that biomarkers of some oncological conditions may also be present in voice. 19p13.3 (MAP2K2,UHRF1): MAP2K2 and URHF1 are not implicated. However their appearance as level-1 chainlink genes warrants investigation, especially for MAP2K2, which in\ufb02uences 257 pathways. Prompted by this, a literature search did reveal that MAP2K2 has been implicated in this syndrome recently [72], although this is not on the OMIM records, which were largely consulted for this study. 22q13.3 (BRD1): The gene BRD1 is not implicated and appears in 9 pathways only, but the effect on speech is severe in this syndrome. This warrants the inves- tigation of BRD1 independently in relation to speech characteristics. A literature search reveals that BRD1 is indeed strongly associated with brain development and susceptibility to both schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder [73], and consequent effects on speech are highly likely. Xp11.22 (SMC1A): Although SMC1A is not implicated, it appears in 33 pathways. The speech issues are severe and the gene warrants investigation for this effect. A recent report in the literature has implicated it in severe intellectual disability and therapy-resistant epilepsy in females [74]. The former is known to be associated with severe speech anomalies. Xp11.3 (KDM6A): Although not implicated, KDM6A warrants investigation. In the literature, it is independently known to be associated with delayed speech and psychomotor development [75].

The remaining pathways are larger (in terms of the number of genes), and it is virtually impossible for them not to have a level-2 chain. As a result, it is realistic to expect that, as a consequence of the density with which the FOXP2 containing pathway is linked to other pathways, any syndrome arising from genetic aberrations that includes even a moderately sized set of genes will have an effect on voice. It remains a plausible hypothesis that any factor that in\ufb02uences gene function has at least some chance to ultimately affect voice\u2014for example, at least a 27% chance within the boundaries of the example presented in this paper. The above argument assumes that the genes in a microdeletion region are randomly chosen. The mean of the fraction of genes in a microdeletion that appears in any voice chain is observed to be 28.79% with a variance of 0.014, indicating concordance with the assumption of randomness. A secondary implication is that the likelihood of adjacent genes in the same cytogenetic region to be chainlink genes is independent of one another. 4.4. Ancillary Observations Some important ancillary observations emerge from this study, which may be impor- tant to note. These are mentioned brie\ufb02y below. 1. 2. For each syndrome, some genes have been identi\ufb01ed as largely important\u2014i.e., these are implicated largely for the syndrome\u2019s effect on the individual. Of the syndromes for which there is information about implicated genes, we see that in only 8 syndromes (2p16.1\u2013p15, 2q23.1, 9p24.3, 11q23, 13q12.3, 17q23.1\u2013q23.2, 19p13.13, and Yq11), none of the implicated genes appear in the two levels of voice chains shown. In all other cases, the implicated genes impact FOXP2 pathways and are likely to have a bearing on speech anomalies. We have noted earlier that FOXP2 is not the only gene known to be related to voice production. If we had chosen some other gene as an example in this paper (instead of FOXP2), it is likely that the implicated genes for the 8 exceptions mentioned above would appear as chainlink genes (while some others may not). This hypothesis can be easily tested in corresponding experiments. Identifying candidate genes for further investigation: Using only chainlink genes that appear on level-1 chains as illustrative examples (see Table A1 in the Appendix A for reference), we see that voice chains can be useful in identifying candidate genes for further investigation in the context of speech issues. Some examples are given below. The likely candidates are written in parentheses, while the already implicated genes are indicated in bold: 1p36 (ARID1A): Although not implicated for this syndrome in studies so far, ARID1A is located in 1p36.11, a region frequently deleted in human cancers [69]. Disruption in its function may lead to the co-occurrence of oncological and speech issues. This hypothesis is veri\ufb01able. 5q35.3 (NSD1): The gene NSD1 appears in a level-1 chain and is also an im- plicated gene. Ideally, this should not be a candidate for further investigation. However, paradoxically, while effects on speech are expected, the literature re- ports normal speech for some subjects for this case. This may be a result of biased sampling (the more severe cases may not be conducive to life due to other concurrent severe symptoms, which is a common occurrence in microdeletion syndromes; in some cases, only mosaic individuals survive). This warrants some investigation. 11p15.5 (HRAS): Although not implicated, and although two studies cited under OMIM: 130650 for this syndrome explicitly mention HRAS as not signi\ufb01cant, HRAS has nevertheless been independently found to be extremely signi\ufb01cant in RASopathy and cancer studies, e.g., [70]. Its role in this syndrome needs to 17 of 33 Entropy 2023, 25, 897 3. be re-evaluated given its in\ufb02uence on 347 biological pathways and its strong in\ufb02uence on speech. 16p11.2 and 16p12.2\u201316p11.2 (SRCAP): Although not implicated, it connects to only one other pathway in the ensemble, and that is the ACC pathway of FOXP2. The effects on speech are expected to be strong if this gene is aberrant. This gene may be implicated in further investigations. 17p13.1 (KDM6B): Speech is absent in this syndrome. The gene TP53 is impli- cated, which also appears at level-1 and is associated with 206 pathways. KDM6B is the only other gene in the level-1 voice chains and connects to only 8 other pathways. It is likely that this gene also plays a strong role in in\ufb02uencing speech and merits investigation. 17q12 (ERBB2): The gene ERBB2 is associated with 124 pathways.

This may be a result of biased sampling (the more severe cases may not be conducive to life due to other concurrent severe symptoms, which is a common occurrence in microdeletion syndromes; in some cases, only mosaic individuals survive). This warrants some investigation. 11p15.5 (HRAS): Although not implicated, and although two studies cited under OMIM: 130650 for this syndrome explicitly mention HRAS as not signi\ufb01cant, HRAS has nevertheless been independently found to be extremely signi\ufb01cant in RASopathy and cancer studies, e.g., [70]. Its role in this syndrome needs to 17 of 33 Entropy 2023, 25, 897 3. be re-evaluated given its in\ufb02uence on 347 biological pathways and its strong in\ufb02uence on speech. 16p11.2 and 16p12.2\u201316p11.2 (SRCAP): Although not implicated, it connects to only one other pathway in the ensemble, and that is the ACC pathway of FOXP2. The effects on speech are expected to be strong if this gene is aberrant. This gene may be implicated in further investigations. 17p13.1 (KDM6B): Speech is absent in this syndrome. The gene TP53 is impli- cated, which also appears at level-1 and is associated with 206 pathways. KDM6B is the only other gene in the level-1 voice chains and connects to only 8 other pathways. It is likely that this gene also plays a strong role in in\ufb02uencing speech and merits investigation. 17q12 (ERBB2): The gene ERBB2 is associated with 124 pathways. It is a well- known oncogene [71], in that perturbations in its function have been observed to have deleterious effects. If it is also connected to FOXP2, then its appearance in the voice chain allows a surprising hypothesis\u2014that biomarkers of some oncological conditions may also be present in voice. 19p13.3 (MAP2K2,UHRF1): MAP2K2 and URHF1 are not implicated. However their appearance as level-1 chainlink genes warrants investigation, especially for MAP2K2, which in\ufb02uences 257 pathways. Prompted by this, a literature search did reveal that MAP2K2 has been implicated in this syndrome recently [72], although this is not on the OMIM records, which were largely consulted for this study. 22q13.3 (BRD1): The gene BRD1 is not implicated and appears in 9 pathways only, but the effect on speech is severe in this syndrome. This warrants the inves- tigation of BRD1 independently in relation to speech characteristics. A literature search reveals that BRD1 is indeed strongly associated with brain development and susceptibility to both schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder [73], and consequent effects on speech are highly likely. Xp11.22 (SMC1A): Although SMC1A is not implicated, it appears in 33 pathways. The speech issues are severe and the gene warrants investigation for this effect. A recent report in the literature has implicated it in severe intellectual disability and therapy-resistant epilepsy in females [74]. The former is known to be associated with severe speech anomalies. Xp11.3 (KDM6A): Although not implicated, KDM6A warrants investigation. In the literature, it is independently known to be associated with delayed speech and psychomotor development [75]. Expression of speech"}], "doc_text": "chance. The remaining pathways are larger (in terms of the number of genes), and it is virtually impossible for them not to have a level-2 chain. As a result, it is realistic to expect that, as a consequence of the density with which the FOXP2 containing pathway is linked to other pathways, any syndrome arising from genetic aberrations that includes even a moderately sized set of genes will have an effect on voice. It remains a plausible hypothesis that any factor that in\ufb02uences gene function has at least some chance to ultimately affect voice\u2014for example, at least a 27% chance within the boundaries of the example presented in this paper. The above argument assumes that the genes in a microdeletion region are randomly chosen. The mean of the fraction of genes in a microdeletion that appears in any voice chain is observed to be 28.79% with a variance of 0.014, indicating concordance with the assumption of randomness. A secondary implication is that the likelihood of adjacent genes in the same cytogenetic region to be chainlink genes is independent of one another. 4.4. Ancillary Observations Some important ancillary observations emerge from this study, which may be impor- tant to note. These are mentioned brie\ufb02y below. 1. 2. For each syndrome, some genes have been identi\ufb01ed as largely important\u2014i.e., these are implicated largely for the syndrome\u2019s effect on the individual. Of the syndromes for which there is information about implicated genes, we see that in only 8 syndromes (2p16.1\u2013p15, 2q23.1, 9p24.3, 11q23, 13q12.3, 17q23.1\u2013q23.2, 19p13.13, and Yq11), none of the implicated genes appear in the two levels of voice chains shown. In all other cases, the implicated genes impact FOXP2 pathways and are likely to have a bearing on speech anomalies. We have noted earlier that FOXP2 is not the only gene known to be related to voice production. If we had chosen some other gene as an example in this paper (instead of FOXP2), it is likely that the implicated genes for the 8 exceptions mentioned above would appear as chainlink genes (while some others may not). This hypothesis can be easily tested in corresponding experiments. Identifying candidate genes for further investigation: Using only chainlink genes that appear on level-1 chains as illustrative examples (see Table A1 in the Appendix A for reference), we see that voice chains can be useful in identifying candidate genes for further investigation in the context of speech issues. Some examples are given below. The likely candidates are written in parentheses, while the already implicated genes are indicated in bold: 1p36 (ARID1A): Although not implicated for this syndrome in studies so far, ARID1A is located in 1p36.11, a region frequently deleted in human cancers [69]. Disruption in its function may lead to the co-occurrence of oncological and speech issues. This hypothesis is veri\ufb01able. 5q35.3 (NSD1): The gene NSD1 appears in a level-1 chain and is also an im- plicated gene. Ideally, this should not be a candidate for further investigation. However, paradoxically, while effects on speech are expected, the literature re- ports normal speech for some subjects for this case. This may be a result of biased sampling (the more severe cases may not be conducive to life due to other concurrent severe symptoms, which is a common occurrence in microdeletion syndromes; in some cases, only mosaic individuals survive). This warrants some investigation. 11p15.5 (HRAS): Although not implicated, and although two studies cited under OMIM: 130650 for this syndrome explicitly mention HRAS as not signi\ufb01cant, HRAS has nevertheless been independently found to be extremely signi\ufb01cant in RASopathy and cancer studies, e.g., [70].
