The median age was 55.0 years (IQR 47.0\u201363.0), 114 patients (87.7%) were male, the most common etiology of liver disease was chronic hepatitis B (84.6%), and 63 patients (48.5%) were MVI-positive. Edmondson grade III or IV was more common in the MVI-positive group than in the MVI-negative group. There were no other significant differences in the clinical or pathological characteristics between the two groups (Table 1).

Interobserver Agreement Regarding MRI Features The two radiologists showed moderate to excellent inter-observer agreement for the MRI features of HCC, with \u03ba values in the range of 0.431\u20130.885 (Table 2). The best interobserver agreement was observed for satellite nodule (\u03ba=0.885; 95% CI: 0.796\u20130.974). Moderate consistency was observed for peritumoral HBP hypointensity (\u03ba=0.511; 95% CI: 0.339\u2013 0.682). MRI Features of HCC That Identify MVI Status In univariate analysis, corona enhancement (P=0.021) and peritumoral HBP hypointensity (P=0.021) were more common in the MVI-positive group than in the MVI-negative group (Table 3).

(OR,3.019; 95% CI: 1.071\u20138.512; P=0.037) and peritumoral HBP hypointensity (OR, 3.019; 95% CI: 1.071\u20138.512; P=0.037) were independent predictors of MVI-positive status. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUROC of these two features for identifying MVI were 23.80%, 91.04%, 71.23%, 55.96%, and 0.574, respectively (representative images: Figure 2a and b). Characteristics of Patients Without Peritumoral HBP Hypointensity The median age of the 109 patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity was 56.0 years (IQR 49.0\u201364.0) and 94 (86.2%) were male. As in the entire study cohort, there were no significant differences in any of the clinical or pathological characteristics between the MVI-positive and MVI-negative groups in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, except for Edmondson grades III and IV (Table S3). In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the only significant difference in MRI features between the MVI- positive and MVI-negative groups was the presence of radiological capsule (Table 4).
