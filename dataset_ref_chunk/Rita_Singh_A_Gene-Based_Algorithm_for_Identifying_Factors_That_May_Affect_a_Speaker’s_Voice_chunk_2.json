We will use the term \u201cvocal production\u201d to refer to both. Vocal production in humans is a complex and multifaceted process and involves interactions between multiple genes and environmental factors. The genetic basis of vocal production is not fully understood. Nevertheless, a number of genes have been found to be involved in the process. Some that are now known to in\ufb02uence vocal production include: 1. 2. FOXP2: This gene codes for a protein called \u201cForkhead Box P2\u201d, which is involved in the development and function of the brain, including the areas responsible for language and speech. TAFT: This gene codes for a protein called TAFT1, which is involved in the develop- ment and function of the larynx, a structure in the throat that is involved in vocal production. 3. OTOF: This gene codes for a protein called Otoferlin, which is involved in the devel- opment and function of the auditory system, including the inner ear. Feedback from this system greatly in\ufb02uences vocal production. 4. MYO15A: This gene codes for a protein called Myosin XVa, which is involved in the development and function of the auditory system, including the hair cells in the inner ear. SEMA3A: This gene codes for a protein called Semaphorin 3A, which is involved in the development and function of the auditory system, including the auditory nerve. 5. 2 of 33 Entropy 2023, 25, 897 Recent efforts to identify and delineate the genes responsible for functional speech in humans have especially highlighted the importance of FOXP2, one of the protein-coding genes mentioned above. It is involved in a variety of biological pathways and cascades that are thought to regulate language development. It is autosomal dominant, and mutations in it cause speech and language disorders (OMIM: SPCH1). In this paper, we choose FOXP2 as an example gene to work with. This choice was only made for illustrative purposes. The methodology presented in its context is itself a generic one and can be applied to any of the genes listed above (and possibly others that exist) whose functions are relevant to the analysis at hand. For illustrative purposes, we proceeded with the broad and simplifying assumption that any in\ufb02uence on speech and language is ultimately the phenotypic expression of FOXP2. The objective was thus to: \u2022 \u2022 Formalize the methodology to \ufb01nd a link between an in\ufb02uencing factor and this gene; Validate the methodology; Demonstrate its predictive potential. To accomplish these goals, for simplicity, we chose the example of a category of medical conditions for which the underlying genetic causes are known; the effects of the conditions are observed and reported in medical literature, and the effects can involve problems with vocal production. The medical conditions we choose are chromosomal microdeletion syndromes, which result from the deletion of speci\ufb01c genes in speci\ufb01c cytogenetic locations on human chro- mosomes. We propose an algorithm to \ufb01nd a link between the genes in the regions of microdeletions, to FOXP2. The connections in these links are derived using a path-search algorithm applied to a graph composed from known biological pathways that involve these (and other) genes. The \u201cstrength\u201d of these connections is then de\ufb01ned in terms of the characteristics of the linkage discovered. In the validation stage, our goal is to show that there is a direct correlation between the strength of linkages found and the extent of vocal symptoms experienced by the affected individuals. Before we proceed with the algorithm, in the paragraphs below, we \ufb01rst provide a working categorization of speech disorders, as reported in various medical literature. This is necessary for the clarity of the results presented later in this paper. 1.2. Anomalies in Speech Production From a bio-mechanical perspective, human speech is the result of two complex pro- cesses that happen simultaneously: one that produces sound\u2014the pressure wave that we sense as the voice signal\u2014and another that modulates this signal (through articulator movements) to produce speech, thus altering the voice signal\u2019s frequency characteristics and shaping it into sounds with unique identities that are uttered sequentially to form words and sentences in a language. The overall process of voice and speech production is driven and controlled by neuromuscular and cognitive factors to different degrees. It is also moderated to different degrees by feedback obtained through auditory pathways. Generally, diseases that affect these functions, naturally also in\ufb02uence speech and alter the characteristics of the voice signal to proportional degrees. In most cases, when reporting such changes, references to \u201cspeech\u201d implicitly include voice, as we see below. Changes in speech are categorically described in terms of six major aspects of speech production: respiration, phonation, articulation, resonance, evolution, and prosody. In addition, terminology that relates to voice quality is often used to describe speech. Voice quality is, however, a subjective term and comprises many constituents, or sub-qualities (e.g., nasal, breathy, rough, twangy, etc.), that refer to the perceptual \ufb02avor of speech (or how a speaker\u2019s voice sounds to the listener). Physical anomalies that affect the shape and tissue structure of the vocal tract cause changes in all of these aspects. Speech delays and language dif\ufb01culties result from cognitive and learning disabilities. These and other intellectual disabilities affect articulation, evolution, and prosody. Their effect on voice also manifests as changes in voice quality. Craniofacial anomalies affect the physical dimensions 3 of 33 Entropy 2023, 25, 897 of the vocal tract structures, often restricting the movement of the articulators as a result and causing speaking impairments. Motor problems affect articulation, phonation, and respiration. These cause speech aberrations and also affect voice quality.

It is involved in a variety of biological pathways and cascades that are thought to regulate language development. It is autosomal dominant, and mutations in it cause speech and language disorders (OMIM: SPCH1). In this paper, we choose FOXP2 as an example gene to work with. This choice was only made for illustrative purposes. The methodology presented in its context is itself a generic one and can be applied to any of the genes listed above (and possibly others that exist) whose functions are relevant to the analysis at hand. For illustrative purposes, we proceeded with the broad and simplifying assumption that any in\ufb02uence on speech and language is ultimately the phenotypic expression of FOXP2. The objective was thus to: \u2022 \u2022 Formalize the methodology to \ufb01nd a link between an in\ufb02uencing factor and this gene; Validate the methodology; Demonstrate its predictive potential. To accomplish these goals, for simplicity, we chose the example of a category of medical conditions for which the underlying genetic causes are known; the effects of the conditions are observed and reported in medical literature, and the effects can involve problems with vocal production. The medical conditions we choose are chromosomal microdeletion syndromes, which result from the deletion of speci\ufb01c genes in speci\ufb01c cytogenetic locations on human chro- mosomes. We propose an algorithm to \ufb01nd a link between the genes in the regions of microdeletions, to FOXP2. The connections in these links are derived using a path-search algorithm applied to a graph composed from known biological pathways that involve these (and other) genes. The \u201cstrength\u201d of these connections is then de\ufb01ned in terms of the characteristics of the linkage discovered. In the validation stage, our goal is to show that there is a direct correlation between the strength of linkages found and the extent of vocal symptoms experienced by the affected individuals. Before we proceed with the algorithm, in the paragraphs below, we \ufb01rst provide a working categorization of speech disorders, as reported in various medical literature. This is necessary for the clarity of the results presented later in this paper. 1.2. Anomalies in Speech Production From a bio-mechanical perspective, human speech is the result of two complex pro- cesses that happen simultaneously: one that produces sound\u2014the pressure wave that we sense as the voice signal\u2014and another that modulates this signal (through articulator movements) to produce speech, thus altering the voice signal\u2019s frequency characteristics and shaping it into sounds with unique identities that are uttered sequentially to form words and sentences in a language. The overall process of voice and speech production is driven and controlled by neuromuscular and cognitive factors to different degrees. It is also moderated to different degrees by feedback obtained through auditory pathways. Generally, diseases that affect these functions, naturally also in\ufb02uence speech and alter the characteristics of the voice signal to proportional degrees. In most cases, when reporting such changes, references to \u201cspeech\u201d implicitly include voice, as we see below. Changes in speech are categorically described in terms of six major aspects of speech production: respiration, phonation, articulation, resonance, evolution, and prosody. In addition, terminology that relates to voice quality is often used to describe speech. Voice quality is, however, a subjective term and comprises many constituents, or sub-qualities (e.g., nasal, breathy, rough, twangy, etc.), that refer to the perceptual \ufb02avor of speech (or how a speaker\u2019s voice sounds to the listener). Physical anomalies that affect the shape and tissue structure of the vocal tract cause changes in all of these aspects. Speech delays and language dif\ufb01culties result from cognitive and learning disabilities. These and other intellectual disabilities affect articulation, evolution, and prosody. Their effect on voice also manifests as changes in voice quality. Craniofacial anomalies affect the physical dimensions 3 of 33 Entropy 2023, 25, 897 of the vocal tract structures, often restricting the movement of the articulators as a result and causing speaking impairments. Motor problems affect articulation, phonation, and respiration. These cause speech aberrations and also affect voice quality.

The connections in these links are derived using a path-search algorithm applied to a graph composed from known biological pathways that involve these (and other) genes. The \u201cstrength\u201d of these connections is then de\ufb01ned in terms of the characteristics of the linkage discovered. In the validation stage, our goal is to show that there is a direct correlation between the strength of linkages found and the extent of vocal symptoms experienced by the affected individuals. Before we proceed with the algorithm, in the paragraphs below, we \ufb01rst provide a working categorization of speech disorders, as reported in various medical literature. This is necessary for the clarity of the results presented later in this paper. 1.2. Anomalies in Speech Production From a bio-mechanical perspective, human speech is the result of two complex pro- cesses that happen simultaneously: one that produces sound\u2014the pressure wave that we sense as the voice signal\u2014and another that modulates this signal (through articulator movements) to produce speech, thus altering the voice signal\u2019s frequency characteristics and shaping it into sounds with unique identities that are uttered sequentially to form words and sentences in a language. The overall process of voice and speech production is driven and controlled by neuromuscular and cognitive factors to different degrees. It is also moderated to different degrees by feedback obtained through auditory pathways. Generally, diseases that affect these functions, naturally also in\ufb02uence speech and alter the characteristics of the voice signal to proportional degrees. In most cases, when reporting such changes, references to \u201cspeech\u201d implicitly include voice, as we see below. Changes in speech are categorically described in terms of six major aspects of speech production: respiration, phonation, articulation, resonance, evolution, and prosody. In addition, terminology that relates to voice quality is often used to describe speech. Voice quality is, however, a subjective term and comprises many constituents, or sub-qualities (e.g., nasal, breathy, rough, twangy, etc.), that refer to the perceptual \ufb02avor of speech (or how a speaker\u2019s voice sounds to the listener). Physical anomalies that affect the shape and tissue structure of the vocal tract cause changes in all of these aspects. Speech delays and language dif\ufb01culties result from cognitive and learning disabilities. These and other intellectual disabilities affect articulation, evolution, and prosody. Their effect on voice also manifests as changes in voice quality. Craniofacial anomalies affect the physical dimensions 3 of 33 Entropy 2023, 25, 897 of the vocal tract structures, often restricting the movement of the articulators as a result and causing speaking impairments. Motor problems affect articulation, phonation, and respiration. These cause speech aberrations and also affect voice quality. Hearing problems disturb the feedback mechanisms involved in controlling speech production and often lead to dif\ufb01culties in prosody and articulation of speech. In this paper, we do not focus explicitly on voice acoustic or quality"}
