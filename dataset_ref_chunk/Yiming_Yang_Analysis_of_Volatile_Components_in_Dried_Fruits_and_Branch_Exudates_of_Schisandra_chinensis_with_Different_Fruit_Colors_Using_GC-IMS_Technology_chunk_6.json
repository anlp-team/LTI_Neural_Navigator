Volatile com-ponents with special contributions were screened using p value < 0.05 and VIP value > 1 as the criteria for further data analysis. A total of 60 di\ufb00erent volatile chemical components were identi\ufb01ed in Schisandra branch exudates and dried fruits using GC-IMS. With 60 common components as depend-ent variables and dried fruits, branch exudates and di\ufb00erent fruit colors as independent variables divided into six groups, PCA-X and OPLS-DA analysis of samples of Schisandra dried fruits and branch exudates of di\ufb00erent colors can achieve e\ufb00ective di\ufb00erentiation. The volatile chemical components obtained were processed using PCA, resulting in the data shown in Figure 6. The R2X (1) = 0.648 and the R2X (2) = 0.13, indicating that the model samples have good reliability. It can be observed that there is a good distinction between the dried fruits and branch exudates, and the di\ufb00erences between di\ufb00erent groups are also noticeable. The data obtained from PCA was further processed and ana-lyzed. In the OPLS-DA analysis (Figures 7 and 8), the independent variable"}
