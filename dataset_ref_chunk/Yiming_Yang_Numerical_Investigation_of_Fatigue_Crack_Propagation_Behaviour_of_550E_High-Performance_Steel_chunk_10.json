A higher crack depth ratio easily leads to a higher K value, which, in turn, affects the structural life. The critical angle in the initial crack propagation process is 52.5\u25e6, and K is signi\ufb01cantly affected by the initial crack angle once this critical value is exceeded. When the initial crack angle is 0\u25e6, the crack tip stress is maximized, and fractures are most likely to occur.

The presence of a corrosion pit has little effect on crack propagation in the early stage of the corrosion pit, but the fatigue life of the specimen is obviously different when the crack passes through the corrosion pit.

When the initial crack angle is 0\u25e6, the crack tip stress is maximized, and fractures are most likely to occur.
