Estimating VFO Parameters from the Speech Signal: The Forward-Backward Approach (ADLES-VFT) The backward approach, solved by the ADLES algorithm in Section 4.1, derives the VFO parameters by minimizing the error between the output of the VFO model u0(t) and the glottal excitation ug(t). However, in general, ug(t) is not available, and this error cannot actually be computed. Instead, in the forward-backward approach, we further propagate the generated excita- tion u0(t) through the vocal tract, represented by the VT model of Equation (4) to obtain a signal uL(t) = u(L, t) at the lips. This is the output of the joint VFO and VT models. We compute the error between the generated signal uL(t) and the air velocity measurement de- rived from the recorded voice signal, which is available, and propagate this error backward through the vocal tract, to obtain the error at the glottis. The VT and VFO model parameters are estimated to minimize this error. Thus, the algorithm itself proceeds through iterations of two steps: a forward step in which the VFO-generated excitation is propagated through the VT model to generate an output signal, and a backward step in which the error between 10 of 39 (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 the generated signal and the recorded speech is propagated backward through the VT to adjust the model parameters. We explain the entire procedure below. The recorded voice signal is, in fact, a pressure wave and records the pressure wave emitted at the lips. Let pm(t) be the measured acoustic pressure at the lip. The correspond- ing volume velocity is given by [34] um(t) = A(L) \u03c1c pm(t) um(t) is now our reference signal at the lips to which uL(t) must be matched, in order to estimate model parameters. The propagation of u0(t) = u(0, t) through the vocal tract is assumed to follow the dynamics of Equation (4). Let H f be the nonlinear operator representing acoustic wave propagation through the vocal tract from the glottis to the lip. The subscript f in H f represents the vocal-tract pro\ufb01le f (x, t) in Equation (4) and indicates the dependence of H f on f (x, t). Thus the vocal-tract output uL(t) is given by uL(t) = H f (u0(t)) = H f ( \u02dccd(2\u03be0 + \u03bel(t) + \u03ber(t))) Our objective is to minimize the difference between the measured volume velocity um(t) and the predicted volume velocity uL(t) near the lip subject to constraint that the dynamics of the vocal folds must follow the VFO model of Equation (3). Note that the parameters of the joint model include the VFO model parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u2206, and the vocal tract pro\ufb01le f (x, t) required by the VT model. Although we only require the VFO model parameters to determine vocal fold oscillation, the minimization must be performed against all of these.

Estimating VFO Parameters from the Speech Signal: The Forward-Backward Approach (ADLES-VFT) The backward approach, solved by the ADLES algorithm in Section 4.1, derives the VFO parameters by minimizing the error between the output of the VFO model u0(t) and the glottal excitation ug(t). However, in general, ug(t) is not available, and this error cannot actually be computed. Instead, in the forward-backward approach, we further propagate the generated excita- tion u0(t) through the vocal tract, represented by the VT model of Equation (4) to obtain a signal uL(t) = u(L, t) at the lips. This is the output of the joint VFO and VT models. We compute the error between the generated signal uL(t) and the air velocity measurement de- rived from the recorded voice signal, which is available, and propagate this error backward through the vocal tract, to obtain the error at the glottis. The VT and VFO model parameters are estimated to minimize this error. Thus, the algorithm itself proceeds through iterations of two steps: a forward step in which the VFO-generated excitation is propagated through the VT model to generate an output signal, and a backward step in which the error between 10 of 39 (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 the generated signal and the recorded speech is propagated backward through the VT to adjust the model parameters. We explain the entire procedure below. The recorded voice signal is, in fact, a pressure wave and records the pressure wave emitted at the lips. Let pm(t) be the measured acoustic pressure at the lip. The correspond- ing volume velocity is given by [34] um(t) = A(L) \u03c1c pm(t) um(t) is now our reference signal at the lips to which uL(t) must be matched, in order to estimate model parameters. The propagation of u0(t) = u(0, t) through the vocal tract is assumed to follow the dynamics of Equation (4). Let H f be the nonlinear operator representing acoustic wave propagation through the vocal tract from the glottis to the lip. The subscript f in H f represents the vocal-tract pro\ufb01le f (x, t) in Equation (4) and indicates the dependence of H f on f (x, t). Thus the vocal-tract output uL(t) is given by uL(t) = H f (u0(t)) = H f ( \u02dccd(2\u03be0 + \u03bel(t) + \u03ber(t))) Our objective is to minimize the difference between the measured volume velocity um(t) and the predicted volume velocity uL(t) near the lip subject to constraint that the dynamics of the vocal folds must follow the VFO model of Equation (3). Note that the parameters of the joint model include the VFO model parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u2206, and the vocal tract pro\ufb01le f (x, t) required by the VT model. Although we only require the VFO model parameters to determine vocal fold oscillation, the minimization must be performed against all of these.

Estimating VFO Parameters from the Speech Signal: The Forward-Backward Approach (ADLES-VFT) The backward approach, solved by the ADLES algorithm in Section 4.1, derives the VFO parameters by minimizing the error between the output of the VFO model u0(t) and the glottal excitation ug(t). However, in general, ug(t) is not available, and this error cannot actually be computed. Instead, in the forward-backward approach, we further propagate the generated excita- tion u0(t) through the vocal tract, represented by the VT model of Equation (4) to obtain a signal uL(t) = u(L, t) at the lips. This is the output of the joint VFO and VT models. We compute the error between the generated signal uL(t) and the air velocity measurement de- rived from the recorded voice signal, which is available, and propagate this error backward through the vocal tract, to obtain the error at the glottis. The VT and VFO model parameters are estimated to minimize this error. Thus, the algorithm itself proceeds through iterations of two steps: a forward step in which the VFO-generated excitation is propagated through the VT model to generate an output signal, and a backward step in which the error between 10 of 39 (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 the generated signal and the recorded speech is propagated backward through the VT to adjust the model parameters. We explain the entire procedure below. The recorded voice signal is, in fact, a pressure wave and records the pressure wave emitted at the lips. Let pm(t) be the measured acoustic pressure at the lip. The correspond- ing volume velocity is given by [34] um(t) = A(L) \u03c1c pm(t) um(t) is now our reference signal at the lips to which uL(t) must be matched, in order to estimate model parameters. The propagation of u0(t) = u(0, t) through the vocal tract is assumed to follow the dynamics of Equation (4). Let H f be the nonlinear operator representing acoustic wave propagation through the vocal tract from the glottis to the lip. The subscript f in H f represents the vocal-tract pro\ufb01le f (x, t) in Equation (4) and indicates the dependence of H f on f (x, t). Thus the vocal-tract output uL(t) is given by uL(t) = H f (u0(t)) = H f ( \u02dccd(2\u03be0 + \u03bel(t) + \u03ber(t))) Our objective is to minimize the difference between the measured volume velocity um(t) and the predicted volume velocity uL(t) near the lip subject to constraint that the dynamics of the vocal folds must follow the VFO model of Equation (3). Note that the parameters of the joint model include the VFO model parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u2206, and the vocal tract pro\ufb01le f (x, t) required by the VT model. Although we only require the VFO model parameters to determine vocal fold oscillation, the minimization must be performed against all of these.

Estimating VFO Parameters from the Speech Signal: The Forward-Backward Approach (ADLES-VFT) The backward approach, solved by the ADLES algorithm in Section 4.1, derives the VFO parameters by minimizing the error between the output of the VFO model u0(t) and the glottal excitation ug(t). However, in general, ug(t) is not available, and this error cannot actually be computed. Instead, in the forward-backward approach, we further propagate the generated excita- tion u0(t) through the vocal tract, represented by the VT model of Equation (4) to obtain a signal uL(t) = u(L, t) at the lips. This is the output of the joint VFO and VT models. We compute the error between the generated signal uL(t) and the air velocity measurement de- rived from the recorded voice signal, which is available, and propagate this error backward through the vocal tract, to obtain the error at the glottis. The VT and VFO model parameters are estimated to minimize this error. Thus, the algorithm itself proceeds through iterations of two steps: a forward step in which the VFO-generated excitation is propagated through the VT model to generate an output signal, and a backward step in which the error between 10 of 39 (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 the generated signal and the recorded speech is propagated backward through the VT to adjust the model parameters. We explain the entire procedure below. The recorded voice signal is, in fact, a pressure wave and records the pressure wave emitted at the lips. Let pm(t) be the measured acoustic pressure at the lip. The correspond- ing volume velocity is given by [34] um(t) = A(L) \u03c1c pm(t) um(t) is now our reference signal at the lips to which uL(t) must be matched, in order to estimate model parameters. The propagation of u0(t) = u(0, t) through the vocal tract is assumed to follow the dynamics of Equation (4). Let H f be the nonlinear operator representing acoustic wave propagation through the vocal tract from the glottis to the lip. The subscript f in H f represents the vocal-tract pro\ufb01le f (x, t) in Equation (4) and indicates the dependence of H f on f (x, t). Thus the vocal-tract output uL(t) is given by uL(t) = H f (u0(t)) = H f ( \u02dccd(2\u03be0 + \u03bel(t) + \u03ber(t))) Our objective is to minimize the difference between the measured volume velocity um(t) and the predicted volume velocity uL(t) near the lip subject to constraint that the dynamics of the vocal folds must follow the VFO model of Equation (3). Note that the parameters of the joint model include the VFO model parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u2206, and the vocal tract pro\ufb01le f (x, t) required by the VT model. Although we only require the VFO model parameters to determine vocal fold oscillation, the minimization must be performed against all of these.

The minimization is performed against the complete set of parameters of the joint VFO-VT model, i.e., \u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206 and f (x, t).

To solve the optimization problem of (29)\u2013(35), we derive an ef\ufb01cient gradient-descent solution which we term the ADLES-VFT algorithm. The essential steps of the solution are given below.
