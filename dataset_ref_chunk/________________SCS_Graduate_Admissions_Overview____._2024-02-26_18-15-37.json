We offer a wide range of professional and academic Ph.D. and master's programs across our seven departments. Admissions and requirements vary by program and are determined by the program's home department. You can apply to up to three of our Ph.D. programs and any of our master\u2019s programs.\n\nImportant Information for Programs Beginning in Fall 2024\n\nApplication Opens: Sept. 6, 2023 Application Deadline: All applicant materials must be submitted by the deadline below, and application fees must be paid by these deadlines. Early Deadline: Nov. 29, 2023 (3 p.m. EST) Final Deadline: Dec. 13, 2023 (3 p.m. EST) If you submit your application early, your recommenders still have until Dec. 13, 2023, to submit recommendations. TOEFL, IELTS & GRE Deadlines: If you need to take/retake your TOEFL, IELTS and/or GRE for this application, we highly recommend you take the exam no later than Nov. 29, 2023. Reportable scores can take two weeks to process, and we may not be able to review any scores that arrive after our Dec. 13, 2023, deadline. If you will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and English is not a native language for you (native language\u2026meaning spoken at home and from birth), an official copy of an English proficiency score report is required. The English proficiency requirement cannot be waived for any reason. Find more information under \"Test Scores\" on our FAQ page. GRE & TOEFL Codes GRE Report Codes: Institution Code - 2074, Department Code - 0402 TOEFL Report Codes: Institution Code - 4256, Department Code - 78\n\nNote: Some of our programs follow different deadlines, see application information and links below for more information.\n\nHelpful Links\n\nGraduate Admissions Overview\n\nApplication Instructions\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nMaster's Programs\n\nDoctoral Programs\n\nProgram Leadership\n\nSCS Graduate Admission Applications\n\nUse the links below to apply to the program(s) of your choice.\n\nSCS Doctoral Programs\n\nPh.D. Application for Computational Biology, Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, Societal Computing, Software Engineering and Robotics\n\nPh.D. Application for Language and Information Technologies\n\nNote : To apply to the doctoral track in Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization (ACO) or in Pure and Applied Logic (PAL) , you must apply to the Ph.D. program in Computer Science .
