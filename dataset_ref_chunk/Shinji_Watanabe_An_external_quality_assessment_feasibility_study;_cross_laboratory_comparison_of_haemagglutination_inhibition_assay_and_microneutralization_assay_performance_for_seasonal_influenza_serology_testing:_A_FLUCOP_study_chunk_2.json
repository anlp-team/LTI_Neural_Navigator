The ECDC/WHO run a European External In\ufb02uenza Virus Quality Assessment Programme, which assesses virus isolation, antigenic and genetic characterization methods (1). In the ECDC/WHO EQA serology methods are used to type and identify unknown strains of in\ufb02uenza. This assesses the qualitative results of Haemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) testing using monospeci\ufb01c ferret sera and is aimed at virus identi\ufb01cation. However testing for quantifying antibodies in human sera is not assessed. When using serology assays to de\ufb01ne antibody correlates of protection, accurate and quantitative results are of the highest importance. FLUCOP (http://www.FLUCOP.eu/) is a joint European project between academia, vaccine manufacturers and public health authorities, supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMIJU) aimed at standardizing serological assays and developing harmonized protocols for evaluating in\ufb02uenza vaccines. The goal of the FLUCOP project is to have a direct and evidence- based impact on the quality of regulatory decisions and to provide valid and appropriate serological tools for the future de\ufb01nition of alternative correlates of protection for (novel) in\ufb02uenza vaccines. The consortium has made considerable progress with standardization of the HAI assay and Enzyme-Linked-Lectin Assay (ELLA) with large collaborative studies carried out and freely available published SOPs (2, 3). Additionally collaborative studies to standardize the Microneutralization (MN) assay have also been carried out (manuscript in preparation). Alongside large studies testing harmonized serology assay protocols and the impact of biological standards on inter-lab variability, the FLUCOP consortium set up an EQA feasibility Frontiers in Immunology 02 frontiersin.org Waldock et al. study. In this study we assessed two common assays used for in\ufb02uenza serology: the HAI and MN assays. Participants were asked to test a provided panel of 30 serum samples using four seasonal in\ufb02uenza viruses. This study aimed to determine interest in EQA schemes for in\ufb02uenza serology testing, provide a snapshot of inter-laboratory variation outside the limits of the FLUCOP consortium, assess the use of a serum standard to reduce inter- laboratory variation and provide useful feedback to participants for identifying issues and improving pro\ufb01ciency. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Participating laboratories 42 Laboratories were invited to participate in the EQA feasibility study. Invited laboratories were from industry, contract research organizations (CROs), academia and public health institutions who regularly conduct HAI and MN testing and have an interest in serology standardization. We received a positive response from 17 participants (a number likely negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic). 2.2 Serum panels and serum standards Participants were provided with a panel of 30 samples by the University of Ghent. Each panel consisted of 3 pre and 20 post- vaccination human sera (FLUCOP_QIV clinical trial, Fluarix Tetra vaccine containing the following in\ufb02uenza strains: A/Michigan/45/ 2015 (H1N1)pdm09, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2), B/ Brisbane/60/2008 and B/Phuket/3073/2013 samples), 4 duplicated samples (for assessing within-run variability), 2 serum standards and a negative control. The two serum standards included in the study were pools of equal volumes of 4 post-vaccination human serum samples (FLUCOP_QIV clinical trial, Fluarix Tetra vaccine) all of which have med-high titres for all tested in\ufb02uenza A subtype and B lineage viruses. These serum standards were used as calibrators to normalise data from each laboratory (i.e. normalised titres from each testing laboratory are expressed relative to the titre of the serum standard, see statistical analysis). Prior to this study serum samples were pre-screened in HAI/MN and selected to cover a large range in titres. All sera were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 1 hour. An IgA/IgM/IgG depleted human sera was used as a negative control (Sigma-Aldrich S5393). 2.3 Serological testing Participants were asked to test the serum panel with four seasonal in\ufb02uenza viruses. They were asked where possible to use reassortant viruses IVR-180 (H1N1), NYMC-X263B (H3N2), NYMC-BX35 (B Victoria lineage) and NYMC-BX59A (B Yamagata lineage). Antigenically identical wild type (WT) viruses were also considered acceptable for testing. Participants were asked to carry out three independent replicates using any or all of the Frontiers in Immunology 03 10.3389/\ufb01mmu.2023.1129765 following: In-house or FLUCOP protocols for HAI testing (2); In- house or the WHO protocol for 2-day ELISA-based MN testing (4); In-house or FLUCOP protocols for 3-day+ MN testing (available upon request). Serum panels were shipped in August/September 2021. Each laboratory returning data was assigned a number (and a colour for all graphical representations of data); each laboratory was only given their own number and colour, thus anonymizing the results from participating laboratories. 2.4 Statistical analysis As HAI and some MN methods return discrete data within a speci\ufb01c dynamic range, results are often reported as <10 or >(upper assay limit) e.g.>1280. Data returned indicating <t were assigned the value 1/2t, data returned indicating >t were assigned the value 2*t. Intra-assay (within-run) variability was assessed using maximum- minimum ratios of four coded duplicate samples included in the serum panel. Intra-laboratory (between-run) variation was assessed using maximum-minimum ratios of the 3 independent replicates returned for HAI (with the exception of Lab no.13 where only 2 replicate runs were returned) or 2-3 independent replicates for MN (Labs no.7/10/11 returned two replicate runs). Any sample with a ratio greater than 3.5 was excluded from inter-laboratory (between- laboratories) comparisons. Any sample with a Geometric Mean Titre (GMT) <10 was excluded from statistical analysis (shown on graphs for information only). Sample titres were log10 transformed and % Geometric Coef\ufb01cient of Variation (GCV) calculated using the following equation: (10s-1)x100% where s is the standard deviation of the log10 titres. %GCVs were statistically compared using the Wilcoxon matched paired t test (comparison of raw and normalized titres) or Mann-Whitney U test (comparison of native and ether split B antigen titres). Geometric Mean Ratios (GMRs) were calculated as the titre of a sample/a reference titre. For overall inter-laboratory variability the reference titre is the GMT of that sample across all testing laboratories (after data exclusion as described above). For comparisons of in-house and FLUCOP protocols, the reference titre is the GMT of that sample tested with the appropriate protocol (i.e. the GMT of a sample across all laboratories testing with the FLUCOP protocol,"}, {"question": " Why is testing for quantifying antibodies in human sera not assessed in the ECDC/WHO EQA?", "answer": " Because accurate and quantitative results are of the highest importance when using serology assays to define antibody correlates of protection.", "ref_chunk": "far as the authors of this paper are aware.

Prior to this study serum samples were pre-screened in HAI/MN and selected to cover a large range in titres. All sera were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 1 hour. An IgA/IgM/IgG depleted human sera was used as a negative control (Sigma-Aldrich S5393). 2.3 Serological testing Participants were asked to test the serum panel with four seasonal in\ufb02uenza viruses. They were asked where possible to use reassortant viruses IVR-180 (H1N1), NYMC-X263B (H3N2), NYMC-BX35 (B Victoria lineage) and NYMC-BX59A (B Yamagata lineage). Antigenically identical wild type (WT) viruses were also considered acceptable for testing. Participants were asked to carry out three independent replicates using any or all of the Frontiers in Immunology 03 10.3389/\ufb01mmu.2023.1129765 following: In-house or FLUCOP protocols for HAI testing (2); In- house or the WHO protocol for 2-day ELISA-based MN testing (4); In-house or FLUCOP protocols for 3-day+ MN testing (available upon request). Serum panels were shipped in August/September 2021. Each laboratory returning data was assigned a number (and a colour for all graphical representations of data); each laboratory was only given their own number and colour, thus anonymizing the results from participating laboratories. 2.4 Statistical analysis As HAI and some MN methods return discrete data within a speci\ufb01c dynamic range, results are often reported as <10 or >(upper assay limit) e.g.>1280. Data returned indicating <t were assigned the value 1/2t, data returned indicating >t were assigned the value 2*t. Intra-assay (within-run) variability was assessed using maximum- minimum ratios of four coded duplicate samples included in the serum panel. Intra-laboratory (between-run) variation was assessed using maximum-minimum ratios of the 3 independent replicates returned for HAI (with the exception of Lab no.13 where only 2 replicate runs were returned) or 2-3 independent replicates for MN (Labs no.7/10/11 returned two replicate runs). Any sample with a ratio greater than 3.5 was excluded from inter-laboratory (between- laboratories) comparisons. Any sample with a Geometric Mean Titre (GMT) <10 was excluded from statistical analysis (shown on graphs for information only). Sample titres were log10 transformed and % Geometric Coef\ufb01cient of Variation (GCV) calculated using the following equation: (10s-1)x100% where s is the standard deviation of the log10 titres. %GCVs were statistically compared using the Wilcoxon matched paired t test (comparison of raw and normalized titres) or Mann-Whitney U test (comparison of native and ether split B antigen titres). Geometric Mean Ratios (GMRs) were calculated as the titre of a sample/a reference titre. For overall inter-laboratory variability the reference titre is the GMT of that sample across all testing laboratories (after data exclusion as described above). For comparisons of in-house and FLUCOP protocols, the reference titre is the GMT of that sample tested with the appropriate protocol (i.e. the GMT of a sample across all laboratories testing with the FLUCOP protocol,"}, {"question": " How many laboratories were invited to participate in the EQA feasibility study?", "answer": " 42 laboratories.", "ref_chunk": "far as the authors of this paper are aware.

FLUCOP (http://www.FLUCOP.eu/) is a joint European project between academia, vaccine manufacturers and public health authorities, supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMIJU) aimed at standardizing serological assays and developing harmonized protocols for evaluating in\ufb02uenza vaccines. The goal of the FLUCOP project is to have a direct and evidence- based impact on the quality of regulatory decisions and to provide valid and appropriate serological tools for the future de\ufb01nition of alternative correlates of protection for (novel) in\ufb02uenza vaccines. The consortium has made considerable progress with standardization of the HAI assay and Enzyme-Linked-Lectin Assay (ELLA) with large collaborative studies carried out and freely available published SOPs (2, 3). Additionally collaborative studies to standardize the Microneutralization (MN) assay have also been carried out (manuscript in preparation). Alongside large studies testing harmonized serology assay protocols and the impact of biological standards on inter-lab variability, the FLUCOP consortium set up an EQA feasibility Frontiers in Immunology 02 frontiersin.org Waldock et al. study. In this study we assessed two common assays used for in\ufb02uenza serology: the HAI and MN assays. Participants were asked to test a provided panel of 30 serum samples using four seasonal in\ufb02uenza viruses. This study aimed to determine interest in EQA schemes for in\ufb02uenza serology testing, provide a snapshot of inter-laboratory variation outside the limits of the FLUCOP consortium, assess the use of a serum standard to reduce inter- laboratory variation and provide useful feedback to participants for identifying issues and improving pro\ufb01ciency. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Participating laboratories 42 Laboratories were invited to participate in the EQA feasibility study. Invited laboratories were from industry, contract research organizations (CROs), academia and public health institutions who regularly conduct HAI and MN testing and have an interest in serology standardization. We received a positive response from 17 participants (a number likely negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic). 2.2 Serum panels and serum standards Participants were provided with a panel of 30 samples by the University of Ghent. Each panel consisted of 3 pre and 20 post- vaccination human sera (FLUCOP_QIV clinical trial, Fluarix Tetra vaccine containing the following in\ufb02uenza strains: A/Michigan/45/ 2015 (H1N1)pdm09, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2), B/ Brisbane/60/2008 and B/Phuket/3073/2013 samples), 4 duplicated samples (for assessing within-run variability), 2 serum standards and a negative control. The two serum standards included in the study were pools of equal volumes of 4 post-vaccination human serum samples (FLUCOP_QIV clinical trial, Fluarix Tetra vaccine) all of which have med-high titres for all tested in\ufb02uenza A subtype and B lineage viruses. These serum standards were used as calibrators to normalise data from each laboratory (i.e. normalised titres from each testing laboratory are expressed relative to the titre of the serum standard, see statistical analysis). Prior to this study serum samples were pre-screened in HAI/MN and selected to cover a large range in titres. All sera were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 1 hour. An IgA/IgM/IgG depleted human sera was used as a negative control (Sigma-Aldrich S5393). 2.3 Serological testing Participants were asked to test the serum panel with four seasonal in\ufb02uenza viruses. They were asked where possible to use reassortant viruses IVR-180 (H1N1), NYMC-X263B (H3N2), NYMC-BX35 (B Victoria lineage) and NYMC-BX59A (B Yamagata lineage). Antigenically identical wild type (WT) viruses were also considered acceptable for testing. Participants were asked to carry out three independent replicates using any or all of the Frontiers in Immunology 03 10.3389/\ufb01mmu.2023.1129765 following: In-house or FLUCOP protocols for HAI testing (2); In- house or the WHO protocol for 2-day ELISA-based MN testing (4); In-house or FLUCOP protocols for 3-day+ MN testing (available upon request). Serum panels were shipped in August/September 2021. Each laboratory returning data was assigned a number (and a colour for all graphical representations of data); each laboratory was only given their own number and colour, thus anonymizing the results from participating laboratories. 2.4 Statistical analysis As HAI and some MN methods return discrete data within a speci\ufb01c dynamic range, results are often reported as <10 or >(upper assay limit) e.g.>1280. Data returned indicating <t were assigned the value 1/2t, data returned indicating >t were assigned the value 2*t. Intra-assay (within-run) variability was assessed using maximum- minimum ratios of four coded duplicate samples included in the serum panel. Intra-laboratory (between-run) variation was assessed using maximum-minimum ratios of the 3 independent replicates returned for HAI (with the exception of Lab no.13 where only 2 replicate runs were returned) or 2-3 independent replicates for MN (Labs no.7/10/11 returned two replicate runs). Any sample with a ratio greater than 3.5 was excluded from inter-laboratory (between- laboratories) comparisons. Any sample with a Geometric Mean Titre (GMT) <10 was excluded from statistical analysis (shown on graphs for information only). Sample titres were log10 transformed and % Geometric Coef\ufb01cient of Variation (GCV) calculated using the following equation: (10s-1)x100% where s is the standard deviation of the log10 titres. %GCVs were statistically compared using the Wilcoxon matched paired t test (comparison of raw and normalized titres) or Mann-Whitney U test (comparison of native and ether split B antigen titres). Geometric Mean Ratios (GMRs) were calculated as the titre of a sample/a reference titre. For overall inter-laboratory variability the reference titre is the GMT of that sample across all testing laboratories (after data exclusion as described above). For comparisons of in-house and FLUCOP protocols, the reference titre is the GMT of that sample tested with the appropriate protocol (i.e. the GMT of a sample across all laboratories testing with the FLUCOP protocol,"}], "doc_text": "far as the authors of this paper are aware.
