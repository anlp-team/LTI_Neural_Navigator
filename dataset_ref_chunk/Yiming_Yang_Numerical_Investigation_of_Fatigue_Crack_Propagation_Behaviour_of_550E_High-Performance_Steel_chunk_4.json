As shown in this \ufb01gure, the crack growth rates of the corroded specimens can be roughly divided into three stages in the logarithmic coordinate system, i.e., Stage I of initial crack growth, Stage II of the crack passing through the pit, and Stage Table 3.

When the crack growth length reaches 12 mm, the crack reaches the edge of the corrosion pit, and the crack growth rate then suddenly changes and enters Stage II. When the crack length reaches 16mm, the crack propagation completely passes through the corrosion pit, and the crack propagation of the specimen reaches a stable stage. The fatigue crack propagation rate is linearly related to the stress intensity factor in the logarithmic coordinate system. The crack growth rate of Q550E in Zones I and II is signi\ufb01cantly higher than that of Q235. Once the crack propagates through the corrosion pit, the crack propagation rate of Q550E is slightly higher. (a) (b) Figure 7. Comparison of crack growth rates: (a) Intact; (b) Corroded. 4. Numerical Investigations 4.1. Finite Element Model A \ufb01nite element model was developed by using the commercial software ANSYS workbench. The specimen size, material parameters, and load of the \ufb01nite element model were consistent with those of the crack propagation test. A tetrahedral mesh and Solid185 elements were adopted, and the overall mesh accuracy was set to 1.5 mm. For a more realistic simulation and considering the requirements of time and accuracy, an in\ufb02uence ball with a radius of 6 mm and a mesh precision of 0.4 mm was set at the crack tip for mesh re\ufb01nement, as shown in Figure 8. Smart crack growth simulation was adopted in the mesh processing. This process is based on mesh division that simulates the features of fatigue or crack growth morphology in engineering"}
