Table 2 shows the mean absolute error (MAE) of calculating glottal \ufb02ows and parameters for four voice types (normal, neo- plasm, phonotrauma, vocal palsy) obtained by backward (ADLES) and forward-backward (ADLES-VFT) algorithms. The glottal \ufb02ows obtained by inverse \ufb01ltering the speech signals are treated as ground truths. Since there is no ground truth for model parameters, we treat the parameters obtained by ADLES as ground truth.

Examples of features in this category are recurrence 18 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 analysis features, Lyapunov exponents, Hurst exponents, etc. These are mentioned in Appendix F. Some of these features have been used in real-world applications and proven to be effective. For example, in [39], the authors hypothesize that since COVID-19 impairs the respiratory system, effects on the phonation process could be expected, and signatures of COVID-19 could manifest in the vibration patterns of the vocal folds. In this paper, features have been derived from a signal processing perspective. This study used the ADLES method to estimate the asymmetric vocal folds model parameters. It further used the parameters and estimation residuals as features to other binary classi\ufb01ers such as logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and ran- dom forest, achieving around 0.8 ROC-AUC (area under the ROC curve) in discriminating positive COVID-19 cases from negative instances, on clinically collected and curated data. The data used contained recordings of extended vowel sounds from affected speakers and control subjects. The authors also discovered that COVID-19 positive individuals display different phase space behaviors from negative individuals: the phase space trajectories for negative individuals were found to be more regular and symmetric across the two vocal folds, while the trajectories for positive patients were more chaotic, implying a lack of synchronization and a higher degree of asymmetry in the vibrations of the left and right vocal folds. In a companion study, the authors in [40] used the ADLES-estimated glottal \ufb02ows as features to CNN-based two-step attention neural networks. The neural model detects differences in the estimated and actual glottal \ufb02ows and predicts two classes corresponding to COVID-19 positive and negative cases. This achieved 0.9 ROC-AUC (normalized) on clinically collected vowel sounds. Yet another study used higher order statistics derived from parameters, and Lyapunov and Hurst exponents derived from the phase space trajec- tories of the individualized asymmetric models, to detect Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) from voice with high accuracy (normalized ROC-AUC of 0.82 to 0.99) [41]. 6. Conclusions and Future Directions In this paper we have presented a dynamical system perspective for physical process modeling and phase space characterization of phonation, and proposed a framework wherein these can be derived for individual speakers from recorded speech samples. The oscillatory dynamics of vocal folds provide a tool to analyze different phonation phenomena in many real-world task settings. We have proposed a backward approach for modeling vocal fold dynamics, and an ef\ufb01cient algorithm (the ADLES algorithm) to solve the inverse problem of estimating model parameters from speech observations. Further, we have integrated the vocal tract and vocal folds models, and have presented a forward- backward paradigm (the ADLES-VFT algorithm) for effectively solving the inverse problem for the coupled vocal fold-tract model. Extensions of these approaches can use other physical models of voice production, and other physical processes including phonation. We have shown that the parameters estimated by these algorithms allow the models to closely emulate the vocal fold motion of individual speakers.

These results suggest that our forward-backward algorithm can effectively recover the vocal tract pro\ufb01le, glottal \ufb02ow, and model parameters. Table 2.

Examples of features in this category are recurrence 18 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 analysis features, Lyapunov exponents, Hurst exponents, etc. These are mentioned in Appendix F. Some of these features have been used in real-world applications and proven to be effective. For example, in [39], the authors hypothesize that since COVID-19 impairs the respiratory system, effects on the phonation process could be expected, and signatures of COVID-19 could manifest in the vibration patterns of the vocal folds. In this paper, features have been derived from a signal processing perspective. This study used the ADLES method to estimate the asymmetric vocal folds model parameters. It further used the parameters and estimation residuals as features to other binary classi\ufb01ers such as logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and ran- dom forest, achieving around 0.8 ROC-AUC (area under the ROC curve) in discriminating positive COVID-19 cases from negative instances, on clinically collected and curated data. The data used contained recordings of extended vowel sounds from affected speakers and control subjects. The authors also discovered that COVID-19 positive individuals display different phase space behaviors from negative individuals: the phase space trajectories for negative individuals were found to be more regular and symmetric across the two vocal folds, while the trajectories for positive patients were more chaotic, implying a lack of synchronization and a higher degree of asymmetry in the vibrations of the left and right vocal folds. In a companion study, the authors in [40] used the ADLES-estimated glottal \ufb02ows as features to CNN-based two-step attention neural networks. The neural model detects differences in the estimated and actual glottal \ufb02ows and predicts two classes corresponding to COVID-19 positive and negative cases. This achieved 0.9 ROC-AUC (normalized) on clinically collected vowel sounds. Yet another study used higher order statistics derived from parameters, and Lyapunov and Hurst exponents derived from the phase space trajec- tories of the individualized asymmetric models, to detect Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) from voice with high accuracy (normalized ROC-AUC of 0.82 to 0.99) [41]. 6. Conclusions and Future Directions In this paper we have presented a dynamical system perspective for physical process modeling and phase space characterization of phonation, and proposed a framework wherein these can be derived for individual speakers from recorded speech samples. The oscillatory dynamics of vocal folds provide a tool to analyze different phonation phenomena in many real-world task settings. We have proposed a backward approach for modeling vocal fold dynamics, and an ef\ufb01cient algorithm (the ADLES algorithm) to solve the inverse problem of estimating model parameters from speech observations. Further, we have integrated the vocal tract and vocal folds models, and have presented a forward- backward paradigm (the ADLES-VFT algorithm) for effectively solving the inverse problem for the coupled vocal fold-tract model. Extensions of these approaches can use other physical models of voice production, and other physical processes including phonation. We have shown that the parameters estimated by these algorithms allow the models to closely emulate the vocal fold motion of individual speakers.

The rationale behind this is that within reasonable bounds of error, the glottal \ufb02ow signal obtained through our model is expected to conform to the oscillation patterns seen in the excitation signal for each speaker. Figure 7 shows the glottal \ufb02ow obtained by inverse \ufb01ltering and those obtained by the asymmetric model with the parameters estimated by our ADLES method.

We have proposed a backward approach for modeling vocal fold dynamics, and an ef\ufb01cient algorithm (the ADLES algorithm) to solve the inverse problem of estimating model parameters from speech observations. Further, we have integrated the vocal tract and vocal folds models, and have presented a forward- backward paradigm (the ADLES-VFT algorithm) for effectively solving the inverse problem for the coupled vocal fold-tract model. Extensions of these approaches can use other physical models of voice production, and other physical processes including phonation. We have shown that the parameters estimated by these algorithms allow the models to closely emulate the vocal fold motion of individual speakers. Features and statistics derived from the"}], "doc_text": "representing distinct vocal fold behaviors and thereby indicating different voice pathologies. By extracting the phase trajectories for the speech signal and, thereby, the underlying system parameters, the ADLES algorithm can place the vocal-fold oscillations in voice production on the bifurcation diagram and thus deduce the pathology. 16 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 17 of 39 (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 6.

Validation 2 Our second validation approach is to compare the excitation signal obtained through inverse \ufb01ltering with the glottal \ufb02ow signal (VFO) obtained through the backward or forward-backward algorithm. The rationale behind this is that within reasonable bounds of error, the glottal \ufb02ow signal obtained through our model is expected to conform to the oscillation patterns seen in the excitation signal for each speaker. Figure 7 shows the glottal \ufb02ow obtained by inverse \ufb01ltering and those obtained by the asymmetric model with the parameters estimated by our ADLES method. We observe consistent matches, showing that the ADLES algorithm does achieve its objectives in individualizing the asymmetric model to each speaker instance.

Validation 3 Our third validation approach is to compare the estimation precision of the back- ward approach and the forward-backward approach. Table 2 shows the mean absolute error (MAE) of calculating glottal \ufb02ows and parameters for four voice types (normal, neo- plasm, phonotrauma, vocal palsy) obtained by backward (ADLES) and forward-backward (ADLES-VFT) algorithms. The glottal \ufb02ows obtained by inverse \ufb01ltering the speech signals are treated as ground truths. Since there is no ground truth for model parameters, we treat the parameters obtained by ADLES as ground truth. These results suggest that our forward-backward algorithm can effectively recover the vocal tract pro\ufb01le, glottal \ufb02ow, and model parameters. Table 2.

Validation 4 Our fourth validation comes indirectly from prior studies. Information from a dynam- ical systems perspective can give insights about the underlying mechanisms and principles that govern the vocal fold dynamics. Examples of features in this category are recurrence 18 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 analysis features, Lyapunov exponents, Hurst exponents, etc. These are mentioned in Appendix F. Some of these features have been used in real-world applications and proven to be effective. For example, in [39], the authors hypothesize that since COVID-19 impairs the respiratory system, effects on the phonation process could be expected, and signatures of COVID-19 could manifest in the vibration patterns of the vocal folds. In this paper, features have been derived from a signal processing perspective. This study used the ADLES method to estimate the asymmetric vocal folds model parameters. It further used the parameters and estimation residuals as features to other binary classi\ufb01ers such as logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and ran- dom forest, achieving around 0.8 ROC-AUC (area under the ROC curve) in discriminating positive COVID-19 cases from negative instances, on clinically collected and curated data. The data used contained recordings of extended vowel sounds from affected speakers and control subjects. The authors also discovered that COVID-19 positive individuals display different phase space behaviors from negative individuals: the phase space trajectories for negative individuals were found to be more regular and symmetric across the two vocal folds, while the trajectories for positive patients were more chaotic, implying a lack of synchronization and a higher degree of asymmetry in the vibrations of the left and right vocal folds. In a companion study, the authors in [40] used the ADLES-estimated glottal \ufb02ows as features to CNN-based two-step attention neural networks. The neural model detects differences in the estimated and actual glottal \ufb02ows and predicts two classes corresponding to COVID-19 positive and negative cases. This achieved 0.9 ROC-AUC (normalized) on clinically collected vowel sounds. Yet another study used higher order statistics derived from parameters, and Lyapunov and Hurst exponents derived from the phase space trajec- tories of the individualized asymmetric models, to detect Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) from voice with high accuracy (normalized ROC-AUC of 0.82 to 0.99) [41]. 6.
