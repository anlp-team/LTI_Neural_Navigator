The results show that a very high accuracy alignment was achieved for the walnut sample at a short time cost.

Conclusion for scanning tomography experiments, we In conclusion, present here automatic synchrotron tomographic alignment schemes based on genetic algorithms and human-in-the-loop software. These schemes are dedicated to addressing the needs to improve the sample alignment ef\ufb01ciency and automation in scanning tomography experiments and the necessary rotation- axis alignment prior to it. In terms of principle, our schemes divide each alignment job into two processes: coarse align- ment and \ufb01ne alignment. Coarse alignment is used for error correction on larger scales, while \ufb01ne alignment allows for high-precision adjustments. This ensures accuracy while signi\ufb01cantly reducing the time consumption on the overall process. Meanwhile, for the complex experimental conditions of scanning X-ray tomography, we have designed a GUI to supplement the algorithm, which provides sample detection, manual and sample monitoring functional modules as part of the coarse alignment work\ufb02ow.

Conclusion for scanning tomography experiments, we In conclusion, present here automatic synchrotron tomographic alignment schemes based on genetic algorithms and human-in-the-loop software. These schemes are dedicated to addressing the needs to improve the sample alignment ef\ufb01ciency and automation in scanning tomography experiments and the necessary rotation- axis alignment prior to it. In terms of principle, our schemes divide each alignment job into two processes: coarse align- ment and \ufb01ne alignment. Coarse alignment is used for error correction on larger scales, while \ufb01ne alignment allows for high-precision adjustments. This ensures accuracy while signi\ufb01cantly reducing the time consumption on the overall process. Meanwhile, for the complex experimental conditions of scanning X-ray tomography, we have designed a GUI to supplement the algorithm, which provides sample detection, manual and sample monitoring functional modules as part of the coarse alignment work\ufb02ow. Finally, the performance of our schemes was tested by virtual experi- ments; the misaligned rotation axis and sample were well adjustment References Amat, F., Moussavi, F., Comolli, L.
