Abstract Exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) in English Language Arts (ELA) with StoryQ is a 10-hour curriculum module designed for high school ELA classes. The module introduces students to fundamental AI concepts and essential machine learning workflow using StoryQ, a web- based GUI environment for Grades 6-12 learners. In this module, students work with unstructured text data and learn to train, test, and improve text classification models such as intent recognition, clickbait filter, and sentiment analysis. As they interact with machine-learning language models deeply, students also gain a nuanced understanding of language and how to wield it, not just as a data structure, but as a tool in our human-human encounters as well. The current version contains eight lessons, all delivered through a full-featured online learning and teaching platform. Computers and Internet access are required to implement the module. The module was piloted in an ELA class in the Spring of 2022, and the student learning outcomes were positive. The module is currently undergoing revision and will be further tested and improved in Fall 2022. Background1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming numerous industries and generating enormous wealth. However, the advancement in AI is reshaping the workforce, impacting people whose jobs can be replaced or redefined by AI systems. The wealth generated by AI advancement is unevenly distributed across different demographic groups, exacerbating existing inequities in society. Inequalities arising from current AI development are partially rooted in the unequal access to AI educational opportunities. K-12 is the critical stage for young people to develop foundational knowledge and interest in AI-related careers. At minimum, students need to understand that the current approach to AI development is based on machine learning (ML) from data and that data needs to be structured in ways such that machines can learn meaningful patterns (Touretzky et al., 2019). Ultimately, students should understand the roles and responsibilities of AI developers and potential pathways for their own participation in AI development. Integrating foundational AI education into disciplinary studies promises to transform AI education and reach students most underrepresented and underserved in the field. The key to this approach is to situate student learning in scenarios where disciplinary insights are critical for AI development, and AI applications give rise to new disciplinary practices. To bring this interdisciplinary learning vision to life, we have developed a 10-hour curriculum module, Exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) in English Language Arts (ELA) with StoryQ, for high school ELA classes.

Abstract Exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) in English Language Arts (ELA) with StoryQ is a 10-hour curriculum module designed for high school ELA classes. The module introduces students to fundamental AI concepts and essential machine learning workflow using StoryQ, a web- based GUI environment for Grades 6-12 learners. In this module, students work with unstructured text data and learn to train, test, and improve text classification models such as intent recognition, clickbait filter, and sentiment analysis. As they interact with machine-learning language models deeply, students also gain a nuanced understanding of language and how to wield it, not just as a data structure, but as a tool in our human-human encounters as well. The current version contains eight lessons, all delivered through a full-featured online learning and teaching platform. Computers and Internet access are required to implement the module. The module was piloted in an ELA class in the Spring of 2022, and the student learning outcomes were positive. The module is currently undergoing revision and will be further tested and improved in Fall 2022. Background1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming numerous industries and generating enormous wealth. However, the advancement in AI is reshaping the workforce, impacting people whose jobs can be replaced or redefined by AI systems. The wealth generated by AI advancement is unevenly distributed across different demographic groups, exacerbating existing inequities in society. Inequalities arising from current AI development are partially rooted in the unequal access to AI educational opportunities. K-12 is the critical stage for young people to develop foundational knowledge and interest in AI-related careers. At minimum, students need to understand that the current approach to AI development is based on machine learning (ML) from data and that data needs to be structured in ways such that machines can learn meaningful patterns (Touretzky et al., 2019). Ultimately, students should understand the roles and responsibilities of AI developers and potential pathways for their own participation in AI development. Integrating foundational AI education into disciplinary studies promises to transform AI education and reach students most underrepresented and underserved in the field. The key to this approach is to situate student learning in scenarios where disciplinary insights are critical for AI development, and AI applications give rise to new disciplinary practices.

Computer science (CS) courses, where AI content is considered a natural fit, are only offered in some U.S. high schools. They also have persistent diversity issues (Code.org et al., 2021), mainly because the focus of CS is typically on aspects that rely on advanced math rather than an interdisciplinary approach that would create opportunities for engagement among a more diverse student population. Furthermore, most CS courses do not include an AI unit. Only recently, research groups have started to develop and research AI teaching strategies at the K-12 level (e.g., Glazewski et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2021), and curriculum providers have developed AI content as an optional unit (e.g., Code.org n.d.). But AI education can extend beyond CS courses. AI is a highly interdisciplinary field. It builds on mathematical foundations and relies on disciplinary knowledge about the type of intelligence to simulate. Many AI innovations stem from the attempt to solve problems in subject domains outside CS. In the workplace, it is very common for non- CS professionals to learn and apply AI knowledge and skills and collaborate with computer scientists to solve problems in their domains. In the same way, AI education can happen in a variety of settings where the problems of interest call for AI solutions. Abstract Exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) in English Language Arts (ELA) with StoryQ is a 10-hour curriculum module designed for high school ELA classes. The module introduces students to fundamental AI concepts and essential machine learning workflow using StoryQ, a web- based GUI environment for Grades 6-12 learners. In this module, students work with unstructured text data and learn to train, test, and improve text classification models such as intent recognition, clickbait filter, and sentiment analysis. As they interact with machine-learning language models deeply, students also gain a nuanced understanding of language and how to wield it, not just as a data structure, but as a tool in our human-human encounters as well. The current version contains eight lessons, all delivered through a full-featured online learning and teaching platform. Computers and Internet access are required to implement the module. The module was piloted in an ELA class in the Spring of 2022, and the student learning outcomes were positive. The module is currently undergoing revision and will be further tested and improved in Fall 2022. Background1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming numerous industries and generating enormous wealth. However, the advancement in AI is reshaping the workforce, impacting people whose jobs can be replaced or redefined by AI systems. The wealth generated by AI advancement is unevenly distributed across different demographic groups, exacerbating existing inequities in society. Inequalities arising from current AI development are partially rooted in the unequal access to AI educational opportunities. K-12 is the critical stage for young people to develop foundational knowledge and interest in AI-related careers. At minimum, students need to understand that the current approach to AI development is based on machine learning (ML) from data and that data needs to be structured in ways such that machines can learn meaningful patterns (Touretzky et al., 2019). Ultimately, students should understand the roles and responsibilities of AI developers and potential pathways for their own participation in AI development. Integrating foundational AI education into disciplinary studies promises to transform AI education and reach students most underrepresented and underserved in the field. The key to this approach is to situate student learning in scenarios where disciplinary insights are critical for AI development, and AI applications give rise to new disciplinary practices. To bring this interdisciplinary learning vision to life, we have developed a 10-hour curriculum module, Exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) in English Language Arts (ELA) with StoryQ, for high school ELA classes. The module introduces students to fundamental AI concepts and essential machine learning workflow using StoryQ, a web- based GUI environment for Grades 6-12 learners.

The StoryQ app, a web-based machine learning and text mining tool that allows young learners (grades 6-12) to engage in machine learning practices and work with unstructured text data without coding. StoryQ features dynamically linked data representations that promote meaningful inquiries across tables, graphs, and texts\u2014a unique user experience that makes machine learning models transparent, explainable, and engaging. Students can use StoryQ to train, test, and troubleshoot text classification models using both standard feature extractors (e.g., N-grams) and special feature extraction tools and visualizations designed to support young learners and non- computing teachers. Below we showcase a few examples of how StoryQ supports the learning of ML concepts.
