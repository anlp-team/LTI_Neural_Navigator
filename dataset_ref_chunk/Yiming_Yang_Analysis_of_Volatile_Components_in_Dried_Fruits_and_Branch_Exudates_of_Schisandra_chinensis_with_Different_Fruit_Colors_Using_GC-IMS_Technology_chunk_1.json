Analysis of Volatile Components in Dried Fruits and Abstract: To investigate the volatile components of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Bail (commonly known as northern Schisandra) of different colors and to explore their similarities and differences, to identify the main \ufb02avor substances in the volatile components of the branch exudates of northern schisandra, and \ufb01nally to establish a \ufb01ngerprint map of the volatile components of the dried fruits and branch exudates of northern Schisandra of different colors, we used GC-IMS technology to analyze the volatile components of the dried fruits and branch exudates of three different colors of northern Schisandra and established a \ufb01ngerprint spectra. The results showed that a total of 60 different volatile chemical components were identi\ufb01ed in the branch exudates and dried fruits of Schisandra. The components of germplasm resources with different fruit colors were signi\ufb01cantly different. The ion mobility spectrum and OPLS-DA results showed that white and yellow fruits were more similar compared to red fruits. The volatile components in dried fruits were signi\ufb01cantly higher than those in branch exudates. After VIP (variable importance in projection) screening, 41 key volatile substances in dried fruits and 30 key volatile substances in branch exudates were obtained. After screening by odor activity value (OAV), there were 24 volatile components greater than 1 in both dried fruits and branch exudates. The most important contributing volatile substance was 3-methyl-butanal, and the most important contributing volatile substance in white fruit was (E)-2-hexenal.

The dried fruits of Schisandra chinensis contain about 20% volatile oil, which mainly consists of terpene compounds [9]. Gas chromatography\u2013ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) is a sensitive and rapid gas phase separation detection technology that has emerged in recent years. It combines ion mobility spectrometry with gas chromatography to generate a two-dimensional spectrum of volatile compounds. This is based on the retention characteristics of the gas chromatogra- phy column and the ion mobility rate of the ion mobility spectrometry detector, providing a more convenient, faster, and accurate method of analysis [10]. Furthermore, the sample does not require complex concentration and enrichment, which helps maintain the stability of \ufb02avor substances.

Bail (commonly known as northern Schisandra) of different colors and to explore their similarities and differences, to identify the main \ufb02avor substances in the volatile components of the branch exudates of northern schisandra, and \ufb01nally to establish a \ufb01ngerprint map of the volatile components of the dried fruits and branch exudates of northern Schisandra of different colors, we used GC-IMS technology to analyze the volatile components of the dried fruits and branch exudates of three different colors of northern Schisandra and established a \ufb01ngerprint spectra. The results showed that a total of 60 different volatile chemical components were identi\ufb01ed in the branch exudates and dried fruits of Schisandra. The components of germplasm resources with different fruit colors were signi\ufb01cantly different. The ion mobility spectrum and OPLS-DA results showed that white and yellow fruits were more similar compared to red fruits. The volatile components in dried fruits were signi\ufb01cantly higher than those in branch exudates. After VIP (variable importance in projection) screening, 41 key volatile substances in dried fruits and 30 key volatile substances in branch exudates were obtained. After screening by odor activity value (OAV), there were 24 volatile components greater than 1 in both dried fruits and branch exudates. The most important contributing volatile substance was 3-methyl-butanal, and the most important contributing volatile substance in white fruit was (E)-2-hexenal.

It combines ion mobility spectrometry with gas chromatography to generate a two-dimensional spectrum of volatile compounds. This is based on the retention characteristics of the gas chromatogra- phy column and the ion mobility rate of the ion mobility spectrometry detector, providing a more convenient, faster, and accurate method of analysis [10]. Furthermore, the sample does not require complex concentration and enrichment, which helps maintain the stability of \ufb02avor substances.

Baill. is a perennial woody vine of the Schisandra family mainly produced in eastern Russia, northeastern China, Korea, and other places. Its fruit is a traditional Chinese medicinal material, commonly known as \u201cNorthern Schisandra\u201d. Schisandra contains a variety of medicinal active ingredients, mainly including lignans, polysaccharides, volatile oils, triterpenes, organic acids, etc. [1]. The 2020 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia records 100 prescriptions related to Schisandra, which are usually used to treat various diseases, such as asthma and cardiovascular diseases [2,3]. The volatile oil of Schisandra can also improve cognitive dysfunction in mice [4]. The volatile chemical constituents of Schisandra, a signi\ufb01cant part of which is Schisandra essential oil, have been extensively studied for their pharmacological activity. Experimental validation has shown that Schisandra essential oil has anti-in\ufb02ammatory and neuroprotective effects [5].

Schisandra not only has a pleasant aroma but also has high potential pharmacological activity, making it of great research value in both culinary and medicinal applications. The dried fruits of Schisandra chinensis contain about 20% volatile oil, which mainly consists of terpene compounds [9]. Gas chromatography\u2013ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) is a sensitive and rapid gas phase separation detection technology that has emerged in recent years. It combines ion mobility spectrometry with gas chromatography to generate a two-dimensional spectrum of volatile compounds. This is based on the retention characteristics of the gas chromatogra- phy column and the ion mobility rate of the ion mobility spectrometry detector, providing a more convenient, faster, and accurate method of analysis [10]. Furthermore, the sample does not require complex concentration and enrichment, which helps maintain the stability of \ufb02avor substances. As such, GC-IMS can be widely used for distinguishing volatile compo- nents and isomers, analyzing trace components, and facilitating rapid on-site detection [11]. It is commonly used for odor detection in various \ufb01elds, such as food and environmental pollution, and is very suitable for the rapid detection of volatile components [12]. GC-IMS technology can be applied to the identi\ufb01cation of volatile organic compounds in traditional Chinese medicine materials, and the measurement results can be used as a reference for quality evaluation and variety selection. The University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ap- plied GC-IMS technology to measure the effect of different drying methods on the volatile oil components of wolfberry [13]; Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine used GC-IMS technology to study the \ufb01ngerprint of Asarum volatile oil and its chemical pattern recognition [14]; Zhejiang Institute of Food and Drug Inspection established a \ufb01ngerprint of volatile substances in Aurantium using GC-IMS technology and established a new method for identifying Aurantium [15]. Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine applied GC-IMS technology to measure the volatile oil components of Schisandra, and the results showed that the composition of Schisandra volatile components was complex, including terpenes, aromatics, aliphatics, and other compounds [6].

The results showed that a total of 60 different volatile chemical components were identi\ufb01ed in the branch exudates and dried fruits of Schisandra. The components of germplasm resources with different fruit colors were signi\ufb01cantly different. The ion mobility spectrum and OPLS-DA results showed that white and yellow fruits were more similar compared to red fruits. The volatile components in dried fruits were signi\ufb01cantly higher than those in branch exudates. After VIP (variable importance in projection) screening, 41 key volatile substances in dried fruits and 30 key volatile substances in branch exudates were obtained. After screening by odor activity value (OAV), there were 24 volatile components greater than 1 in both dried fruits and branch exudates. The most important contributing volatile substance was 3-methyl-butanal, and the most important contributing volatile substance in white fruit was (E)-2-hexenal.
