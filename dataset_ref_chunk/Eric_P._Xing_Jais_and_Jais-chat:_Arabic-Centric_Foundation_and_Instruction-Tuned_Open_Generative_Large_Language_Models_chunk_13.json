Existing Arabic benchmarks, however, do not include knowledge and commonsense evaluation, posing a challenge for the assessment of Jais. In contrast, in other languages, researchers have effectively used methods such as machine translation or the construction of datasets in a similar manner to assess the knowledge proficiency and the commonsense understanding of language models [Ope23, LKW+23]. In this context, as detailed in Section 5, we used a combination of techniques, including crafting analogous datasets to those available for English, using human translations and our in-house machine translation system to convert English datasets into Arabic for the purposes of evaluation. Evaluating only on knowledge [HBB+22, LZK+23] and commonsense reasoning [ZHB+19, SBBC21] based on the evaluation settings of prior work [TLI+23, MWS+23] is arguably not a holistic evaluation, as they are multiple-choice questions. To evaluate the generated text as a whole, human evaluation remains cru- cial. Unfortunately, it is both resource-intensive and sometimes exhibits variable quality, especially when using crowd-sourcing. Recent studies [T\u00a8or23, LXA23, GRS+23, WA23] have even suggested that ChatGPT anno- tation surpasses the performance of Amazon crowd-sourced workers, underscoring the importance of expert workers in the evaluation process. Expanding upon these findings, another study [PLH+23, CLL+23] used GPT-4 as a substitute for crowd-sourced workers to compare two model outputs. This is achieved by presenting an evaluation prompt and providing both model outputs as a context for the assessment. 8 Conclusion We have introduced Jais, a new state-of-the-art Arabic-English bilingual large language model (LLM), as well as its instruction-tuned variant, Jais-chat. The latter can perform a wide range of generative and downstream language tasks in both Arabic and English, ranging from common-sense reasoning to natural language un- derstanding tasks such as sentiment analysis, irony detection, and hate speech detection. Its pre-trained and fine-tuned capabilities outperform all known open-source Arabic models, and are comparable to state-of-the-art open-source English models that were trained on larger datasets. We encourage researchers, hobbyists, and enterprise developers alike to experiment with and to develop on top of our model, particularly those working on multi-lingual and/or non-English applications. Jais represents an important evolution and expansion of the NLP and AI landscape in the Middle East. This first-of-a-kind Arabic model born in the UAE represents an important strategic step for government and commercial organizations towards the digital revolution. By advancing Arabic language understanding and generation, empowering local players with sovereign and private deployment options, and nurturing a vibrant ecosystem of applications and innovation, this work supports a broader strategic initiative of digital and AI transformation to usher in an open, more linguistically-inclusive, and culturally-aware era. 9 Release Notes We release the models under Apache 2.0 license. Users of Jais must comply with the terms of the provided license, and applicable policies, laws, and regulations governing the specific use case and region. We encourage researchers, hobbyists, and enterprise developers alike to experiment with and to develop on top of the model \u2013 particularly those working on multi-lingual and/or non-English applications. 25 9.1 Intended Use This model is not only the first of its kind in the Arabic LLM ecosystem, but it also has been shown to be the best in the world among open Arabic or multilingual LLMs in terms of Arabic NLP capabilities. Some potential downstream uses are listed below: Research: This model can be used by researchers and developers to advance the Arabic LLM/NLP field. Commercial Use: It can be used as a foundational model to further fine-tune for specific usecases (like Jais-chat). Some potential usecases for businesses include (1) chat-assistants, (2) downstream tasks such as NLU/NLG, (3) customer service, and (4) process automation. We believe that a number of audiences will benefit from our model: Academics: those researching Arabic natural language processing. Businesses: companies targeting Arabic-speaking audiences. Developers: those integrating Arabic language capabilities in apps. 9.2 Out-of-Scope Use While Jais is a powerful Arabic and English bilingual model, it is essential to understand its limitations and the potential for its misuse. The following are some scenarios, but not limited to, where the model should not be used: Malicious Use: The model should not be used for generating harmful, misleading, or inappropriate content. This includes but is not limited to (i) generating or promoting hate speech, violence, or discrim- ination, (ii) spreading misinformation or fake news, (iii) engaging in illegal activities or promoting them, (i) (iv) handling sensitive information: the model should not be used to handle or to generate personal, confidential, or sensitive information. Generalization Across All Languages: Jais is bilingual and optimized for Arabic and English, and it should not be assumed to have equal proficiency in other languages or dialects. High-Stakes Decisions: The model should not be used for making high-stakes decisions without human oversight. This includes medical, legal, financial, or safety-critical decisions, among others. 9.3 Biases, Risks, and Limitations The model is trained on publicly available data which in part (Arabic) was curated by our preprocessing pipeline. We used different techniqes to reduce the bias that is inadvertently present in the dataset. While efforts were made to minimize biases, it is still possible that our model, like all LLM models, may exhibit some biases. The model is trained as an AI assistant for Arabic and English speakers, and thus it should be used to help humans to boost their productivity. In this context, it is limited to produce responses for queries in these two languages and it might not produce appropriate responses for queries in other languages. Potential misuses include generating harmful content, spreading misinformation, or handling sensitive in- formation. Users are urged to use the model responsibly and with discretion. 10 Acknowledgments We thank Arwa Abouelseoud and Ali Al Naqbi for their help with Arabic data annotation, evaluation, and contributions to improving the Arabic data processesing steps.

Evaluating only on knowledge [HBB+22, LZK+23] and commonsense reasoning [ZHB+19, SBBC21] based on the evaluation settings of prior work [TLI+23, MWS+23] is arguably not a holistic evaluation, as they are multiple-choice questions. To evaluate the generated text as a whole, human evaluation remains cru- cial. Unfortunately, it is both resource-intensive and sometimes exhibits variable quality, especially when using crowd-sourcing. Recent studies [T\u00a8or23, LXA23, GRS+23, WA23] have even suggested that ChatGPT anno- tation surpasses the performance of Amazon crowd-sourced workers, underscoring the importance of expert workers in the evaluation process. Expanding upon these findings, another study [PLH+23, CLL+23] used GPT-4 as a substitute for crowd-sourced workers to compare two model outputs. This is achieved by presenting an evaluation prompt and providing both model outputs as a context for the assessment. 8 Conclusion We have introduced Jais, a new state-of-the-art Arabic-English bilingual large language model (LLM), as well as its instruction-tuned variant, Jais-chat. The latter can perform a wide range of generative and downstream language tasks in both Arabic and English, ranging from common-sense reasoning to natural language un- derstanding tasks such as sentiment analysis, irony detection, and hate speech detection. Its pre-trained and fine-tuned capabilities outperform all known open-source Arabic models, and are comparable to state-of-the-art open-source English models that were trained on larger datasets. We encourage researchers, hobbyists, and enterprise developers alike to experiment with and to develop on top of our model, particularly those working on multi-lingual and/or non-English applications. Jais represents an important evolution and expansion of the NLP and AI landscape in the Middle East. This first-of-a-kind Arabic model born in the UAE represents an important strategic step for government and commercial organizations towards the digital revolution. By advancing Arabic language understanding and generation, empowering local players with sovereign and private deployment options, and nurturing a vibrant ecosystem of applications and innovation, this work supports a broader strategic initiative of digital and AI transformation to usher in an open, more linguistically-inclusive, and culturally-aware era. 9 Release Notes We release the models under Apache 2.0 license. Users of Jais must comply with the terms of the provided license, and applicable policies, laws, and regulations governing the specific use case and region. We encourage researchers, hobbyists, and enterprise developers alike to experiment with and to develop on top of the model \u2013 particularly those working on multi-lingual and/or non-English applications. 25 9.1 Intended Use This model is not only the first of its kind in the Arabic LLM ecosystem, but it also has been shown to be the best in the world among open Arabic or multilingual LLMs in terms of Arabic NLP capabilities. Some potential downstream uses are listed below: Research: This model can be used by researchers and developers to advance the Arabic LLM/NLP field. Commercial Use: It can be used as a foundational model to further fine-tune for specific usecases (like Jais-chat). Some potential usecases for businesses include (1) chat-assistants, (2) downstream tasks such as NLU/NLG, (3) customer service, and (4) process automation. We believe that a number of audiences will benefit from our model: Academics: those researching Arabic natural language processing. Businesses: companies targeting Arabic-speaking audiences. Developers: those integrating Arabic language capabilities in apps. 9.2 Out-of-Scope Use While Jais is a powerful Arabic and English bilingual model, it is essential to understand its limitations and the potential for its misuse. The following are some scenarios, but not limited to, where the model should not be used: Malicious Use: The model should not be used for generating harmful, misleading, or inappropriate content. This includes but is not limited to (i) generating or promoting hate speech, violence, or discrim- ination, (ii) spreading misinformation or fake news, (iii) engaging in illegal activities or promoting them, (i) (iv) handling sensitive information: the model should not be used to handle or to generate personal, confidential, or sensitive information. Generalization Across All Languages: Jais is bilingual and optimized for Arabic and English, and it should not be assumed to have equal proficiency in other languages or dialects. High-Stakes Decisions: The model should not be used for making high-stakes decisions without human oversight. This includes medical, legal, financial, or safety-critical decisions, among others. 9.3 Biases, Risks, and Limitations The model is trained on publicly available data which in part (Arabic) was curated by our preprocessing pipeline. We used different techniqes to reduce the bias that is inadvertently present in the dataset. While efforts were made to minimize biases, it is still possible that our model, like all LLM models, may exhibit some biases. The model is trained as an AI assistant for Arabic and English speakers, and thus it should be used to help humans to boost their productivity. In this context, it is limited to produce responses for queries in these two languages and it might not produce appropriate responses for queries in other languages. Potential misuses include generating harmful content, spreading misinformation, or handling sensitive in- formation. Users are urged to use the model responsibly and with discretion. 10 Acknowledgments We thank Arwa Abouelseoud and Ali Al Naqbi for their help with Arabic data annotation, evaluation, and contributions to improving the Arabic data processesing steps.

Its pre-trained and fine-tuned capabilities outperform all known open-source Arabic models, and are comparable to state-of-the-art open-source English models that were trained on larger datasets. We encourage researchers, hobbyists, and enterprise developers alike to experiment with and to develop on top of our model, particularly those working on multi-lingual and/or non-English applications. Jais represents an important evolution and expansion of the NLP and AI landscape in the Middle East. This first-of-a-kind Arabic model born in the UAE represents an important strategic step for government and commercial organizations towards the digital revolution. By advancing Arabic language understanding and generation, empowering local players with sovereign and private deployment options, and nurturing a vibrant ecosystem of applications and innovation, this work supports a broader strategic initiative of digital and AI transformation to usher in an open, more linguistically-inclusive, and culturally-aware era. 9 Release Notes We release the models under Apache 2.0 license. Users of Jais must comply with the terms of the provided license, and applicable policies, laws, and regulations governing the specific use case and region. We encourage researchers, hobbyists, and enterprise developers alike to experiment with and to develop on top of the model \u2013 particularly those working on multi-lingual and/or non-English applications. 25 9.1 Intended Use This model is not only the first of its kind in the Arabic LLM ecosystem, but it also has been shown to be the best in the world among open Arabic or multilingual LLMs in terms of Arabic NLP capabilities. Some potential downstream uses are listed below: Research: This model can be used by researchers and developers to advance the Arabic LLM/NLP field. Commercial Use: It can be used as a foundational model to further fine-tune for specific usecases (like Jais-chat). Some potential usecases for businesses include (1) chat-assistants, (2) downstream tasks such as NLU/NLG, (3) customer service, and (4) process automation. We believe that a number of audiences will benefit from our model: Academics: those researching Arabic natural language processing. Businesses: companies targeting Arabic-speaking audiences. Developers: those integrating Arabic language capabilities in apps. 9.2 Out-of-Scope Use While Jais is a powerful Arabic and English bilingual model, it is essential to understand its limitations and the potential for its misuse. The following are some scenarios, but not limited to, where the model should not be used: Malicious Use: The model should not be used for generating harmful, misleading, or inappropriate content. This includes but is not limited to (i) generating or promoting hate speech, violence, or discrim- ination, (ii) spreading misinformation or fake news, (iii) engaging in illegal activities or promoting them, (i) (iv) handling sensitive information: the model should not be used to handle or to generate personal, confidential, or sensitive information. Generalization Across All Languages: Jais is bilingual and optimized for Arabic and English, and it should not be assumed to have equal proficiency in other languages or dialects. High-Stakes Decisions: The model should not be used for making high-stakes decisions without human oversight. This includes medical, legal, financial, or safety-critical decisions, among others. 9.3 Biases, Risks, and Limitations The model is trained on publicly available data which in part (Arabic) was curated by our preprocessing pipeline. We used different techniqes to reduce the bias that is inadvertently present in the dataset. While efforts were made to minimize biases, it is still possible that our model, like all LLM models, may exhibit some biases. The model is trained as an AI assistant for Arabic and English speakers, and thus it should be used to help humans to boost their productivity. In this context, it is limited to produce responses for queries in these two languages and it might not produce appropriate responses for queries in other languages. Potential misuses include generating harmful content, spreading misinformation, or handling sensitive in- formation. Users are urged to use the model responsibly and with discretion. 10 Acknowledgments We thank Arwa Abouelseoud and Ali Al Naqbi for their help with Arabic data annotation, evaluation, and contributions to improving the Arabic data processesing steps.
