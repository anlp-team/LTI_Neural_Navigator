Therefore, a systematic assessment of both solar PV and wind energy under a carbon-neutral climate is needed to understand how they change from now and how they differ from other high-warming scenarios studies. Here, we present the first study, to our best knowledge, of quantifying solar PV and wind energy under deep mitigation scenarios, by leverag- ing a newly available large multi-model ensemble projection generated at the wake of the COVID-19 green recovery. To explore the potential impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 and post-pandemic green recovery, a new model intercomparison project (CovidMIP) was con- ducted by six Earth system model (ESM) modelling groups35. Assuming a fast renewable transition during the post-pandemic recovery, two emission scenarios reaching global carbon neutrality by 2050 and 2060 are designed in CovidMIP, which are contrasted with a well-studied weak mitigation scenario of SSP2-4.5, without reaching net zero before 2100. Our assessment of global solar PV and wind energy under the deep mitigation pathways, using a bias-corrected large ensemble of simulations with particular attention on the temporal intermittency of energy availability, will provide valuable support for decision-making in renewable energy investments across regions and sources. Changes in solar PV Solar PV is an important renewable supply to meet the ambitious climate change mitigation target. Here, we assess the solar PV potential (PVPOT) under different climate change scenarios (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The ensemble mean simulation projects that the solar PVPOT increases by ~4% in eastern China and ~3% in the eastern United States and west- ern Europe during 2040\u20132049 under SSP2-4.5 relative to the historical period (Fig. 1a). However, a large decline by approximately 4% is found over India, and also slight decrease but with high inter-model agreement over southern South America, central Asia, Australia, Africa and the western United States. Although this ensemble consists of four models, the spatial pattern of changes is consistent with other multi-model studies on SSP2-4.5 or higher-emission scenarios using the models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)36,37. The solar PVPOT in the mid-twenty-first century can be strongly influenced by global carbon-neutral policies (Fig. 1b,c). In eastern China, the increase in solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in SSP2-4.5 rela- tive to the historical period is projected to be further enhanced by another 2% and 3% in the moderate (MOD) and strong (STR) scenarios, respectively. In India and western Africa, the projected decrease in solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in SSP2-4.5 can be offset back to the historical level in the STR scenario (IND and WAF in Fig. 1d). In the eastern United States and western Europe, there is only weak enhancement of solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in the carbon-neutral scenarios compared with SSP2-4.5, but with high inter-model agreement (EUS and WEU in Fig. 1d). These results highlight a major co-benefit of carbon-neutral policies by enhancing solar PVPOT in the mid-twenty-first century over global land regions except for the Amazon, which is also clear when considering the resource quality of solar energy (Extended Data Fig. 1 showing absolute change).

Therefore, a systematic assessment of both solar PV and wind energy under a carbon-neutral climate is needed to understand how they change from now and how they differ from other high-warming scenarios studies. Here, we present the first study, to our best knowledge, of quantifying solar PV and wind energy under deep mitigation scenarios, by leverag- ing a newly available large multi-model ensemble projection generated at the wake of the COVID-19 green recovery. To explore the potential impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 and post-pandemic green recovery, a new model intercomparison project (CovidMIP) was con- ducted by six Earth system model (ESM) modelling groups35. Assuming a fast renewable transition during the post-pandemic recovery, two emission scenarios reaching global carbon neutrality by 2050 and 2060 are designed in CovidMIP, which are contrasted with a well-studied weak mitigation scenario of SSP2-4.5, without reaching net zero before 2100. Our assessment of global solar PV and wind energy under the deep mitigation pathways, using a bias-corrected large ensemble of simulations with particular attention on the temporal intermittency of energy availability, will provide valuable support for decision-making in renewable energy investments across regions and sources. Changes in solar PV Solar PV is an important renewable supply to meet the ambitious climate change mitigation target. Here, we assess the solar PV potential (PVPOT) under different climate change scenarios (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The ensemble mean simulation projects that the solar PVPOT increases by ~4% in eastern China and ~3% in the eastern United States and west- ern Europe during 2040\u20132049 under SSP2-4.5 relative to the historical period (Fig. 1a). However, a large decline by approximately 4% is found over India, and also slight decrease but with high inter-model agreement over southern South America, central Asia, Australia, Africa and the western United States. Although this ensemble consists of four models, the spatial pattern of changes is consistent with other multi-model studies on SSP2-4.5 or higher-emission scenarios using the models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)36,37. The solar PVPOT in the mid-twenty-first century can be strongly influenced by global carbon-neutral policies (Fig. 1b,c). In eastern China, the increase in solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in SSP2-4.5 rela- tive to the historical period is projected to be further enhanced by another 2% and 3% in the moderate (MOD) and strong (STR) scenarios, respectively. In India and western Africa, the projected decrease in solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in SSP2-4.5 can be offset back to the historical level in the STR scenario (IND and WAF in Fig. 1d). In the eastern United States and western Europe, there is only weak enhancement of solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in the carbon-neutral scenarios compared with SSP2-4.5, but with high inter-model agreement (EUS and WEU in Fig. 1d). These results highlight a major co-benefit of carbon-neutral policies by enhancing solar PVPOT in the mid-twenty-first century over global land regions except for the Amazon, which is also clear when considering the resource quality of solar energy (Extended Data Fig. 1 showing absolute change).

Therefore, a systematic assessment of both solar PV and wind energy under a carbon-neutral climate is needed to understand how they change from now and how they differ from other high-warming scenarios studies. Here, we present the first study, to our best knowledge, of quantifying solar PV and wind energy under deep mitigation scenarios, by leverag- ing a newly available large multi-model ensemble projection generated at the wake of the COVID-19 green recovery. To explore the potential impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 and post-pandemic green recovery, a new model intercomparison project (CovidMIP) was con- ducted by six Earth system model (ESM) modelling groups35. Assuming a fast renewable transition during the post-pandemic recovery, two emission scenarios reaching global carbon neutrality by 2050 and 2060 are designed in CovidMIP, which are contrasted with a well-studied weak mitigation scenario of SSP2-4.5, without reaching net zero before 2100. Our assessment of global solar PV and wind energy under the deep mitigation pathways, using a bias-corrected large ensemble of simulations with particular attention on the temporal intermittency of energy availability, will provide valuable support for decision-making in renewable energy investments across regions and sources. Changes in solar PV Solar PV is an important renewable supply to meet the ambitious climate change mitigation target. Here, we assess the solar PV potential (PVPOT) under different climate change scenarios (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The ensemble mean simulation projects that the solar PVPOT increases by ~4% in eastern China and ~3% in the eastern United States and west- ern Europe during 2040\u20132049 under SSP2-4.5 relative to the historical period (Fig. 1a). However, a large decline by approximately 4% is found over India, and also slight decrease but with high inter-model agreement over southern South America, central Asia, Australia, Africa and the western United States. Although this ensemble consists of four models, the spatial pattern of changes is consistent with other multi-model studies on SSP2-4.5 or higher-emission scenarios using the models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)36,37. The solar PVPOT in the mid-twenty-first century can be strongly influenced by global carbon-neutral policies (Fig. 1b,c). In eastern China, the increase in solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in SSP2-4.5 rela- tive to the historical period is projected to be further enhanced by another 2% and 3% in the moderate (MOD) and strong (STR) scenarios, respectively. In India and western Africa, the projected decrease in solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in SSP2-4.5 can be offset back to the historical level in the STR scenario (IND and WAF in Fig. 1d). In the eastern United States and western Europe, there is only weak enhancement of solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in the carbon-neutral scenarios compared with SSP2-4.5, but with high inter-model agreement (EUS and WEU in Fig. 1d). These results highlight a major co-benefit of carbon-neutral policies by enhancing solar PVPOT in the mid-twenty-first century over global land regions except for the Amazon, which is also clear when considering the resource quality of solar energy (Extended Data Fig. 1 showing absolute change).

Therefore, a systematic assessment of both solar PV and wind energy under a carbon-neutral climate is needed to understand how they change from now and how they differ from other high-warming scenarios studies. Here, we present the first study, to our best knowledge, of quantifying solar PV and wind energy under deep mitigation scenarios, by leverag- ing a newly available large multi-model ensemble projection generated at the wake of the COVID-19 green recovery. To explore the potential impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 and post-pandemic green recovery, a new model intercomparison project (CovidMIP) was con- ducted by six Earth system model (ESM) modelling groups35. Assuming a fast renewable transition during the post-pandemic recovery, two emission scenarios reaching global carbon neutrality by 2050 and 2060 are designed in CovidMIP, which are contrasted with a well-studied weak mitigation scenario of SSP2-4.5, without reaching net zero before 2100. Our assessment of global solar PV and wind energy under the deep mitigation pathways, using a bias-corrected large ensemble of simulations with particular attention on the temporal intermittency of energy availability, will provide valuable support for decision-making in renewable energy investments across regions and sources. Changes in solar PV Solar PV is an important renewable supply to meet the ambitious climate change mitigation target. Here, we assess the solar PV potential (PVPOT) under different climate change scenarios (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The ensemble mean simulation projects that the solar PVPOT increases by ~4% in eastern China and ~3% in the eastern United States and west- ern Europe during 2040\u20132049 under SSP2-4.5 relative to the historical period (Fig. 1a). However, a large decline by approximately 4% is found over India, and also slight decrease but with high inter-model agreement over southern South America, central Asia, Australia, Africa and the western United States. Although this ensemble consists of four models, the spatial pattern of changes is consistent with other multi-model studies on SSP2-4.5 or higher-emission scenarios using the models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)36,37. The solar PVPOT in the mid-twenty-first century can be strongly influenced by global carbon-neutral policies (Fig. 1b,c). In eastern China, the increase in solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in SSP2-4.5 rela- tive to the historical period is projected to be further enhanced by another 2% and 3% in the moderate (MOD) and strong (STR) scenarios, respectively. In India and western Africa, the projected decrease in solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in SSP2-4.5 can be offset back to the historical level in the STR scenario (IND and WAF in Fig. 1d). In the eastern United States and western Europe, there is only weak enhancement of solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in the carbon-neutral scenarios compared with SSP2-4.5, but with high inter-model agreement (EUS and WEU in Fig. 1d). These results highlight a major co-benefit of carbon-neutral policies by enhancing solar PVPOT in the mid-twenty-first century over global land regions except for the Amazon, which is also clear when considering the resource quality of solar energy (Extended Data Fig. 1 showing absolute change).
