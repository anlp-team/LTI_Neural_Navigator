Dashed line represents the 3.5 cut-off for data exclusion for inter-laboratory variation analysis. Data in grey indicates in-house assays, data in green indicates FLUCOP assays. lower %GCVs across the two B lineages; B Yamagata %GCV was signi\ufb01cantly lower using ether split antigen and conversely B Victoria %GCV was signi\ufb01cantly lower using native antigen. It remains unclear why in\ufb02uenza A viruses gave more consistent results than the in\ufb02uenza B viruses in this study. 3.3 MN data analysis 3.3.1 Intra-assay variability majority (95%) of samples have max-min ratios of \u22643.5, demonstrating good intra-laboratory reproducibility. Unlike the HAI, variability is fairly uniform across laboratories and subtype/ lineages with some small laboratory speci\ufb01c differences: Labs no.5 and 7 have higher intra-lab variation for H1N1"}
