We use the approach proposed in [31]\u2014we estimate the VFO model parameters to minimize the error between the volume velocity of air predicted by the model and a reference signal representing the actual glottal excitation to the vocal tract. If the VFO model were to be considered in isolation, this reference could be obtained through actual physical measurements, e.g., through photography [5], physical or numerical simulations [7,17], or by inverse \ufb01ltering the speech signal using a technique such as [35] (the approach used in [31]). For the purpose of our discussion in this section, however, we do not specify where this reference excitation is obtained from, since the estimation of VFO model parameters from a given glottal excitation is only a waypoint towards estimation from the joint model that includes both the VFO and VT components. As we will see in Section 4.2, this does not in fact require explicit knowledge of the reference signal at the glottis. Let ug(t) be the reference signal representing the true air-volume velocity at the glottis that excites the vocal tract. The volume velocity of air u0(t) (we remind the reader that u0(t) = u(0, t)) at the glottis can also be computed from the vocal fold opening at the glottis as u0(t) = \u02dccd(2\u03be0 + \u03bel(t) + \u03ber(t)) where \u03be0 is the half glottal width at rest, 2\u03be0 + \u03bel(t) + \u03ber(t) is the complete glottal opening, d is the length of the vocal fold, and \u02dcc is the air particle velocity at the midpoint of the vocal folds. We assume that the movement of the vocal folds follows the VFO model of Section 3.1. Correspondingly, \u03bel(t) and \u03ber(t) must obey Equation (3), subject to boundary conditions.

For the computation we set \u03be0 to a typical value of 0.1 cm. The length of the vocal folds d may be set to 17.5 mm (which is within the range of normal lengths for both male and female subjects), and the air particle velocity \u02dcc to 5000 cm/s [2].

We use the approach proposed in [31]\u2014we estimate the VFO model parameters to minimize the error between the volume velocity of air predicted by the model and a reference signal representing the actual glottal excitation to the vocal tract. If the VFO model were to be considered in isolation, this reference could be obtained through actual physical measurements, e.g., through photography [5], physical or numerical simulations [7,17], or by inverse \ufb01ltering the speech signal using a technique such as [35] (the approach used in [31]). For the purpose of our discussion in this section, however, we do not specify where this reference excitation is obtained from, since the estimation of VFO model parameters from a given glottal excitation is only a waypoint towards estimation from the joint model that includes both the VFO and VT components. As we will see in Section 4.2, this does not in fact require explicit knowledge of the reference signal at the glottis. Let ug(t) be the reference signal representing the true air-volume velocity at the glottis that excites the vocal tract. The volume velocity of air u0(t) (we remind the reader that u0(t) = u(0, t)) at the glottis can also be computed from the vocal fold opening at the glottis as u0(t) = \u02dccd(2\u03be0 + \u03bel(t) + \u03ber(t)) where \u03be0 is the half glottal width at rest, 2\u03be0 + \u03bel(t) + \u03ber(t) is the complete glottal opening, d is the length of the vocal fold, and \u02dcc is the air particle velocity at the midpoint of the vocal folds. We assume that the movement of the vocal folds follows the VFO model of Section 3.1. Correspondingly, \u03bel(t) and \u03ber(t) must obey Equation (3), subject to boundary conditions. The model parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u2206 can hence be computed to minimize the difference between the air volume velocity u0(t) predicted by the model and the reference ug We de\ufb01ne the instantaneous residual R as the error between u0(t) and ug(t): R(t) = u0(t) \u2212 ug(t) = \u02dccd(2\u03be0 + \u03bel(t) + \u03ber(t)) \u2212 ug(t) The overall (cid:96)2 error between u0(t) and ug(t) is given by the integral F(\u03bel, \u03ber; \u03d1) = (cid:90) T R2(t)dt 0 where \u03d1 = [\u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206] represents the parameters of the VFO model, and T represents the complete length of the reference signal. 8 of 39 (6) 0(t).

For the computation we set \u03be0 to a typical value of 0.1 cm. The length of the vocal folds d may be set to 17.5 mm (which is within the range of normal lengths for both male and female subjects), and the air particle velocity \u02dcc to 5000 cm/s [2].

Note that \u03bb and \u03b7 are also functions of time (we have not explicitly shown the \u201c(t)\u201d above for brevity of notation). We obtain the Lagrangian parameters \u03bb and \u03b7 as the solution to the following equa- tions: For 0 < t < T: \u00a8\u03bb + \u00a8\u03b7 + (cid:18) 2\u03b2\u03ber \u02d9\u03ber + 1 \u2212 (cid:18) 2\u03b2\u03bel \u02d9\u03bel + 1 + (cid:17) (cid:16) 1 + \u03be2 r (cid:16) \u03b2 (cid:17) 1 + \u03be2 l \u03b2 \u2206 2 \u2206 (cid:19) \u03bb + 2 \u02dccdR = 0 (cid:19) 2 \u03b7 + 2 \u02dccdR = 0 \u03bb \u2212 \u03b1(\u03bb + \u03b7) = 0 \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b1(\u03bb + \u03b7) = 0 9 of 39 (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 with initial conditions at t = T: \u03bb(T) = 0 \u02d9\u03bb(T) = 0 \u03b7(T) = 0 \u02d9\u03b7(T) = 0 Note that given \u03b1, \u03b2, \u2206, \u03ber and \u03bel, Equations (17)\u2013(24) represent a differential-algebraic system of equations and can be solved by any DAE solver to obtain \u03bb and \u03b7. Given \u03ber, \u03bel, \u03bb and \u03b7, the derivatives of F(\u03bel, \u03ber, \u03d1) w.r.t. \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u2206 can now be obtained as: F\u03b1 = F\u03b2 = F\u2206 = (cid:90) T 0 (cid:90) T 0 (cid:90) T 0 \u2212(cid:0) \u02d9\u03ber + \u02d9\u03bel (cid:17)"}
