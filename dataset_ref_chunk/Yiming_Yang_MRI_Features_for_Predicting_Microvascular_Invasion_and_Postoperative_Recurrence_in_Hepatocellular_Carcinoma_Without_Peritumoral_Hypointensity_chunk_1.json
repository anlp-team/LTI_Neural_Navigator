Patients and Methods: One hundred and thirty patients with HCC who underwent preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and curative hepatic resection were retrospectively reviewed. Two radiologists reviewed all preoperative MR images and assessed the radiological features of HCCs. The ability of peritumoral HBP hypointensity to identify MVI and intrahepatic recurrence was analyzed. We then assessed the MRI features of HCC that predicted the MVI and intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the subgroup without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Finally, a two-step flowchart was constructed to assist in clinical decision-making. Results: Peritumoral HBP hypointensity (odds ratio, 3.019; 95% confidence interval: 1.071\u20138.512; P=0.037) was an independent predictor of MVI. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and AUROC of peritumoral HBP hypointensity in predicting MVI were 23.80%, 91.04%, 71.23%, 55.96%, and 0.574, respectively. Intrahepatic RFS was significantly shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity (P<0.001). In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the only significant difference between MVI-positive and MVI-negative HCCs was the presence of a radiological capsule (P=0.038). Satellite nodule was an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS (hazard ratio,3.324; 95% CI: 1.733\u20136.378; P<0.001). The high-risk HCC detection rate was significantly higher when using the two-step flowchart that incorporated peritumoral HBP hypointensity and satellite nodule than when using peritumoral HBP hypointensity alone (P<0.001). Conclusion: In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, a radiological capsule is useful for identifying MVI and satellite nodule is an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS.

However, more than half of the patients treated with R0 resection will develop recurrence,4 which has a strong impact on prognosis. Microvascular invasion (MVI), defined as the presence of clusters of tumor cells in vessels located in the peritumoral area of the liver,5 is a major risk factor for HCC recurrence after surgery. However, MVI can only be detected by microscopic examination of the surgical specimen, which limits its application, particularly in terms of preoperative therapeutic decision-making and determination of resection margins during hepatectomy. Therefore, it is of great value to explore noninvasive methods that can determine MVI status preoperatively. Several noninvasive preoperative methods, including radiomics, deep learning, and gene expression signatures, have been used to predict MVI status and early tumor recurrence. Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MRI is widely used for the diagnosis and assessment of HCC. Assessment of tumor features on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI is easy to perform and does not require additional devices or expenses. Owing to the lack of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporter expression, most HCCs present hypointense signal compared to the surrounding liver parenchyma on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging. In MVI- positive patients, tumor cells in the vessels can result in dysfunction of the OATP transporter in hepatocytes located in the peritumoral liver parenchyma, leading to peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Although peritumoral HBP hypointensity has been identified as an important imaging feature with high specificity for predicting MVI, its sensitivity is relatively poor and was found to be only 44.2% in a recent meta-analysis.6,7 This finding indicates that more than half of patients with MVI do not show peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Given the importance of MVI in HCC management, it is imperative to identify complementary features that can predict MVI and tumor recurrence in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on this topic or its population. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the MRI features of HCC that predict MVI and postoperative recurrence in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity.

Patients and Methods: One hundred and thirty patients with HCC who underwent preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and curative hepatic resection were retrospectively reviewed. Two radiologists reviewed all preoperative MR images and assessed the radiological features of HCCs. The ability of peritumoral HBP hypointensity to identify MVI and intrahepatic recurrence was analyzed. We then assessed the MRI features of HCC that predicted the MVI and intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the subgroup without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Finally, a two-step flowchart was constructed to assist in clinical decision-making. Results: Peritumoral HBP hypointensity (odds ratio, 3.019; 95% confidence interval: 1.071\u20138.512; P=0.037) was an independent predictor of MVI. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and AUROC of peritumoral HBP hypointensity in predicting MVI were 23.80%, 91.04%, 71.23%, 55.96%, and 0.574, respectively. Intrahepatic RFS was significantly shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity (P<0.001). In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the only significant difference between MVI-positive and MVI-negative HCCs was the presence of a radiological capsule (P=0.038). Satellite nodule was an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS (hazard ratio,3.324; 95% CI: 1.733\u20136.378; P<0.001). The high-risk HCC detection rate was significantly higher when using the two-step flowchart that incorporated peritumoral HBP hypointensity and satellite nodule than when using peritumoral HBP hypointensity alone (P<0.001). Conclusion: In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, a radiological capsule is useful for identifying MVI and satellite nodule is an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS.

However, more than half of the patients treated with R0 resection will develop recurrence,4 which has a strong impact on prognosis. Microvascular invasion (MVI), defined as the presence of clusters of tumor cells in vessels located in the peritumoral area of the liver,5 is a major risk factor for HCC recurrence after surgery. However, MVI can only be detected by microscopic examination of the surgical specimen, which limits its application, particularly in terms of preoperative therapeutic decision-making and determination of resection margins during hepatectomy. Therefore, it is of great value to explore noninvasive methods that can determine MVI status preoperatively. Several noninvasive preoperative methods, including radiomics, deep learning, and gene expression signatures, have been used to predict MVI status and early tumor recurrence. Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MRI is widely used for the diagnosis and assessment of HCC. Assessment of tumor features on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI is easy to perform and does not require additional devices or expenses. Owing to the lack of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporter expression, most HCCs present hypointense signal compared to the surrounding liver parenchyma on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging. In MVI- positive patients, tumor cells in the vessels can result in dysfunction of the OATP transporter in hepatocytes located in the peritumoral liver parenchyma, leading to peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Although peritumoral HBP hypointensity has been identified as an important imaging feature with high specificity for predicting MVI, its sensitivity is relatively poor and was found to be only 44.2% in a recent meta-analysis.6,7 This finding indicates that more than half of patients with MVI do not show peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Given the importance of MVI in HCC management, it is imperative to identify complementary features that can predict MVI and tumor recurrence in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on this topic or its population.

Patients and Methods: One hundred and thirty patients with HCC who underwent preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and curative hepatic resection were retrospectively reviewed. Two radiologists reviewed all preoperative MR images and assessed the radiological features of HCCs. The ability of peritumoral HBP hypointensity to identify MVI and intrahepatic recurrence was analyzed. We then assessed the MRI features of HCC that predicted the MVI and intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the subgroup without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Finally, a two-step flowchart was constructed to assist in clinical decision-making. Results: Peritumoral HBP hypointensity (odds ratio, 3.019; 95% confidence interval: 1.071\u20138.512; P=0.037) was an independent predictor of MVI. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and AUROC of peritumoral HBP hypointensity in predicting MVI were 23.80%, 91.04%, 71.23%, 55.96%, and 0.574, respectively. Intrahepatic RFS was significantly shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity (P<0.001). In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the only significant difference between MVI-positive and MVI-negative HCCs was the presence of a radiological capsule (P=0.038). Satellite nodule was an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS (hazard ratio,3.324; 95% CI: 1.733\u20136.378; P<0.001). The high-risk HCC detection rate was significantly higher when using the two-step flowchart that incorporated peritumoral HBP hypointensity and satellite nodule than when using peritumoral HBP hypointensity alone (P<0.001). Conclusion: In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, a radiological capsule is useful for identifying MVI and satellite nodule is an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS.

However, more than half of the patients treated with R0 resection will develop recurrence,4 which has a strong impact on prognosis. Microvascular invasion (MVI), defined as the presence of clusters of tumor cells in vessels located in the peritumoral area of the liver,5 is a major risk factor for HCC recurrence after surgery. However, MVI can only be detected by microscopic examination of the surgical specimen, which limits its application, particularly in terms of preoperative therapeutic decision-making and determination of resection margins during hepatectomy. Therefore, it is of great value to explore noninvasive methods that can determine MVI status preoperatively. Several noninvasive preoperative methods, including radiomics, deep learning, and gene expression signatures, have been used to predict MVI status and early tumor recurrence. Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MRI is widely used for the diagnosis and assessment of HCC. Assessment of tumor features on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI is easy to perform and does not require additional devices or expenses. Owing to the lack of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporter expression, most HCCs present hypointense signal compared to the surrounding liver parenchyma on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging. In MVI- positive patients, tumor cells in the vessels can result in dysfunction of the OATP transporter in hepatocytes located in the peritumoral liver parenchyma, leading to peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Although peritumoral HBP hypointensity has been identified as an important imaging feature with high specificity for predicting MVI, its sensitivity is relatively poor and was found to be only 44.2% in a recent meta-analysis.6,7 This finding indicates that more than half of patients with MVI do not show peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Given the importance of MVI in HCC management, it is imperative to identify complementary features that can predict MVI and tumor recurrence in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on this topic or its population. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the MRI features of HCC that predict MVI and postoperative recurrence in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity.
