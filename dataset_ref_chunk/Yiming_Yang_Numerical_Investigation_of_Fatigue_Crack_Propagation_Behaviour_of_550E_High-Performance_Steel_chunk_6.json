Initial Crack Angle To study the e\ufb00ect of the initial crack angle on the crack propagation, initial cracks at four angles of 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0 were prefabricated on the specimens in this study. The initial crack length was 1.5 mm with a 7 kN load level, thickness of 8 mm, and stress ratio of 0.1. As shown in Figure 11, the trends of crack propagation at di\ufb00erent angles were the same. The curves are very close to each other when the initial angles are in the range of 0\u00b0\u201345\u00b0, but they change signi\ufb01cantly at 60\u00b0. Thus, there is a critical angle of crack propa-gation. An encrypted approximation at 45\u00b0\u201360\u00b0 was carried out. It was found that the crit-ical angle was 52.5\u00b0, where the crack growth rate suddenly changed. According to the K\u2013N curve, with an increase in the initial crack propagation angle, the stress intensity factor caused by crack tip fracture decreases, and the reduction range is as high as 59%. There-fore, an initial crack angle of 0\u00b0 is the most unfavourable for crack propagation. The initial crack angle has little e\ufb00ect on the K\u2013a relationship.

The initial crack length was 1.5 mm with a 7 kN load level, thickness of 8 mm, and stress ratio of 0.1. As shown in Figure 11, the trends of crack propagation at di\ufb00erent angles were the same. The curves are very close to each other when the initial angles are in the range of 0\u00b0\u201345\u00b0, but they change signi\ufb01cantly at 60\u00b0. Thus, there is a critical angle of crack propa-gation. An encrypted approximation at 45\u00b0\u201360\u00b0 was carried out. It was found that the crit-ical angle was 52.5\u00b0, where the crack growth rate suddenly changed. According to the K\u2013N curve, with an increase in the initial crack propagation angle, the stress intensity factor caused by crack tip fracture decreases, and the reduction range is as high as 59%. There-fore, an initial crack angle of 0\u00b0 is the most unfavourable for crack propagation. The initial crack angle has little e\ufb00ect on the K\u2013a relationship.

Initial Crack Angle To study the e\ufb00ect of the initial crack angle on the crack propagation, initial cracks at four angles of 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0 were prefabricated on the specimens in this study. The initial crack length was 1.5 mm with a 7 kN load level, thickness of 8 mm, and stress ratio of 0.1. As shown in Figure 11, the trends of crack propagation at di\ufb00erent angles were the same. The curves are very close to each other when the initial angles are in the range of 0\u00b0\u201345\u00b0, but they change signi\ufb01cantly at 60\u00b0. Thus, there is a critical angle of crack propa-gation. An encrypted approximation at 45\u00b0\u201360\u00b0 was carried out. It was found that the crit-ical angle was 52.5\u00b0, where the crack growth rate suddenly changed. According to the K\u2013N curve, with an increase in the initial crack propagation angle, the stress intensity factor caused by crack tip fracture decreases, and the reduction range is as high as 59%. There-fore, an initial crack angle of 0\u00b0 is the most unfavourable for crack propagation. The initial crack angle has little e\ufb00ect on the K\u2013a relationship.
