However, community-speci\ufb01c investigations are an important future step towards developing effective counter-statements. Accuracy of generated exceptions The selec- tion of speci\ufb01c individuals for direct exceptions presents an ongoing challenge, based on the high number of DIR-IND marked incorrect. Since lan- guage models often encode biases and stereotypes derived from training corpora (Sheng et al., 2019), they may have dif\ufb01culty producing relevant individ- uals who are not prototypical (i.e., they do not have a particular stereotype). We illustrate incorrect indi- viduals and subgroups in the bottom two examples of Table 1. Additionally, as mentioned in \u00a74, many stereotypes are subjective (e.g., \u201cwomen are vain\u201d). Therefore, individuals who are counterexamples to the stereotype may be judged differently by differ- ent people (e.g., our system proposes that \u201ctaylor swift, sarah palin, and scarlett johansson\u201d are not vain). Producing accurate and relevant direct excep- tions to a stereotype is important for understanding the role of such examples to counter essentialist beliefs. Our results and discussion highlight the complex- ity of countering essentialist beliefs. We propose that future work should improve the factuality of counterstatements, particularly of direct counter- evidence, and consider both variation in respon- dent demographics and community-speci\ufb01c needs. Therefore, we argue that working at the intersec- tion of NLP and psychology is crucial for further investigations in this area. 6 Societal and Ethical Considerations Annotation Considerations Prior work has highlighted the potential harms to workers who are subjected to offensive statements (Roberts, 2017; Steiger et al., 2021). To mitigate these, we en- courage annotators to reach out to the authors with concerns and questions or to the Crisis Text Line.2 Additionally, our study design was approved by our ethics review board (IRB) and workers earned a median wage of $10/h. Risks of Generation Since our system automat- ically generates counterstatements, there is poten- tial for misuse in several ways. First, our system can automatically and quickly produce millions of counterstatements could therefore be used in a distributed-denial-of-service attack. Second, by generating counterstatements to stereotypes in text the original text remains available and so it may still cause harm (Ullmann and Tomalin, 2019) and perpetuate essentialist beliefs. Additionally, the au- tomatic construction of counterstatements has the potential to produce false statements and further harmful generalizations (e.g., generalize a harmful stereotype to another marginalized group). Consid- ering these factors, it is important to jointly develop regulation alongside AI technology to limit harms and misuse in deployment (Crawford, 2021; Reich et al., 2021). 2https://www.crisistextline.org/ Acknowledgements We would like to thank the Beaker Team at AI2 for the compute infrastructure, and the anonymous reviewers for their suggestions.

However, community-speci\ufb01c investigations are an important future step towards developing effective counter-statements. Accuracy of generated exceptions The selec- tion of speci\ufb01c individuals for direct exceptions presents an ongoing challenge, based on the high number of DIR-IND marked incorrect. Since lan- guage models often encode biases and stereotypes derived from training corpora (Sheng et al., 2019), they may have dif\ufb01culty producing relevant individ- uals who are not prototypical (i.e., they do not have a particular stereotype). We illustrate incorrect indi- viduals and subgroups in the bottom two examples of Table 1. Additionally, as mentioned in \u00a74, many stereotypes are subjective (e.g., \u201cwomen are vain\u201d). Therefore, individuals who are counterexamples to the stereotype may be judged differently by differ- ent people (e.g., our system proposes that \u201ctaylor swift, sarah palin, and scarlett johansson\u201d are not vain). Producing accurate and relevant direct excep- tions to a stereotype is important for understanding the role of such examples to counter essentialist beliefs. Our results and discussion highlight the complex- ity of countering essentialist beliefs. We propose that future work should improve the factuality of counterstatements, particularly of direct counter- evidence, and consider both variation in respon- dent demographics and community-speci\ufb01c needs.

To mitigate these, we en- courage annotators to reach out to the authors with concerns and questions or to the Crisis Text Line.2 Additionally, our study design was approved by our ethics review board (IRB) and workers earned a median wage of $10/h. Risks of Generation Since our system automat- ically generates counterstatements, there is poten- tial for misuse in several ways. First, our system can automatically and quickly produce millions of counterstatements could therefore be used in a distributed-denial-of-service attack. Second, by generating counterstatements to stereotypes in text the original text remains available and so it may still cause harm (Ullmann and Tomalin, 2019) and perpetuate essentialist beliefs. Additionally, the au- tomatic construction of counterstatements has the potential to produce false statements and further harmful generalizations (e.g., generalize a harmful stereotype to another marginalized group). Consid- ering these factors, it is important to jointly develop regulation alongside AI technology to limit harms and misuse in deployment (Crawford, 2021; Reich et al., 2021). 2https://www.crisistextline.org/ Acknowledgements We would like to thank the Beaker Team at AI2 for the compute infrastructure, and the anonymous reviewers for their suggestions.

However, community-speci\ufb01c investigations are an important future step towards developing effective counter-statements. Accuracy of generated exceptions The selec- tion of speci\ufb01c individuals for direct exceptions presents an ongoing challenge, based on the high number of DIR-IND marked incorrect. Since lan- guage models often encode biases and stereotypes derived from training corpora (Sheng et al., 2019), they may have dif\ufb01culty producing relevant individ- uals who are not prototypical (i.e., they do not have a particular stereotype). We illustrate incorrect indi- viduals and subgroups in the bottom two examples of Table 1. Additionally, as mentioned in \u00a74, many stereotypes are subjective (e.g., \u201cwomen are vain\u201d). Therefore, individuals who are counterexamples to the stereotype may be judged differently by differ- ent people (e.g., our system proposes that \u201ctaylor swift, sarah palin, and scarlett johansson\u201d are not vain). Producing accurate and relevant direct excep- tions to a stereotype is important for understanding the role of such examples to counter essentialist beliefs. Our results and discussion highlight the complex- ity of countering essentialist beliefs. We propose that future work should improve the factuality of counterstatements, particularly of direct counter- evidence, and consider both variation in respon- dent demographics and community-speci\ufb01c needs. Therefore, we argue that working at the intersec- tion of NLP and psychology is crucial for further investigations in this area. 6 Societal and Ethical Considerations Annotation Considerations Prior work has highlighted the potential harms to workers who are subjected to offensive statements (Roberts, 2017; Steiger et al., 2021). To mitigate these, we en- courage annotators to reach out to the authors with concerns and questions or to the Crisis Text Line.2 Additionally, our study design was approved by our ethics review board (IRB) and workers earned a median wage of $10/h. Risks of Generation Since our system automat- ically generates counterstatements, there is poten- tial for misuse in several ways. First, our system can automatically and quickly produce millions of counterstatements could therefore be used in a distributed-denial-of-service attack. Second, by generating counterstatements to stereotypes in text the original text remains available and so it may still cause harm (Ullmann and Tomalin, 2019) and perpetuate essentialist beliefs. Additionally, the au- tomatic construction of counterstatements has the potential to produce false statements and further harmful generalizations (e.g., generalize a harmful stereotype to another marginalized group). Consid- ering these factors, it is important to jointly develop regulation alongside AI technology to limit harms and misuse in deployment (Crawford, 2021; Reich et al., 2021). 2https://www.crisistextline.org/ Acknowledgements We would like to thank the Beaker Team at AI2 for the compute infrastructure, and the anonymous reviewers for their suggestions.
