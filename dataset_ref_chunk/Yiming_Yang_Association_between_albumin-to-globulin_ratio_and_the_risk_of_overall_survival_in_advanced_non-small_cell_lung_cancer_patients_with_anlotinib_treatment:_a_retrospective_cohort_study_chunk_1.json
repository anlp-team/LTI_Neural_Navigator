We aimed to investigate the relationship between AGR and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anlotinib. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 196 advanced NSCLC patients with anlotinib treatment between June 1, 2018 and June 1, 2021. The exposure was AGR, calculated by baseline serum albumin / (serum total protein - serum albumin). The outcome was OS, defined as the period from the date of initial treatment with anlotinib to death or the last follow-up. The univariate and multivariate linear regression models and generalized additive models (GAM) were used to analyze the relationship between AGR and OS. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the OS. Results After adjusting for potential confounders, a non-linear relationship was observed between AGR and OS, which had an inflection point of 1.24. The hazard ratio and the confidence intervals on the left and the right sides of the inflection point were 13.05 (0.52 to 327.64) and 0.20 (0.07 to 0.57), respectively. It suggested that AGR was positively associated with OS when AGR was larger than 1.24, for every 1 unit increase in AGR, the risk of death lowered approximately by 80%. \u2020Jinzhan Chen, Congyi Xie and Yimin Yang contributed equally to this work.

Page 2 of 10 Conclusions The relationship between AGR and the OS for advanced NSCLC patients with anlotinib is non-linear. AGR level is an independent protective factor for OS in advanced NSCLC patients who received anlotinib therapy. Keywords Lung cancer, Anlotinib, Albumin, Globulin, Overall survival Introduction Recently, the epidemiological survey released that lung cancer is still the most diagnosed type of cancer, account- ing for 20% of global cancer-related mortality [1, 2]. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major type of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all primary lung cancers [3]. At present, in addition to the traditional treatment methods, the rapid development of targeted therapy and immunotherapy has significantly improved the survival of lung cancer patients. The appli- cation of antiangiogenic drugs in lung cancer patients\u2019 treatment is considered to have good therapeutic effects. Anlotinib is a selective receptor tyrosine kinase inhibi- tor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor recep- tors, fibroblast growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1 and c-Kit [4]. Based on the overall survival benefit observed in a randomized, dou- ble-blind, multicenter, phase III trial (ALTER0303) [5], the China National Medical Products Administra- tion approved anlotinib for the treatment of third-line advanced NSCLC. However, not all patients will benefit from anlotinib, thus, it is particularly of utmost impor- tance to find prognostic biomarkers, which are simple, inexpensive and affordable, to select suitable patients. Albumin and globulin have attracted wide attention as non-invasive prognostic factors of tumors. Albumin can be used to reflect the nutritional and systemic inflam- matory status of cancer patients and can be used as a prognostic marker for diverse cancers [6\u201310]. Globulin, as one of the main cortisol-binding proteins, can partici- pate in immune and inflammatory responses [11]. As a combination of albumin and globulin, the albumin-to- globulin ratio (AGR) reflects both nutritional status and inflammatory response [12], which has been reported to be associated with the prognosis of several cancers [10, 13\u201316].We suggest that AGR is a credible predic- tive parameter for several reasons. Firstly, a lower AGR level can be attributed to reduced albumin levels and/or elevated globulin levels, encompassing both significant unfavorable predictors and potentially enhancing the accuracy of predictions compared to individual param- eters. Secondly, the advantage of AGR lies in its relative insensitivity to conditions such as dehydration and fluid retention, which can cause fluctuations in albumin and globulin levels. However, so far, there is no study that have reported the relationship between AGR and overall survival (OS) of advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib. Therefore, we retrospectively studied the rela- tionship between AGR and OS with the hypothesis that AGR level can be an independent protective factor for OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib. Methods Study design and population To explore the relationship between AGR and OS in patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC and treated with anlotinib, we conducted a retrospective cohort study. All patients included in this study were admitted to the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medi- cine of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University between June 1, 2018 and June 1, 2021.

As a combination of albumin and globulin, the albumin-to- globulin ratio (AGR) reflects both nutritional status and inflammatory response [12], which has been reported to be associated with the prognosis of several cancers [10, 13\u201316].We suggest that AGR is a credible predic- tive parameter for several reasons. Firstly, a lower AGR level can be attributed to reduced albumin levels and/or elevated globulin levels, encompassing both significant unfavorable predictors and potentially enhancing the accuracy of predictions compared to individual param- eters. Secondly, the advantage of AGR lies in its relative insensitivity to conditions such as dehydration and fluid retention, which can cause fluctuations in albumin and globulin levels. However, so far, there is no study that have reported the relationship between AGR and overall survival (OS) of advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib. Therefore, we retrospectively studied the rela- tionship between AGR and OS with the hypothesis that AGR level can be an independent protective factor for OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib. Methods Study design and population To explore the relationship between AGR and OS in patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC and treated with anlotinib, we conducted a retrospective cohort study.

Keywords Lung cancer, Anlotinib, Albumin, Globulin, Overall survival Introduction Recently, the epidemiological survey released that lung cancer is still the most diagnosed type of cancer, account- ing for 20% of global cancer-related mortality [1, 2]. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major type of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all primary lung cancers [3]. At present, in addition to the traditional treatment methods, the rapid development of targeted therapy and immunotherapy has significantly improved the survival of lung cancer patients. The appli- cation of antiangiogenic drugs in lung cancer patients\u2019 treatment is considered to have good therapeutic effects. Anlotinib is a selective receptor tyrosine kinase inhibi- tor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor recep- tors, fibroblast growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1 and c-Kit [4]. Based on the overall survival benefit observed in a randomized, dou- ble-blind, multicenter, phase III trial (ALTER0303) [5], the China National Medical Products Administra- tion approved anlotinib for the treatment of third-line advanced NSCLC. However, not all patients will benefit from anlotinib, thus, it is particularly of utmost impor- tance to find prognostic biomarkers, which are simple, inexpensive and affordable, to select suitable patients.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major type of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all primary lung cancers [3]. At present, in addition to the traditional treatment methods, the rapid development of targeted therapy and immunotherapy has significantly improved the survival of lung cancer patients. The appli- cation of antiangiogenic drugs in lung cancer patients\u2019 treatment is considered to have good therapeutic effects. Anlotinib is a selective receptor tyrosine kinase inhibi- tor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor recep- tors, fibroblast growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1 and c-Kit [4]. Based on the overall survival benefit observed in a randomized, dou- ble-blind, multicenter, phase III trial (ALTER0303) [5], the China National Medical Products Administra- tion approved anlotinib for the treatment of third-line advanced NSCLC. However, not all patients will benefit from anlotinib, thus, it is particularly of utmost impor- tance to find prognostic biomarkers, which are simple, inexpensive and affordable, to select suitable patients. Albumin and globulin have attracted wide attention as non-invasive prognostic factors of tumors. Albumin can be used to reflect the nutritional and systemic inflam- matory status of cancer patients and can be used as a prognostic marker for diverse cancers [6\u201310]. Globulin, as one of the main cortisol-binding proteins, can partici- pate in immune and inflammatory responses [11]. As a combination of albumin and globulin, the albumin-to- globulin ratio (AGR) reflects both nutritional status and inflammatory response [12], which has been reported to be associated with the prognosis of several cancers [10, 13\u201316].We suggest that AGR is a credible predic- tive parameter for several reasons. Firstly, a lower AGR level can be attributed to reduced albumin levels and/or elevated globulin levels, encompassing both significant unfavorable predictors and potentially enhancing the accuracy of predictions compared to individual param- eters. Secondly, the advantage of AGR lies in its relative insensitivity to conditions such as dehydration and fluid retention, which can cause fluctuations in albumin and globulin levels. However, so far, there is no study that have reported the relationship between AGR and overall survival (OS) of advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib. Therefore, we retrospectively studied the rela- tionship between AGR and OS with the hypothesis that AGR level can be an independent protective factor for OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib. Methods Study design and population To explore the relationship between AGR and OS in patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC and treated with anlotinib, we conducted a retrospective cohort study. All patients included in this study were admitted to the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medi- cine of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University between June 1, 2018 and June 1, 2021.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between AGR and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anlotinib. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 196 advanced NSCLC patients with anlotinib treatment between June 1, 2018 and June 1, 2021. The exposure was AGR, calculated by baseline serum albumin / (serum total protein - serum albumin). The outcome was OS, defined as the period from the date of initial treatment with anlotinib to death or the last follow-up. The univariate and multivariate linear regression models and generalized additive models (GAM) were used to analyze the relationship between AGR and OS. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the OS. Results After adjusting for potential confounders, a non-linear relationship was observed between AGR and OS, which had an inflection point of 1.24. The hazard ratio and the confidence intervals on the left and the right sides of the inflection point were 13.05 (0.52 to 327.64) and 0.20 (0.07 to 0.57), respectively. It suggested that AGR was positively associated with OS when AGR was larger than 1.24, for every 1 unit increase in AGR, the risk of death lowered approximately by 80%. \u2020Jinzhan Chen, Congyi Xie and Yimin Yang contributed equally to this work.
