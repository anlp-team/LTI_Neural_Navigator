From a medical/surgical perspective, satisfaction with the transplant is a broad and vital area for assessment. Based on our stakeholder input and experience with PRO development, we chose to divide the topic of physical HRQOL after UE transplant into three areas: Function, Sensation, and Aesthetics. Frontiers in Psychology 07 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.989593 Functional abilities of the transplanted limb can be evaluated similarly to any surgical population, considering, for example, range of motion, grip strength, pain, and the various activities of daily living that require manual motor function and dexterity to complete. Thus, we believe that assessment of functional ability is best left to existing measures, such as SCI-FI Fine Motor, SCI-FI Self-Care, PROMIS Upper Extremity (Jette et al., 2012; Tulsky et al., 2012; Kaat et al., 2019), or Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity- Fine Motor (Cella et al., 2012; Gershon et al., 2012). In contrast, satisfaction with hand functioning as experienced by UE transplant recipients appears to merit a new HRQOL content domain, as difficulties and frustrations with the responsivity and ease of movement of the transplanted limbs/hands are distinct for this population, where capabilities improve gradually with treatment and nerve regrowth\u2014or sometimes not at all. Likewise, the challenges with sensation and aesthetic satisfaction are also unique to UE transplant. Although there are other clinical groups (e.g., spinal cord injury) where UE sensation can be impacted by injury, and the process of developing sensory-motor control for advanced prosthetic limb users has some similarities (Graczyk et al., 2019; Sensinger and Dosen, 2020), the experience of regaining sensory capabilities as donor nerves become reinnervated is distinct in limb transplant. There are similarities for UE transplant recipients to the benefits experienced from targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) in terms of reduced phantom limb pain and neuroma- related pain (Morgan et al., 2016; Tintle et al., 2016; Dumanian et al., 2019), and similarities with both invasive (e.g., targeted sensory reinnervation) and non-invasive (e.g., armband-based stimulators) technologies for restoring sensory input with prosthetic or bionic devices (Bensmaia et al., 2020), although ideally the outcome of the VCA transplant will go further than any one of these approaches and restore more natural motor control and sensation to the injured limb. Furthermore, the aesthetic and cosmetic aspects are of central concern for many patients (e.g., concerns about mismatched skin tone, body hair color/texture, and musculature/ size/bulk of transplanted limb). These issues are layered upon the body image concerns experienced by UE amputees and involve the singular experience of aesthetically integrating donor tissue in a highly visible body location (whereas most solid-organ transplants occur with internal/non-visible tissue). Hence, we have chosen to develop outcomes measures in the physical HRQOL area, including Hand Function, Aesthetics, and Sensation (both Function and Satisfaction with Sensation). The work in which we are engaged is designed to use stakeholder feedback to identify the appropriate domains for HRQOL assessment and to make the feedback actionable by developing items to measure these important stakeholder- identified areas. The definitions and theoretical structure described throughout this manuscript are critical to the development of items that can measure these areas of function. This marks one of the initial efforts to systematically develop new scales that focus directly on issues of critical importance to those who have undergone UE transplant, but which are absent from existing HRQOL measurement systems. frontiersin.org Tyner et al. Conclusion Standardized, routine, and comprehensive evaluations of UE transplant outcomes are necessary to provide evidence to evaluate this treatment as part of the standard of care for UE injury or limb loss. Based on industry standards for PRO assessments of HRQOL and our completed qualitative research, we recommend that HRQOL assessment for this population includes both existing measures\u2014those that are applicable to many rehabilitation populations, such as measures of depression, anxiety, and pain\u2014as well as measures that are unique to the experience of UE transplant, covering emotional, social, and physical functioning.

These issues are layered upon the body image concerns experienced by UE amputees and involve the singular experience of aesthetically integrating donor tissue in a highly visible body location (whereas most solid-organ transplants occur with internal/non-visible tissue). Hence, we have chosen to develop outcomes measures in the physical HRQOL area, including Hand Function, Aesthetics, and Sensation (both Function and Satisfaction with Sensation). The work in which we are engaged is designed to use stakeholder feedback to identify the appropriate domains for HRQOL assessment and to make the feedback actionable by developing items to measure these important stakeholder- identified areas. The definitions and theoretical structure described throughout this manuscript are critical to the development of items that can measure these areas of function. This marks one of the initial efforts to systematically develop new scales that focus directly on issues of critical importance to those who have undergone UE transplant, but which are absent from existing HRQOL measurement systems. frontiersin.org Tyner et al. Conclusion Standardized, routine, and comprehensive evaluations of UE transplant outcomes are necessary to provide evidence to evaluate this treatment as part of the standard of care for UE injury or limb loss. Based on industry standards for PRO assessments of HRQOL and our completed qualitative research, we recommend that HRQOL assessment for this population includes both existing measures\u2014those that are applicable to many rehabilitation populations, such as measures of depression, anxiety, and pain\u2014as well as measures that are unique to the experience of UE transplant, covering emotional, social, and physical functioning. The eight newly developed PRO domains described herein were designed for this purpose. Future work is needed to finalize the development of new items in these domains and to ensure content validity.

In contrast, satisfaction with hand functioning as experienced by UE transplant recipients appears to merit a new HRQOL content domain, as difficulties and frustrations with the responsivity and ease of movement of the transplanted limbs/hands are distinct for this population, where capabilities improve gradually with treatment and nerve regrowth\u2014or sometimes not at all. Likewise, the challenges with sensation and aesthetic satisfaction are also unique to UE transplant. Although there are other clinical groups (e.g., spinal cord injury) where UE sensation can be impacted by injury, and the process of developing sensory-motor control for advanced prosthetic limb users has some similarities (Graczyk et al., 2019; Sensinger and Dosen, 2020), the experience of regaining sensory capabilities as donor nerves become reinnervated is distinct in limb transplant.

From a medical/surgical perspective, satisfaction with the transplant is a broad and vital area for assessment. Based on our stakeholder input and experience with PRO development, we chose to divide the topic of physical HRQOL after UE transplant into three areas: Function, Sensation, and Aesthetics. Frontiers in Psychology 07 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.989593 Functional abilities of the transplanted limb can be evaluated similarly to any surgical population, considering, for example, range of motion, grip strength, pain, and the various activities of daily living that require manual motor function and dexterity to complete. Thus, we believe that assessment of functional ability is best left to existing measures, such as SCI-FI Fine Motor, SCI-FI Self-Care, PROMIS Upper Extremity (Jette et al., 2012; Tulsky et al., 2012; Kaat et al., 2019), or Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity- Fine Motor (Cella et al., 2012; Gershon et al., 2012). In contrast, satisfaction with hand functioning as experienced by UE transplant recipients appears to merit a new HRQOL content domain, as difficulties and frustrations with the responsivity and ease of movement of the transplanted limbs/hands are distinct for this population, where capabilities improve gradually with treatment and nerve regrowth\u2014or sometimes not at all. Likewise, the challenges with sensation and aesthetic satisfaction are also unique to UE transplant. Although there are other clinical groups (e.g., spinal cord injury) where UE sensation can be impacted by injury, and the process of developing sensory-motor control for advanced prosthetic limb users has some similarities (Graczyk et al., 2019; Sensinger and Dosen, 2020), the experience of regaining sensory capabilities as donor nerves become reinnervated is distinct in limb transplant. There are similarities for UE transplant recipients to the benefits experienced from targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) in terms of reduced phantom limb pain and neuroma- related pain (Morgan et al., 2016; Tintle et al., 2016; Dumanian et al., 2019), and similarities with both invasive (e.g., targeted sensory reinnervation) and non-invasive (e.g., armband-based stimulators) technologies for restoring sensory input with prosthetic or bionic devices (Bensmaia et al., 2020), although ideally the outcome of the VCA transplant will go further than any one of these approaches and restore more natural motor control and sensation to the injured limb. Furthermore, the aesthetic and cosmetic aspects are of central concern for many patients (e.g., concerns about mismatched skin tone, body hair color/texture, and musculature/ size/bulk of transplanted limb). These issues are layered upon the body image concerns experienced by UE amputees and involve the singular experience of aesthetically integrating donor tissue in a highly visible body location (whereas most solid-organ transplants occur with internal/non-visible tissue). Hence, we have chosen to develop outcomes measures in the physical HRQOL area, including Hand Function, Aesthetics, and Sensation (both Function and Satisfaction with Sensation). The work in which we are engaged is designed to use stakeholder feedback to identify the appropriate domains for HRQOL assessment and to make the feedback actionable by developing items to measure these important stakeholder- identified areas. The definitions and theoretical structure described throughout this manuscript are critical to the development of items that can measure these areas of function. This marks one of the initial efforts to systematically develop new scales that focus directly on issues of critical importance to those who have undergone UE transplant, but which are absent from existing HRQOL measurement systems. frontiersin.org Tyner et al. Conclusion Standardized, routine, and comprehensive evaluations of UE transplant outcomes are necessary to provide evidence to evaluate this treatment as part of the standard of care for UE injury or limb loss. Based on industry standards for PRO assessments of HRQOL and our completed qualitative research, we recommend that HRQOL assessment for this population includes both existing measures\u2014those that are applicable to many rehabilitation populations, such as measures of depression, anxiety, and pain\u2014as well as measures that are unique to the experience of UE transplant, covering emotional, social, and physical functioning. The eight newly developed PRO domains described herein were designed for this purpose. Future work is needed to finalize the development of new items in these domains and to ensure content validity.
