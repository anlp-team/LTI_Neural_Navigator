Viruses 2023, 15, 244 Based on the internal gene sequences, six lineages (C/Taylor, C/Yamagata, C/Sao Paulo, C/Aichi, C/Kanagawa, and C/Mississippi) of in\ufb02uenza C viruses and four lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, and D/Yama2019) of in\ufb02uenza D viruses were classi\ufb01ed into two groups, respectively; C/Yamagata and C/Mississippi for in\ufb02uenza C viruses [10] and D/OK and D/Yama2016 for in\ufb02uenza D viruses [24]. We found no signi\ufb01cant differences in the IC50 values for baloxavir among the distinct lineages of in\ufb02uenza C or D viruses. The median IC50 values for baloxavir were 10.89 nM in MDCK cells and 10.32 nM in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza C viruses and 48.10 nM in MDCK cells and 31.08 nM in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza D viruses, respectively. The fold-changes in IC50 values compared with the median value for tested viruses were 0.6- to 2.3-fold in MDCK cells and 0.8- to 1.7-fold in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza C viruses and 0.9- to 1.1-fold in MDCK cells and 0.4- to 1.2-fold in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza D viruses, respectively. These results suggest that in\ufb02uenza C viruses are more susceptible to baloxavir than in\ufb02uenza D viruses, consistent with a previous study [14]. All In\ufb02uenza C and D viruses tested had comparable IC50 values for favipiravir. The median IC50 values for favipiravir were 20.91 \u00b5M in MDCK cells and 20.76 \u00b5M in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza C viruses and 17.37 \u00b5M in MDCK cells and 27.16 \u00b5M in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza D viruses, respectively. The fold-changes in IC50 values compared with the median value for tested viruses were 0.6- to 1.4-fold in MDCK cells and 0.8- to 2.8-fold in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza C viruses and 0.7- to 2.1-fold in MDCK cells and 0.4- to 1.7-fold in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza D viruses, respectively. The IC50 values of the reference B viruses for favipiravir were similar to those of in\ufb02uenza C viruses, as previously reported [13], suggesting that favipiravir susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza B viruses are approximately comparable to those of in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses. The I38T substitution in the PA protein that is associated with baloxavir resistance emerged after baloxavir treatment in the Phase II and III clinical trials of baloxavir [3,31\u201333]. No mutant viruses with reduced susceptibility to favipiravir emerged after favipiravir treatment in clinical trials of favipiravir; however, in vitro studies have shown that a K229R substitution in the PB1 protein confers about a 30-fold reduction in favipiravir susceptibility of in\ufb02uenza A viruses [34]. We therefore checked for amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to baloxavir and favipiravir in the in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses used in this study"}, {"question": " How many lineages of influenza D viruses were classified based on internal gene sequences?,answer: Four lineages", "ref_chunk": "C/Aichi C/Kanagawa C/Mississippi D/OK D/660 D/Yama2016 D/Yama2019 C/Ann Arbor/1/50 C/Yamagata/15/2004 C/Yamagata/32/2014 C/Yamagata/4/92 C/Yamagata/13/2014 C/Yamagata/3/2000 D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 D/bovine/Nebraska/9-5/2012 D/bovine/Yamagata/10710/2016 D/bovine/Yamagata/1/2019 7.73 \u00b1 2.67 6.20 \u00b1 0.92 8.49 \u00b1 3.75 19.74 \u00b1 3.39 13.28 \u00b1 3.89 24.83 \u00b1 9.48 49.83 \u00b1 5.02 51.02 \u00b1 12.11 44.51 \u00b1 9.12 46.36 \u00b1 6.47 22.37 \u00b1 3.58 13.20 \u00b1 1.15 19.44 \u00b1 3.45 24.72 \u00b1 1.38 17.54 \u00b1 2.41 28.62 \u00b1 4.85 35.83 \u00b1 12.83 13.68 \u00b1 3.55 12.48 \u00b1 2.71 21.05 \u00b1 1.49 11.29 \u00b1 0.58 8.87 \u00b1 1.90 11.45 \u00b1 1.26 8.19 \u00b1 1.87 9.35 \u00b1 2.41 17.48 \u00b1 6.00 13.91 \u00b1 1.48 34.76 \u00b1 1.94 27.40 \u00b1 3.22 36.75 \u00b1 5.86 20.07 \u00b1 10.00 21.45 \u00b1 3.46 16.16 \u00b1 5.18 16.86 \u00b1 5.63 58.34 \u00b1 14.33 22.22 \u00b1 6.47 20.81 \u00b1 1.27 46.86 \u00b1 8.63 10.21 \u00b1 1.47 33.51 \u00b1 4.52 A B A(H1N1)pdm09 A/Kanagawa/ZC1931/2019 (wild type) A/Kanagawa/IC1890/2019 (PA I38T) \u2020 A/Yokohama/136/2018 (wild type) A/Yokohama/133/2018 (PA I38T) \u2020 RG-B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (wild type) RG-B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (PA I38T) \u2020 A(H3N2) B/Yamagata 0.88 \u00b1 0.12 98.19 \u00b1 10.33 6.70 \u00b1 0.65 568.03 \u00b1 251.22 46.79 \u00b1 2.93 680.97 \u00b1 21.18 31.07 \u00b1 7.86 35.07 \u00b1 6.34 136.20 \u00b1 41.54 73.87 \u00b1 9.86 23.29 \u00b1 1.10 15.56 \u00b1 5.54 3.09 \u00b1 0.39 329.50 \u00b1 48.38 2.65 \u00b1 0.20 240.80 \u00b1 71.37 9.09 \u00b1 2.88 169.30 \u00b1 32.24 57.96 \u00b1 8.90 40.65 \u00b1 15.85 30.38 \u00b1 7.83 59.65 \u00b1 7.27 19.44 \u00b1 2.89 34.00 \u00b1 5.56 IC50: 50% inhibitory concentration; PA: polymerase acidic subunit; RG: reverse genetics. * The mean IC50 values of triplicate reactions were determined by using a focus reduction assay in MDCK cells or ST cells. \u2020 The I38T amino acid substitution in PA is associated with baloxavir resistance.

Viruses 2023, 15, 244 Based on the internal gene sequences, six lineages (C/Taylor, C/Yamagata, C/Sao Paulo, C/Aichi, C/Kanagawa, and C/Mississippi) of in\ufb02uenza C viruses and four lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, and D/Yama2019) of in\ufb02uenza D viruses were classi\ufb01ed into two groups, respectively; C/Yamagata and C/Mississippi for in\ufb02uenza C viruses [10] and D/OK and D/Yama2016 for in\ufb02uenza D viruses [24]. We found no signi\ufb01cant differences in the IC50 values for baloxavir among the distinct lineages of in\ufb02uenza C or D viruses. The median IC50 values for baloxavir were 10.89 nM in MDCK cells and 10.32 nM in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza C viruses and 48.10 nM in MDCK cells and 31.08 nM in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza D viruses, respectively. The fold-changes in IC50 values compared with the median value for tested viruses were 0.6- to 2.3-fold in MDCK cells and 0.8- to 1.7-fold in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza C viruses and 0.9- to 1.1-fold in MDCK cells and 0.4- to 1.2-fold in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza D viruses, respectively. These results suggest that in\ufb02uenza C viruses are more susceptible to baloxavir than in\ufb02uenza D viruses, consistent with a previous study [14]. All In\ufb02uenza C and D viruses tested had comparable IC50 values for favipiravir. The median IC50 values for favipiravir were 20.91 \u00b5M in MDCK cells and 20.76 \u00b5M in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza C viruses and 17.37 \u00b5M in MDCK cells and 27.16 \u00b5M in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza D viruses, respectively. The fold-changes in IC50 values compared with the median value for tested viruses were 0.6- to 1.4-fold in MDCK cells and 0.8- to 2.8-fold in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza C viruses and 0.7- to 2.1-fold in MDCK cells and 0.4- to 1.7-fold in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza D viruses, respectively. The IC50 values of the reference B viruses for favipiravir were similar to those of in\ufb02uenza C viruses, as previously reported [13], suggesting that favipiravir susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza B viruses are approximately comparable to those of in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses.

Reference A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Yamagata lineage viruses possessing the PA I38T substitution showed 110-, 85-, and 15-fold higher IC50 values in MDCK cells and 110-, 91-, and 19-fold higher IC50 values in ST cells, respectively, than their corresponding wild-type viruses for baloxavir. However, these I38T mutant viruses had comparable IC50 values for favipiravir to their corresponding wild-type viruses in MDCK cells (0.5- to 1.1-fold increase) and ST cells (0.7- to 2.0-fold increase). The wild-type B virus showed higher IC50 values for baloxavir than wild-type A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses in both cell types, consistent with previous reports using MDCK cells [3,16,30].

We found no signi\ufb01cant differences in the IC50 values for baloxavir among the distinct lineages of in\ufb02uenza C or D viruses.

Criteria to de\ufb01ne RNA polymerase inhibitor susceptibility have not yet been estab- lished; therefore, provisional criteria based on IC50 fold-change thresholds, compared to the median for wild-type viruses of the same type, subtype, and lineage, are used by the WHO-AVWG [9]. The provisional criteria de\ufb01ne in\ufb02uenza virus inhibition as normal (<3-fold increase) or reduced (\u22653-fold increase). Reference A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Yamagata lineage viruses possessing the PA I38T substitution showed 110-, 85-, and 15-fold higher IC50 values in MDCK cells and 110-, 91-, and 19-fold higher IC50 values in ST cells, respectively, than their corresponding wild-type viruses for baloxavir. However, these I38T mutant viruses had comparable IC50 values for favipiravir to their corresponding wild-type viruses in MDCK cells (0.5- to 1.1-fold increase) and ST cells (0.7- to 2.0-fold increase). The wild-type B virus showed higher IC50 values for baloxavir than wild-type A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses in both cell types, consistent with previous reports using MDCK cells [3,16,30].

Viruses 2023, 15, 244 Based on the internal gene sequences, six lineages (C/Taylor, C/Yamagata, C/Sao Paulo, C/Aichi, C/Kanagawa, and C/Mississippi) of in\ufb02uenza C viruses and four lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, and D/Yama2019) of in\ufb02uenza D viruses were classi\ufb01ed into two groups, respectively; C/Yamagata and C/Mississippi for in\ufb02uenza C viruses [10] and D/OK and D/Yama2016 for in\ufb02uenza D viruses [24]. We found no signi\ufb01cant differences in the IC50 values for baloxavir among the distinct lineages of in\ufb02uenza C or D viruses. The median IC50 values for baloxavir were 10.89 nM in MDCK cells and 10.32 nM in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza C viruses and 48.10 nM in MDCK cells and 31.08 nM in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza D viruses, respectively. The fold-changes in IC50 values compared with the median value for tested viruses were 0.6- to 2.3-fold in MDCK cells and 0.8- to 1.7-fold in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza C viruses and 0.9- to 1.1-fold in MDCK cells and 0.4- to 1.2-fold in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza D viruses, respectively. These results suggest that in\ufb02uenza C viruses are more susceptible to baloxavir than in\ufb02uenza D viruses, consistent with a previous study [14]. All In\ufb02uenza C and D viruses tested had comparable IC50 values for favipiravir. The median IC50 values for favipiravir were 20.91 \u00b5M in MDCK cells and 20.76 \u00b5M in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza C viruses and 17.37 \u00b5M in MDCK cells and 27.16 \u00b5M in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza D viruses, respectively. The fold-changes in IC50 values compared with the median value for tested viruses were 0.6- to 1.4-fold in MDCK cells and 0.8- to 2.8-fold in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza C viruses and 0.7- to 2.1-fold in MDCK cells and 0.4- to 1.7-fold in ST cells for in\ufb02uenza D viruses, respectively. The IC50 values of the reference B viruses for favipiravir were similar to those of in\ufb02uenza C viruses, as previously reported [13], suggesting that favipiravir susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza B viruses are approximately comparable to those of in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses. The I38T substitution in the PA protein that is associated with baloxavir resistance emerged after baloxavir treatment in the Phase II and III clinical trials of baloxavir [3,31\u201333]. No mutant viruses with reduced susceptibility to favipiravir emerged after favipiravir treatment in clinical trials of favipiravir; however, in vitro studies have shown that a K229R substitution in the PB1 protein confers about a 30-fold reduction in favipiravir susceptibility of in\ufb02uenza A viruses [34]. We therefore checked for amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to baloxavir and favipiravir in the in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses used in this study"}
