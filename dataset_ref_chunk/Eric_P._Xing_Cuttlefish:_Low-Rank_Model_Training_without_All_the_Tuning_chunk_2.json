In this paper, we introduce a novel method for automati- cally determining the hyperparameters associated with low- rank training, ensuring that the resulting factorized model achieves both a compact size and high \ufb01nal accuracy. Challenges. We would like to emphasize several reasons why this problem presents considerable challenges. Firstly, the search space S is vast. For a two hidden layer fully connected (FC) neural network with 100 neurons in each layer (assuming the rank for each layer is 100) and train- ing with 100 epochs, the cardinality of the search space is |S| = 100 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 2 = 2 \u00d7 106. Furthermore, our objective of automatically optimizing low-rank train- ing factorization hyperparameters while maintaining the advantages of end-to-end training speedups renders tradi- tional neural architecture search (NAS) methods impractical. NAS necessitates concurrent training of both network ar- chitecture and network weights, resulting in computational requirements that substantially exceed those of standard model training. 16 , 1 8 , 1 In this work, we present CUTTLEFISH, an automated low- rank factorized training method that eliminates the need for tuning factorization hyperparameters. We observe a key pattern in which the estimated rank of each layer changes Figure 2. The estimated ranks for various layers in ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10, using stable rank (which will be discussed in detail later), can be found in our results. The results for other tasks are available in the appendix. In addition to determining the factorization ranks and full- rank training duration, CUTTLEFISH also addresses the is- sue of deciding which layers to factorize. For convolutional neural networks (CNNs), CUTTLEFISH observes that factor- izing early layers does not lead to considerable speedups, as elaborated in Section 3.5. This observation, along with in- sights from prior research (Wang et al., 2021a), implies that factorizing early layers may negatively affect the \ufb01nal model accuracy without offering signi\ufb01cant performance gains. To tackle this challenge, CUTTLEFISH performs lightweight pro\ufb01ling to identify the layers to factorize, ensuring that fac- torization occurs only in layers that can effectively enhance the training speed. Our contributions. We observe a stabilizing effect in the stable ranks of neural network (NN) layers during training, where their stable ranks initially change rapidly and then converge to a constant. Based on this observation, we de- vise a heuristic to adaptively select the rank of each layer and the duration of full-rank warm-up training. We im- plement our technique, called CUTTLEFISH, and assess it in large-scale training environments for both language and computer vision tasks. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that CUTTLEFISH automatically selects all factorization hyperparameters during training on-the-\ufb02y, eliminating the need for multiple experimental trials for fac- torization hyperparameter tuning. CUTTLEFISH strikes a balance between model size and \ufb01nal predictive accuracy, excelling in at least one dimension of producing smaller, more accurate models and achieving considerable training speedups compared to state-of-the-art low-rank training, structured pruning, sparse training, quantized training, and learnable factorization methods (Rastegari et al., 2016; Fran- kle et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a; Yu & Huang, 2019; You CUTTLEFISH: Low-rank Model Training without All The Tuning et al., 2019; Idelbayev & Carreira-Perpin\u00b4an, 2020; Khodak et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021a). 1.1 Related work. Several methods have been developed in the literature to eliminate redundancy in the parameters of modern NNs. Model compression strives to eliminate redundancy in the parameters of trained NNs (Han et al., 2015a). Over time, numerous methods have been devised to remove redundant weights in NNs, encompassing pruning (Li et al., 2016; Wen et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016; Zhu & Gupta, 2017; He et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018; 2019; Sreenivasan et al., 2022a), quantization (Rastegari et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016; Hubara et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Hubara et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017), low-rank fac- torization (Xue et al., 2013; Sainath et al., 2013; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Wiesler et al., 2014; Kone\u02c7cn`y et al., 2016), and knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2019; Sanh et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023). The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests that smaller, randomly initialized subnetworks can be trained to attain accuracy levels comparable to those of the full network, al- though pinpointing these subnetworks can be computation- ally challenging (Frankle & Carbin, 2018). Iterative Mag- nitude Pruning (IMP) was devised to stabilize LTH while reducing computational costs through warm-up steps (Fran- kle et al., 2019). Other efforts have sought to eliminate the need for model weight rewinding (Renda et al., 2020) and to identify winning tickets at initialization (Wang et al., 2020a; Sreenivasan et al., 2022b). Moreover, researchers have explored sparsifying NNs during training (Evci et al., 2020). However, these sparsi\ufb01cation methods focus on un- structured sparsity, which does not yield actual speedups on current hardware. In contrast, low-rank training can lead to tangible acceleration. Low-rank factorized training, as well as other structured pruning methods, aim to achieve NNs with structured spar- sity during training, allowing for tangible speedups to be obtained (Waleffe & Rekatsinas, 2020; Khodak et al., 2020; You et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021a; Chen et al., 2021b). Low-rank factorized training has also been employed in federated learning methods to improve communication ef\ufb01- ciency and hardware heterogeneity awareness (Hyeon-Woo et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2021). Low-rank factorization tech- niques have been shown to be combinable and used for train- ing low-rank networks from scratch (Ioannou et al., 2015). However, this method results in a noticeable loss of accu- racy, as demonstrated in (Wang et al., 2021a). To tackle this problem, (Khodak et al., 2020) introduces spectral initial- ization and Frobenius decay, while (Vodrahalli et al., 2022) proposes the Nonlinear Kernel Projection method as an alternative to SVD. Low-rank training has also been inves- tigated for \ufb01ne-tuning large-scale pre-trained"}, {"question": " Why is the search space considered vast in the paper?", "answer": " The search space is vast because for a two hidden layer fully connected neural network with 100 neurons in each layer and training with 100 epochs, the cardinality of the search space is 2 x 10^6.", "ref_chunk": "The rank ratio varies among { 1 4 , 1 32 , 1 2 }.

This observation, along with in- sights from prior research (Wang et al., 2021a), implies that factorizing early layers may negatively affect the \ufb01nal model accuracy without offering signi\ufb01cant performance gains. To tackle this challenge, CUTTLEFISH performs lightweight pro\ufb01ling to identify the layers to factorize, ensuring that fac- torization occurs only in layers that can effectively enhance the training speed. Our contributions. We observe a stabilizing effect in the stable ranks of neural network (NN) layers during training, where their stable ranks initially change rapidly and then converge to a constant. Based on this observation, we de- vise a heuristic to adaptively select the rank of each layer and the duration of full-rank warm-up training. We im- plement our technique, called CUTTLEFISH, and assess it in large-scale training environments for both language and computer vision tasks. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that CUTTLEFISH automatically selects all factorization hyperparameters during training on-the-\ufb02y, eliminating the need for multiple experimental trials for fac- torization hyperparameter tuning. CUTTLEFISH strikes a balance between model size and \ufb01nal predictive accuracy, excelling in at least one dimension of producing smaller, more accurate models and achieving considerable training speedups compared to state-of-the-art low-rank training, structured pruning, sparse training, quantized training, and learnable factorization methods (Rastegari et al., 2016; Fran- kle et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a; Yu & Huang, 2019; You CUTTLEFISH: Low-rank Model Training without All The Tuning et al., 2019; Idelbayev & Carreira-Perpin\u00b4an, 2020; Khodak et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021a). 1.1 Related work. Several methods have been developed in the literature to eliminate redundancy in the parameters of modern NNs. Model compression strives to eliminate redundancy in the parameters of trained NNs (Han et al., 2015a). Over time, numerous methods have been devised to remove redundant weights in NNs, encompassing pruning (Li et al., 2016; Wen et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016; Zhu & Gupta, 2017; He et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018; 2019; Sreenivasan et al., 2022a), quantization (Rastegari et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016; Hubara et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Hubara et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017), low-rank fac- torization (Xue et al., 2013; Sainath et al., 2013; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Wiesler et al., 2014; Kone\u02c7cn`y et al., 2016), and knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2019; Sanh et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023). The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests that smaller, randomly initialized subnetworks can be trained to attain accuracy levels comparable to those of the full network, al- though pinpointing these subnetworks can be computation- ally challenging (Frankle & Carbin, 2018). Iterative Mag- nitude Pruning (IMP) was devised to stabilize LTH while reducing computational costs through warm-up steps (Fran- kle et al., 2019). Other efforts have sought to eliminate the need for model weight rewinding (Renda et al., 2020) and to identify winning tickets at initialization (Wang et al., 2020a; Sreenivasan et al., 2022b). Moreover, researchers have explored sparsifying NNs during training (Evci et al., 2020). However, these sparsi\ufb01cation methods focus on un- structured sparsity, which does not yield actual speedups on current hardware. In contrast, low-rank training can lead to tangible acceleration. Low-rank factorized training, as well as other structured pruning methods, aim to achieve NNs with structured spar- sity during training, allowing for tangible speedups to be obtained (Waleffe & Rekatsinas, 2020; Khodak et al., 2020; You et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021a; Chen et al., 2021b). Low-rank factorized training has also been employed in federated learning methods to improve communication ef\ufb01- ciency and hardware heterogeneity awareness (Hyeon-Woo et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2021). Low-rank factorization tech- niques have been shown to be combinable and used for train- ing low-rank networks from scratch (Ioannou et al., 2015). However, this method results in a noticeable loss of accu- racy, as demonstrated in (Wang et al., 2021a). To tackle this problem, (Khodak et al., 2020) introduces spectral initial- ization and Frobenius decay, while (Vodrahalli et al., 2022) proposes the Nonlinear Kernel Projection method as an alternative to SVD.

Over time, numerous methods have been devised to remove redundant weights in NNs, encompassing pruning (Li et al., 2016; Wen et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016; Zhu & Gupta, 2017; He et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018; 2019; Sreenivasan et al., 2022a), quantization (Rastegari et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016; Hubara et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Hubara et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017), low-rank fac- torization (Xue et al., 2013; Sainath et al., 2013; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Wiesler et al., 2014; Kone\u02c7cn`y et al., 2016), and knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2019; Sanh et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023). The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests that smaller, randomly initialized subnetworks can be trained to attain accuracy levels comparable to those of the full network, al- though pinpointing these subnetworks can be computation- ally challenging (Frankle & Carbin, 2018). Iterative Mag- nitude Pruning (IMP) was devised to stabilize LTH while reducing computational costs through warm-up steps (Fran- kle et al., 2019). Other efforts have sought to eliminate the need for model weight rewinding (Renda et al., 2020) and to identify winning tickets at initialization (Wang et al., 2020a; Sreenivasan et al., 2022b). Moreover, researchers have explored sparsifying NNs during training (Evci et al., 2020). However, these sparsi\ufb01cation methods focus on un- structured sparsity, which does not yield actual speedups on current hardware. In contrast, low-rank training can lead to tangible acceleration. Low-rank factorized training, as well as other structured pruning methods, aim to achieve NNs with structured spar- sity during training, allowing for tangible speedups to be obtained (Waleffe & Rekatsinas, 2020; Khodak et al., 2020; You et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021a; Chen et al., 2021b). Low-rank factorized training has also been employed in federated learning methods to improve communication ef\ufb01- ciency and hardware heterogeneity awareness (Hyeon-Woo et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2021). Low-rank factorization tech- niques have been shown to be combinable and used for train- ing low-rank networks from scratch (Ioannou et al., 2015). However, this method results in a noticeable loss of accu- racy, as demonstrated in (Wang et al., 2021a). To tackle this problem, (Khodak et al., 2020) introduces spectral initial- ization and Frobenius decay, while (Vodrahalli et al., 2022) proposes the Nonlinear Kernel Projection method as an alternative to SVD. Low-rank training has also been inves- tigated for \ufb01ne-tuning large-scale pre-trained"}, {"question": " What do sparsity methods mainly focus on according to the paper?", "answer": " Sparsity methods mainly focus on unstructured sparsity, which does not yield actual speedups on current hardware, unlike low-rank training which can lead to tangible acceleration.", "ref_chunk": "The rank ratio varies among { 1 4 , 1 32 , 1 2 }. Experiments ran on ResNet-18 trained over CIFAR-10. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for automati- cally determining the hyperparameters associated with low- rank training, ensuring that the resulting factorized model achieves both a compact size and high \ufb01nal accuracy. Challenges. We would like to emphasize several reasons why this problem presents considerable challenges. Firstly, the search space S is vast. For a two hidden layer fully connected (FC) neural network with 100 neurons in each layer (assuming the rank for each layer is 100) and train- ing with 100 epochs, the cardinality of the search space is |S| = 100 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 2 = 2 \u00d7 106. Furthermore, our objective of automatically optimizing low-rank train- ing factorization hyperparameters while maintaining the advantages of end-to-end training speedups renders tradi- tional neural architecture search (NAS) methods impractical. NAS necessitates concurrent training of both network ar- chitecture and network weights, resulting in computational requirements that substantially exceed those of standard model training. 16 , 1 8 , 1 In this work, we present CUTTLEFISH, an automated low- rank factorized training method that eliminates the need for tuning factorization hyperparameters. We observe a key pattern in which the estimated rank of each layer changes Figure 2. The estimated ranks for various layers in ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10, using stable rank (which will be discussed in detail later), can be found in our results. The results for other tasks are available in the appendix. In addition to determining the factorization ranks and full- rank training duration, CUTTLEFISH also addresses the is- sue of deciding which layers to factorize. For convolutional neural networks (CNNs), CUTTLEFISH observes that factor- izing early layers does not lead to considerable speedups, as elaborated in Section 3.5. This observation, along with in- sights from prior research (Wang et al., 2021a), implies that factorizing early layers may negatively affect the \ufb01nal model accuracy without offering signi\ufb01cant performance gains. To tackle this challenge, CUTTLEFISH performs lightweight pro\ufb01ling to identify the layers to factorize, ensuring that fac- torization occurs only in layers that can effectively enhance the training speed. Our contributions. We observe a stabilizing effect in the stable ranks of neural network (NN) layers during training, where their stable ranks initially change rapidly and then converge to a constant. Based on this observation, we de- vise a heuristic to adaptively select the rank of each layer and the duration of full-rank warm-up training. We im- plement our technique, called CUTTLEFISH, and assess it in large-scale training environments for both language and computer vision tasks. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that CUTTLEFISH automatically selects all factorization hyperparameters during training on-the-\ufb02y, eliminating the need for multiple experimental trials for fac- torization hyperparameter tuning. CUTTLEFISH strikes a balance between model size and \ufb01nal predictive accuracy, excelling in at least one dimension of producing smaller, more accurate models and achieving considerable training speedups compared to state-of-the-art low-rank training, structured pruning, sparse training, quantized training, and learnable factorization methods (Rastegari et al., 2016; Fran- kle et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a; Yu & Huang, 2019; You CUTTLEFISH: Low-rank Model Training without All The Tuning et al., 2019; Idelbayev & Carreira-Perpin\u00b4an, 2020; Khodak et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021a). 1.1 Related work.
