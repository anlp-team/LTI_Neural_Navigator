They usually represent items using ids, randomly initialize item id embeddings, and optimize these embeddings using the signals from user-item interactions. Existing item id based recommendation systems usually face the popularity bias problem [1, 2, 73]. As shown in Figure 1(a), the distribution of items in recommendation benchmarks is long-tailed, making the item id based recommendation model (T5-ID) usually face the \u201cCold Start\u201d problem [33, 51]. In Figure 1(b), about 74% golden items are interacted less than 20 times with users, but T5-ID returns more popular items in the recommendation results.

T5-ID learns a non-smooth anisotropic embedding space [19, 34, 47], which makes the popular items and other items distinguished. As shown in Figure 2(b), TASTE which represents items with full texts provides some opportunities to alleviate the popularity bias by mixing up the embeddings of popu- lar items and others.

We sort items according to the user-item in- teraction frequencies and plot the user-interacted frequency distribution of items in Figure 1(a). Then we conduct item statistics of different user-item interaction frequencies. The ground truth and top-5 items that are predicted by T5-ID are shown in Figure 1(b). T5-ID is an item id based recommenda- tion model, which predicts the id of the next item. The items are divided into different groups according to the frequency. more text-relevant but long-tailed items for users by matching text representations of users and items. In this paper, we propose Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommendation (TASTE), which represents items and users with texts, establishes relevance between them by matching their text representations and alleviates the popularity bias of previous item id based recommendation models. TASTE verbalizes users and items by designing some prompts [39] and filling up the templates with item ids and item attributes. The item information provides text- matching clues to model the dependency and relevance among users and items. TASTE also proposes an attention sparsity en- coding technology to break the max length boundary of language models [3] and encode long text representations of user-item inter- actions. It separates the user-item interaction into different sessions, independently encodes the text representation of each session, and reduces the attention computation. Our experiments demonstrate that TASTE surpasses previous sequential recommendation baselines [52, 58, 71] with over 18% improvements on Yelp and Amazon Product datasets.

They usually represent items using ids, randomly initialize item id embeddings, and optimize these embeddings using the signals from user-item interactions. Existing item id based recommendation systems usually face the popularity bias problem [1, 2, 73]. As shown in Figure 1(a), the distribution of items in recommendation benchmarks is long-tailed, making the item id based recommendation model (T5-ID) usually face the \u201cCold Start\u201d problem [33, 51]. In Figure 1(b), about 74% golden items are interacted less than 20 times with users, but T5-ID returns more popular items in the recommendation results. It re- sults in the popularity bias\u2013just follow the crowd and return popular items as results. Furthermore, we visualize the embedding distribu- tion of T5-ID in Figure 2(a). T5-ID learns a non-smooth anisotropic embedding space [19, 34, 47], which makes the popular items and other items distinguished. As shown in Figure 2(b), TASTE which represents items with full texts provides some opportunities to alleviate the popularity bias by mixing up the embeddings of popu- lar items and others.

Figure 1: Item Distributions with Different User-Item Interac- tion Frequencies. We sort items according to the user-item in- teraction frequencies and plot the user-interacted frequency distribution of items in Figure 1(a). Then we conduct item statistics of different user-item interaction frequencies. The ground truth and top-5 items that are predicted by T5-ID are shown in Figure 1(b). T5-ID is an item id based recommenda- tion model, which predicts the id of the next item. The items are divided into different groups according to the frequency. more text-relevant but long-tailed items for users by matching text representations of users and items. In this paper, we propose Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommendation (TASTE), which represents items and users with texts, establishes relevance between them by matching their text representations and alleviates the popularity bias of previous item id based recommendation models. TASTE verbalizes users and items by designing some prompts [39] and filling up the templates with item ids and item attributes. The item information provides text- matching clues to model the dependency and relevance among users and items. TASTE also proposes an attention sparsity en- coding technology to break the max length boundary of language models [3] and encode long text representations of user-item inter- actions. It separates the user-item interaction into different sessions, independently encodes the text representation of each session, and reduces the attention computation. Our experiments demonstrate that TASTE surpasses previous sequential recommendation baselines [52, 58, 71] with over 18% improvements on Yelp and Amazon Product datasets. Our analyses show that, compared with item id based recommendation models, TASTE shows its ability in alleviating the popularity bias problem and recommends more than 18% long-tail items for users compared to T5-ID.

TASTE verbalizes items and user-item interactions using identifiers and attributes of items. To better characterize user be- haviors, TASTE additionally proposes an attention sparsity method, which enables TASTE to model longer user-item interactions by reducing the self-attention computations during encoding. Our ex- periments show that TASTE outperforms the state-of-the-art meth- ods on widely used sequential recommendation datasets. TASTE alleviates the cold start problem by representing long-tail items using full-text modeling and bringing the benefits of pretrained language models to recommendation systems. Our further anal- yses illustrate that TASTE significantly improves the recommen- dation accuracy by reducing the popularity bias of previous item id based recommendation models and returning more appropriate and text-relevant items to satisfy users.

They usually represent items using ids, randomly initialize item id embeddings, and optimize these embeddings using the signals from user-item interactions. Existing item id based recommendation systems usually face the popularity bias problem [1, 2, 73]. As shown in Figure 1(a), the distribution of items in recommendation benchmarks is long-tailed, making the item id based recommendation model (T5-ID) usually face the \u201cCold Start\u201d problem [33, 51]. In Figure 1(b), about 74% golden items are interacted less than 20 times with users, but T5-ID returns more popular items in the recommendation results. It re- sults in the popularity bias\u2013just follow the crowd and return popular items as results. Furthermore, we visualize the embedding distribu- tion of T5-ID in Figure 2(a). T5-ID learns a non-smooth anisotropic embedding space [19, 34, 47], which makes the popular items and other items distinguished. As shown in Figure 2(b), TASTE which represents items with full texts provides some opportunities to alleviate the popularity bias by mixing up the embeddings of popu- lar items and others.

Figure 1: Item Distributions with Different User-Item Interac- tion Frequencies. We sort items according to the user-item in- teraction frequencies and plot the user-interacted frequency distribution of items in Figure 1(a). Then we conduct item statistics of different user-item interaction frequencies. The ground truth and top-5 items that are predicted by T5-ID are shown in Figure 1(b). T5-ID is an item id based recommenda- tion model, which predicts the id of the next item. The items are divided into different groups according to the frequency. more text-relevant but long-tailed items for users by matching text representations of users and items. In this paper, we propose Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommendation (TASTE), which represents items and users with texts, establishes relevance between them by matching their text representations and alleviates the popularity bias of previous item id based recommendation models. TASTE verbalizes users and items by designing some prompts [39] and filling up the templates with item ids and item attributes. The item information provides text- matching clues to model the dependency and relevance among users and items. TASTE also proposes an attention sparsity en- coding technology to break the max length boundary of language models [3] and encode long text representations of user-item inter- actions. It separates the user-item interaction into different sessions, independently encodes the text representation of each session, and reduces the attention computation.
