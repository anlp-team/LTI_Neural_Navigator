As shown in the fully adjusted model, AGR was positively associated with OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib. In addition, we converted AGR into a categorical variable and the same positive correlation trend was observed. The non-isometric changes of hazard ratio indicated that there may be a non-linear relationship between AGR and OS. Therefore, we further used GAM and two-piecewise linear regres- sion model to explore the relationship between AGR and OS, and clarified it was non-linear, and the correlation between AGR and OS was different on the left and right sides of the inflection point (AGR = 1.24). This result sug- gested that AGR was not correlated with OS on the left side of the inflection point (AGR \u2264 1.24), but AGR was positively correlated with OS when AGR was higher than 1.24, and for every 1 unit increase in AGR, the risk of death was reduced by 80%, which means AGR may be a promising prognostic indicator in clinical practices. Current studies focusing on the relationship between inflammation and malignant tumor have found that the host systemic inflammatory response and tumor micro- environment are both crucial in tumor initiation, pro- gression and metastasis [19, 20]. This has also been confirmed in lung cancer [21\u201323]. Albumin and globulin are major serum proteins, which can reflect the systemic inflammatory response. Albumin regulates systemic inflammatory reaction and exert an influence on antioxi- dant effects. Low albumin levels have been confirmed to be a useful prognostic tool for lung cancer [24, 25]. Glob- ulin increases with the accumulation of acute-phase pro- teins and immunoglobulins, which reflect immune and inflammatory states [26]. As mentioned above, both albu- min and globulin could be involved in cancer progres- sion in various ways and play crucial roles. Based on this, the AGR, which accounts for the values of both albumin and globulin, has been used as one of the inflammatory parameters to assess the systemic inflammatory status of the host [27]. Meanwhile, several studies have attempted to explore the prognostic value of AGR in malignant tumors. Our study results were consistent with those reported by Suh et al. who conducted a large retrospec- tive study in generally healthy adults and found that low AGR was a risk factor for cancer morbidity and mortal- ity [16]. Hua Zhang et al. suggested that the preoperative AGR might be a predictor of postoperative chemotherapy efficacy in patients with stage II and III NSCLC [6].

In addition, we converted AGR into a categorical variable and the same positive correlation trend was observed. The non-isometric changes of hazard ratio indicated that there may be a non-linear relationship between AGR and OS. Therefore, we further used GAM and two-piecewise linear regres- sion model to explore the relationship between AGR and OS, and clarified it was non-linear, and the correlation between AGR and OS was different on the left and right sides of the inflection point (AGR = 1.24). This result sug- gested that AGR was not correlated with OS on the left side of the inflection point (AGR \u2264 1.24), but AGR was positively correlated with OS when AGR was higher than 1.24, and for every 1 unit increase in AGR, the risk of death was reduced by 80%, which means AGR may be a promising prognostic indicator in clinical practices. Current studies focusing on the relationship between inflammation and malignant tumor have found that the host systemic inflammatory response and tumor micro- environment are both crucial in tumor initiation, pro- gression and metastasis [19, 20]. This has also been confirmed in lung cancer [21\u201323]. Albumin and globulin are major serum proteins, which can reflect the systemic inflammatory response. Albumin regulates systemic inflammatory reaction and exert an influence on antioxi- dant effects. Low albumin levels have been confirmed to be a useful prognostic tool for lung cancer [24, 25]. Glob- ulin increases with the accumulation of acute-phase pro- teins and immunoglobulins, which reflect immune and inflammatory states [26]. As mentioned above, both albu- min and globulin could be involved in cancer progres- sion in various ways and play crucial roles. Based on this, the AGR, which accounts for the values of both albumin and globulin, has been used as one of the inflammatory parameters to assess the systemic inflammatory status of the host [27]. Meanwhile, several studies have attempted to explore the prognostic value of AGR in malignant tumors.

As shown in the fully adjusted model, AGR was positively associated with OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib. In addition, we converted AGR into a categorical variable and the same positive correlation trend was observed. The non-isometric changes of hazard ratio indicated that there may be a non-linear relationship between AGR and OS. Therefore, we further used GAM and two-piecewise linear regres- sion model to explore the relationship between AGR and OS, and clarified it was non-linear, and the correlation between AGR and OS was different on the left and right sides of the inflection point (AGR = 1.24). This result sug- gested that AGR was not correlated with OS on the left side of the inflection point (AGR \u2264 1.24), but AGR was positively correlated with OS when AGR was higher than 1.24, and for every 1 unit increase in AGR, the risk of death was reduced by 80%, which means AGR may be a promising prognostic indicator in clinical practices. Current studies focusing on the relationship between inflammation and malignant tumor have found that the host systemic inflammatory response and tumor micro- environment are both crucial in tumor initiation, pro- gression and metastasis [19, 20]. This has also been confirmed in lung cancer [21\u201323]. Albumin and globulin are major serum proteins, which can reflect the systemic inflammatory response. Albumin regulates systemic inflammatory reaction and exert an influence on antioxi- dant effects. Low albumin levels have been confirmed to be a useful prognostic tool for lung cancer [24, 25]. Glob- ulin increases with the accumulation of acute-phase pro- teins and immunoglobulins, which reflect immune and inflammatory states [26]. As mentioned above, both albu- min and globulin could be involved in cancer progres- sion in various ways and play crucial roles. Based on this, the AGR, which accounts for the values of both albumin and globulin, has been used as one of the inflammatory parameters to assess the systemic inflammatory status of the host [27]. Meanwhile, several studies have attempted to explore the prognostic value of AGR in malignant tumors.

As shown in the fully adjusted model, AGR was positively associated with OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib. In addition, we converted AGR into a categorical variable and the same positive correlation trend was observed. The non-isometric changes of hazard ratio indicated that there may be a non-linear relationship between AGR and OS. Therefore, we further used GAM and two-piecewise linear regres- sion model to explore the relationship between AGR and OS, and clarified it was non-linear, and the correlation between AGR and OS was different on the left and right sides of the inflection point (AGR = 1.24). This result sug- gested that AGR was not correlated with OS on the left side of the inflection point (AGR \u2264 1.24), but AGR was positively correlated with OS when AGR was higher than 1.24, and for every 1 unit increase in AGR, the risk of death was reduced by 80%, which means AGR may be a promising prognostic indicator in clinical practices. Current studies focusing on the relationship between inflammation and malignant tumor have found that the host systemic inflammatory response and tumor micro- environment are both crucial in tumor initiation, pro- gression and metastasis [19, 20]. This has also been confirmed in lung cancer [21\u201323]. Albumin and globulin are major serum proteins, which can reflect the systemic inflammatory response. Albumin regulates systemic inflammatory reaction and exert an influence on antioxi- dant effects. Low albumin levels have been confirmed to be a useful prognostic tool for lung cancer [24, 25]. Glob- ulin increases with the accumulation of acute-phase pro- teins and immunoglobulins, which reflect immune and inflammatory states [26]. As mentioned above, both albu- min and globulin could be involved in cancer progres- sion in various ways and play crucial roles. Based on this, the AGR, which accounts for the values of both albumin and globulin, has been used as one of the inflammatory parameters to assess the systemic inflammatory status of the host [27]. Meanwhile, several studies have attempted to explore the prognostic value of AGR in malignant tumors. Our study results were consistent with those reported by Suh et al. who conducted a large retrospec- tive study in generally healthy adults and found that low AGR was a risk factor for cancer morbidity and mortal- ity [16].

For patients with the ECOG PS score = 1, the association between AGR and risk of death had a trend but was not statistically significant (HR = 1.52, 95% CI: 0.42 to 5.48). Discussion Although several papers have suggested a relationship between AGR and prognosis in patients with various types of cancers [6, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18], this evidence in NSCLC remains limited. As we know, our study is the first to explore AGR as a prognostic marker in advanced NSCLC patients with anlotinib treatment.

As shown in the fully adjusted model, AGR was positively associated with OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib. In addition, we converted AGR into a categorical variable and the same positive correlation trend was observed. The non-isometric changes of hazard ratio indicated that there may be a non-linear relationship between AGR and OS. Therefore, we further used GAM and two-piecewise linear regres- sion model to explore the relationship between AGR and OS, and clarified it was non-linear, and the correlation between AGR and OS was different on the left and right sides of the inflection point (AGR = 1.24). This result sug- gested that AGR was not correlated with OS on the left side of the inflection point (AGR \u2264 1.24), but AGR was positively correlated with OS when AGR was higher than 1.24, and for every 1 unit increase in AGR, the risk of death was reduced by 80%, which means AGR may be a promising prognostic indicator in clinical practices. Current studies focusing on the relationship between inflammation and malignant tumor have found that the host systemic inflammatory response and tumor micro- environment are both crucial in tumor initiation, pro- gression and metastasis [19, 20]. This has also been confirmed in lung cancer [21\u201323]. Albumin and globulin are major serum proteins, which can reflect the systemic inflammatory response. Albumin regulates systemic inflammatory reaction and exert an influence on antioxi- dant effects. Low albumin levels have been confirmed to be a useful prognostic tool for lung cancer [24, 25]. Glob- ulin increases with the accumulation of acute-phase pro- teins and immunoglobulins, which reflect immune and inflammatory states [26]. As mentioned above, both albu- min and globulin could be involved in cancer progres- sion in various ways and play crucial roles. Based on this, the AGR, which accounts for the values of both albumin and globulin, has been used as one of the inflammatory parameters to assess the systemic inflammatory status of the host [27]. Meanwhile, several studies have attempted to explore the prognostic value of AGR in malignant tumors. Our study results were consistent with those reported by Suh et al. who conducted a large retrospec- tive study in generally healthy adults and found that low AGR was a risk factor for cancer morbidity and mortal- ity [16].
