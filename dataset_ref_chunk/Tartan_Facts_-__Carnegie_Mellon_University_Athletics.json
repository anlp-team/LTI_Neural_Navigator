A tartan is often misrepresented as a fierce warrior from either the Asian tundra or Scottish highlands. In actuality, a Tartan is a twilled woolen fabric with a plaid design. It is of Scottish origin and consists of stripes of various colors and widths against a solid ground, denoting a particular family lineage. The school's founder, Andrew Carnegie, was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, in 1835. Carnegie came to the United States in 1848 and founded Carnegie Technical Schools in Pittsburgh in 1900.\n\nThe Scottish terrier mascot performer sports Carnegie tartan attire, while the graphic mascot is wearing a plaid scarf around its neck. So what's the difference between tartan and plaid?\n\nYou'll know it's a tartan if...\n\n\"It's a check or pattern in a variety of colours in woven fabric in which bands of colour are repeated in equal proportion in warp (running lengthwise) and weft (running across).\"\n\n\"Each stripe of the warp crosses every stripe of the weft, so when vertical and horizontal stripes of the same color cross, the result is solid color at the point of intersection.\"\n\n\"The arrangement of colored threads is the same in the warp as in the weft.\"\n\nYou can find our official tartan on various items in the\n\nUniversity Store .\n\nSource: \"Tartan: Romancing the Plaid,\" by Jeffrey Banks and Doria De La Chapelle\n\nOfficial Mascot?\n\nMore than a century after Carnegie Mellon University opened its doors, an official mascot finally made its mark.
