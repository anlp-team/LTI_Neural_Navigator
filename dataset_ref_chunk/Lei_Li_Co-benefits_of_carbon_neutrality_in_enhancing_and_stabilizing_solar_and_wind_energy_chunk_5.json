Although there are large regional differences in changes of solar PVPOT and WP variabilities during 2040\u20132049 under SSP2-4.5, we find that the changes of solar PVPOT and WP variabilities due to global carbon-neutral policies (indicated by the red arrows in Fig. 5) are overall consistent in most of sub-regions focused on here. The day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year variabilities of solar PVPOT decrease in five sub-regions (except for southern South America) during 2040\u20132049 under two carbon-neutral scenarios (MOD and STR) relative to SSP2-4.5.

The six sub-regions are defined in the Fig. 1 caption. on previous studies, our analysis presents a comprehensive global assessment of both solar PV and wind energy, including annual mean power potential as well as temporal stability at various time scales. Our analysis is based on large multi-model ensemble simulations (2400 model years of daily data) that are bias-corrected using a multivariable approach. We estimate the wind speed at 100 m using a spatially variant scaling factor, which is closer to benchmark. The model projections are run under two deep decarbonization scenarios, reaching global carbon neutrality much earlier than previous scenarios. Our findings that climate change mitigation would improve the mean solar PV in Europe, India and China are qualitatively consistent with previous assessments comparing other emission scenarios (for example, RCP2.6 versus 6.0 and RCP4.5 versus 8.5)24,43,44, but with notable magnitude difference. For example, in contrast to decreased solar PV in India at the end of the twenty-first century (2070\u20132100) under RCP2.6 scenario24, we find that the projected decrease in solar PV will rebound to the historical level by the mid-twenty-first century (2040\u20132049) in the STR scenario (Fig. 1d). The north-to-south inter- hemispheric shift of wind energy under SSP2-4.5 relative to the histori- cal period largely agrees with an early study21, but our study highlights a notable west-to-east shift of wind energy due to deep decarbonization.

Although there are large regional differences in changes of solar PVPOT and WP variabilities during 2040\u20132049 under SSP2-4.5, we find that the changes of solar PVPOT and WP variabilities due to global carbon-neutral policies (indicated by the red arrows in Fig. 5) are overall consistent in most of sub-regions focused on here. The day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year variabilities of solar PVPOT decrease in five sub-regions (except for southern South America) during 2040\u20132049 under two carbon-neutral scenarios (MOD and STR) relative to SSP2-4.5. Furthermore, the day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year variabilities of WP decrease in the eastern United States, western Europe, India and eastern China during 2040\u20132049 under two carbon-neutral scenarios of MOD and STR relative to SSP2-4.5, with the exceptions in southern South America and western Africa with less changes (Fig. 5b,d,f). These findings indicate that global carbon-neutral policies improve the temporal stability of daily, monthly and yearly WP and solar PVPOT during 2040\u20132049 in most of global land regions studied here. Discussion Although recent studies have assessed renewable energy resources in response to future climate change20\u201326,43, several knowledge gaps remain to be filled for making sound clean energy policies: (1) many previous analyses focused on high-warming scenarios of RCP8.5 or RCP4.5, but the COVID-19 pandemic may have provided a vital opportunity to accel- erate the renewable transition in coming decades faster than assumed in previous high-warming scenarios; (2) most studies were limited to regional scale or a certain type of renewable energy, while a global analysis is needed to provide an integrated assessment towards building a comprehensive energy supply system; (3) the variability across vari- ous time scales is generally missing in previous regional assessments of renewable energy, despite being known as a major issue strongly affecting the stability and reliability of energy supply; and (4) previous assessments calculated the 100 m wind speed from 10 m wind speed using a constant scaling factor, which thus has probably introduced a large bias in projected wind energy (Supplementary Fig. 5).
