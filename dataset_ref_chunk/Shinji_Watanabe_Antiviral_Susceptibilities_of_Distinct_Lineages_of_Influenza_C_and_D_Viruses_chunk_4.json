The P3 and PB1 gene sequences of the viruses were screened for amino acid substitutions at position 38 in P3 and position 231 in PB1, which corresponds to position 229 in in\ufb02uenza A viruses. None of the in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses tested possessed the P3 38T or PB1 231R substitutions. However, the amino acid at position 38 of in\ufb02uenza D virus P3 was found to be valine, which was recently reported to confer a 3.0- to 3.7-fold increase in IC50 values to baloxavir [9]. 4. Discussion In\ufb02uenza C and D viruses are genetically more closely related to each other than to in\ufb02uenza A or B viruses, suggesting a common ancestor for C and D viruses [35]. In\ufb02uenza C virus was \ufb01rst isolated from humans in 1947 [36] and is widely distributed throughout the world. It infects humans, dogs, swine, camels, horses, and bovines, although humans are the primary host [37]. In\ufb02uenza C virus causes relatively mild respiratory illness; however, it can cause bronchitis and pneumonia, particularly in children younger than 2 years or patients with underlying illnesses [38\u201342]. In\ufb02uenza D virus was \ufb01rst detected in swine in 2011 [23]. Since then, the virus has been detected in bovines in several countries including USA, Mexico, France, Japan, Italy, China, and Ireland [43\u201348]. Global serological studies have shown that in\ufb02uenza D virus has a broad host range, including humans, swine, sheep, goats, camels, horses, and bovines, although the primary host of in\ufb02uenza D virus is bovines [37]. In\ufb02uenza D viruses, as well as in\ufb02uenza C viruses, use 9-O-acetylated sialic acids (Neu5,9Ac2) as the host cell receptor [49] and replicate ef\ufb01ciently in a human well-differentiated respiratory epithelium model (i.e., human airway epithelial cells: hAECs) [50]. In\ufb02uenza D virus genomes have been detected in one (2.3%) of 44 or one (4.2%) of 24 bioaerosol 6 of 10 Viruses 2023, 15, 244 samples from a hospital emergency room [51] and an airport [52], respectively in North Carolina, USA and in one (1.3%) of 78 nasal washes from pig farm workers in Sarawak, Malaysia [53]. Moreover, a high seroprevalence (94\u201397%) of antibodies to in\ufb02uenza D virus was detected among cattle workers in Florida, USA [54]. These observations indicate that in\ufb02uenza D virus has the potential to cause zoonotic infections. Although con\ufb01rmed cases of human infections with in\ufb02uenza D virus have not been reported, the public health risks of this virus should be assessed. At present, there are no antiviral drugs approved for in\ufb02uenza C or D virus infections, although antivirals are widely used for the treatment or prophylaxis of in\ufb02uenza A and B virus infections. Since the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is highly conserved among in\ufb02uenza A, B, C, and D viruses, RNA polymerase inhibitors, such as baloxavir and favipiravir, may be active against in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses. Baloxavir was approved for the treatment of in\ufb02uenza A and B virus infections in Japan and the USA in 2018 and has since been approved in several other countries; favipiravir was approved for in\ufb02uenza pandemic preparedness in Japan in 2014 and stockpiled for use against novel in\ufb02uenza virus infections for which \ufb01rst-line antivirals are ineffective [1]. In\ufb02uenza A viruses are known to be more susceptible to baloxavir than in\ufb02uenza B viruses [3,16,30]. In this study, we found that all in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses tested had IC50 values comparable to or lower than the reference wild-type A and B viruses for baloxavir. These results suggest that baloxavir could be a potential drug for the treatment of in\ufb02uenza C and D virus infections. Clinical data on the ef\ufb01cacy of this drug in patients infected with in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses are needed in the future. Baloxavir acid, an active form of baloxavir marboxil, forms van der Waals interactions with A20, Y24, K34, A37, and I38 in in\ufb02uenza A virus or with T20, F24, M34, N37, and I38 in in\ufb02uenza B virus in the PA endonuclease domain [3]. Although the structure of the P3 endonuclease domain of in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses co-crystalized with baloxavir acid has not been analyzed, amino acid differences at these positions may be related to the lower baloxavir susceptibilities: I20, A24, K34, Q37, and I38 in in\ufb02uenza C virus or I20, V24, T34, S37, and V38 in in\ufb02uenza D virus. In fact, the I38V substitution was recently reported to be associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir [9]. In vitro studies to identify amino acid substitutions associated with RNA inhibitor resistance in in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses may be useful for understanding the differences in IC50 values among in\ufb02uenza A, B, C, and D viruses. The WHO-AVWG has been conducting global analysis of antiviral susceptibilities of circulating in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses since 2012\u20132013 period [9]. To determine the baloxavir and favipiravir susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses, we applied the focus reduction assay we use for our global and nationwide monitoring of the in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses to in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses. Using a combination of this focus reduction assay and a genotypic assay to detect amino acid substitutions associated with antiviral resistance has proven valuable for monitoring the antiviral susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses. Recently, a tentative new lineage of in\ufb02uenza D viruses (the D/Bursa2013 lineage) was detected in cattle in Turkey [55]. Monitoring of the antiviral susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza viruses should continue in order to assess the public health risks posed by these viruses.

The P3 and PB1 gene sequences of the viruses were screened for amino acid substitutions at position 38 in P3 and position 231 in PB1, which corresponds to position 229 in in\ufb02uenza A viruses. None of the in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses tested possessed the P3 38T or PB1 231R substitutions. However, the amino acid at position 38 of in\ufb02uenza D virus P3 was found to be valine, which was recently reported to confer a 3.0- to 3.7-fold increase in IC50 values to baloxavir [9]. 4. Discussion In\ufb02uenza C and D viruses are genetically more closely related to each other than to in\ufb02uenza A or B viruses, suggesting a common ancestor for C and D viruses [35]. In\ufb02uenza C virus was \ufb01rst isolated from humans in 1947 [36] and is widely distributed throughout the world. It infects humans, dogs, swine, camels, horses, and bovines, although humans are the primary host [37]. In\ufb02uenza C virus causes relatively mild respiratory illness; however, it can cause bronchitis and pneumonia, particularly in children younger than 2 years or patients with underlying illnesses [38\u201342]. In\ufb02uenza D virus was \ufb01rst detected in swine in 2011 [23]. Since then, the virus has been detected in bovines in several countries including USA, Mexico, France, Japan, Italy, China, and Ireland [43\u201348]. Global serological studies have shown that in\ufb02uenza D virus has a broad host range, including humans, swine, sheep, goats, camels, horses, and bovines, although the primary host of in\ufb02uenza D virus is bovines [37]. In\ufb02uenza D viruses, as well as in\ufb02uenza C viruses, use 9-O-acetylated sialic acids (Neu5,9Ac2) as the host cell receptor [49] and replicate ef\ufb01ciently in a human well-differentiated respiratory epithelium model (i.e., human airway epithelial cells: hAECs) [50]. In\ufb02uenza D virus genomes have been detected in one (2.3%) of 44 or one (4.2%) of 24 bioaerosol 6 of 10 Viruses 2023, 15, 244 samples from a hospital emergency room [51] and an airport [52], respectively in North Carolina, USA and in one (1.3%) of 78 nasal washes from pig farm workers in Sarawak, Malaysia [53]. Moreover, a high seroprevalence (94\u201397%) of antibodies to in\ufb02uenza D virus was detected among cattle workers in Florida, USA [54]. These observations indicate that in\ufb02uenza D virus has the potential to cause zoonotic infections. Although con\ufb01rmed cases of human infections with in\ufb02uenza D virus have not been reported, the public health risks of this virus should be assessed. At present, there are no antiviral drugs approved for in\ufb02uenza C or D virus infections, although antivirals are widely used for the treatment or prophylaxis of in\ufb02uenza A and B virus infections. Since the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is highly conserved among in\ufb02uenza A, B, C, and D viruses, RNA polymerase inhibitors, such as baloxavir and favipiravir, may be active against in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses. Baloxavir was approved for the treatment of in\ufb02uenza A and B virus infections in Japan and the USA in 2018 and has since been approved in several other countries; favipiravir was approved for in\ufb02uenza pandemic preparedness in Japan in 2014 and stockpiled for use against novel in\ufb02uenza virus infections for which \ufb01rst-line antivirals are ineffective [1]. In\ufb02uenza A viruses are known to be more susceptible to baloxavir than in\ufb02uenza B viruses [3,16,30]. In this study, we found that all in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses tested had IC50 values comparable to or lower than the reference wild-type A and B viruses for baloxavir. These results suggest that baloxavir could be a potential drug for the treatment of in\ufb02uenza C and D virus infections. Clinical data on the ef\ufb01cacy of this drug in patients infected with in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses are needed in the future. Baloxavir acid, an active form of baloxavir marboxil, forms van der Waals interactions with A20, Y24, K34, A37, and I38 in in\ufb02uenza A virus or with T20, F24, M34, N37, and I38 in in\ufb02uenza B virus in the PA endonuclease domain [3]. Although the structure of the P3 endonuclease domain of in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses co-crystalized with baloxavir acid has not been analyzed, amino acid differences at these positions may be related to the lower baloxavir susceptibilities: I20, A24, K34, Q37, and I38 in in\ufb02uenza C virus or I20, V24, T34, S37, and V38 in in\ufb02uenza D virus. In fact, the I38V substitution was recently reported to be associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir [9]. In vitro studies to identify amino acid substitutions associated with RNA inhibitor resistance in in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses may be useful for understanding the differences in IC50 values among in\ufb02uenza A, B, C, and D viruses. The WHO-AVWG has been conducting global analysis of antiviral susceptibilities of circulating in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses since 2012\u20132013 period [9]. To determine the baloxavir and favipiravir susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses, we applied the focus reduction assay we use for our global and nationwide monitoring of the in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses to in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses. Using a combination of this focus reduction assay and a genotypic assay to detect amino acid substitutions associated with antiviral resistance has proven valuable for monitoring the antiviral susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses. Recently, a tentative new lineage of in\ufb02uenza D viruses (the D/Bursa2013 lineage) was detected in cattle in Turkey [55]. Monitoring of the antiviral susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza viruses should continue in order to assess the public health risks posed by these viruses.

The P3 and PB1 gene sequences of the viruses were screened for amino acid substitutions at position 38 in P3 and position 231 in PB1, which corresponds to position 229 in in\ufb02uenza A viruses. None of the in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses tested possessed the P3 38T or PB1 231R substitutions. However, the amino acid at position 38 of in\ufb02uenza D virus P3 was found to be valine, which was recently reported to confer a 3.0- to 3.7-fold increase in IC50 values to baloxavir [9]. 4. Discussion In\ufb02uenza C and D viruses are genetically more closely related to each other than to in\ufb02uenza A or B viruses, suggesting a common ancestor for C and D viruses [35]. In\ufb02uenza C virus was \ufb01rst isolated from humans in 1947 [36] and is widely distributed throughout the world. It infects humans, dogs, swine, camels, horses, and bovines, although humans are the primary host [37]. In\ufb02uenza C virus causes relatively mild respiratory illness; however, it can cause bronchitis and pneumonia, particularly in children younger than 2 years or patients with underlying illnesses [38\u201342]. In\ufb02uenza D virus was \ufb01rst detected in swine in 2011 [23]. Since then, the virus has been detected in bovines in several countries including USA, Mexico, France, Japan, Italy, China, and Ireland [43\u201348]. Global serological studies have shown that in\ufb02uenza D virus has a broad host range, including humans, swine, sheep, goats, camels, horses, and bovines, although the primary host of in\ufb02uenza D virus is bovines [37]. In\ufb02uenza D viruses, as well as in\ufb02uenza C viruses, use 9-O-acetylated sialic acids (Neu5,9Ac2) as the host cell receptor [49] and replicate ef\ufb01ciently in a human well-differentiated respiratory epithelium model (i.e., human airway epithelial cells: hAECs) [50]. In\ufb02uenza D virus genomes have been detected in one (2.3%) of 44 or one (4.2%) of 24 bioaerosol 6 of 10 Viruses 2023, 15, 244 samples from a hospital emergency room [51] and an airport [52], respectively in North Carolina, USA and in one (1.3%) of 78 nasal washes from pig farm workers in Sarawak, Malaysia [53]. Moreover, a high seroprevalence (94\u201397%) of antibodies to in\ufb02uenza D virus was detected among cattle workers in Florida, USA [54]. These observations indicate that in\ufb02uenza D virus has the potential to cause zoonotic infections. Although con\ufb01rmed cases of human infections with in\ufb02uenza D virus have not been reported, the public health risks of this virus should be assessed. At present, there are no antiviral drugs approved for in\ufb02uenza C or D virus infections, although antivirals are widely used for the treatment or prophylaxis of in\ufb02uenza A and B virus infections. Since the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is highly conserved among in\ufb02uenza A, B, C, and D viruses, RNA polymerase inhibitors, such as baloxavir and favipiravir, may be active against in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses. Baloxavir was approved for the treatment of in\ufb02uenza A and B virus infections in Japan and the USA in 2018 and has since been approved in several other countries; favipiravir was approved for in\ufb02uenza pandemic preparedness in Japan in 2014 and stockpiled for use against novel in\ufb02uenza virus infections for which \ufb01rst-line antivirals are ineffective [1]. In\ufb02uenza A viruses are known to be more susceptible to baloxavir than in\ufb02uenza B viruses [3,16,30]. In this study, we found that all in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses tested had IC50 values comparable to or lower than the reference wild-type A and B viruses for baloxavir. These results suggest that baloxavir could be a potential drug for the treatment of in\ufb02uenza C and D virus infections. Clinical data on the ef\ufb01cacy of this drug in patients infected with in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses are needed in the future. Baloxavir acid, an active form of baloxavir marboxil, forms van der Waals interactions with A20, Y24, K34, A37, and I38 in in\ufb02uenza A virus or with T20, F24, M34, N37, and I38 in in\ufb02uenza B virus in the PA endonuclease domain [3]. Although the structure of the P3 endonuclease domain of in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses co-crystalized with baloxavir acid has not been analyzed, amino acid differences at these positions may be related to the lower baloxavir susceptibilities: I20, A24, K34, Q37, and I38 in in\ufb02uenza C virus or I20, V24, T34, S37, and V38 in in\ufb02uenza D virus. In fact, the I38V substitution was recently reported to be associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir [9]. In vitro studies to identify amino acid substitutions associated with RNA inhibitor resistance in in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses may be useful for understanding the differences in IC50 values among in\ufb02uenza A, B, C, and D viruses. The WHO-AVWG has been conducting global analysis of antiviral susceptibilities of circulating in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses since 2012\u20132013 period [9]. To determine the baloxavir and favipiravir susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses, we applied the focus reduction assay we use for our global and nationwide monitoring of the in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses to in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses. Using a combination of this focus reduction assay and a genotypic assay to detect amino acid substitutions associated with antiviral resistance has proven valuable for monitoring the antiviral susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses. Recently, a tentative new lineage of in\ufb02uenza D viruses (the D/Bursa2013 lineage) was detected in cattle in Turkey [55]. Monitoring of the antiviral susceptibilities of in\ufb02uenza viruses should continue in order to assess the public health risks posed by these viruses.
