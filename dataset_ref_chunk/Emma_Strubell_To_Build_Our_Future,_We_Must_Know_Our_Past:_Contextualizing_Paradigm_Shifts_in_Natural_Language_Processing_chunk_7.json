Additionally, considering that West- ern institutions constitute a citation network largely distinct from Asian networks (Rungta et al., 2022), we believe that our sample allows us to tell a rich and thorough story of factors which have shaped the Western NLP research community, which both informs and is informed by other communities of NLP researchers.

Additionally, considering that West- ern institutions constitute a citation network largely distinct from Asian networks (Rungta et al., 2022), we believe that our sample allows us to tell a rich and thorough story of factors which have shaped the Western NLP research community, which both informs and is informed by other communities of NLP researchers.

In general, although we gathered perspectives from participants across a variety of demographic backgrounds, our partic- ipants represent those who have been successful and persisted in the field.
