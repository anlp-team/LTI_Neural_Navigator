Appendix A The following is a brief description of various VFO models: Two-mass models: Two-mass models describe vocal fold motion as two coupled mass-damper-spring os- cillators: M1 \u00a8x1 + B1 \u02d9x1 + K(x1 \u2212 x2) + R1 = F1 M2 \u00a8x2 + B2 \u02d9x2 + K(x2 \u2212 x1) + R2 = F2 where xi, Mi, Bi are the i-th oscillator\u2019s displacement, mass, and viscous damping coef\ufb01cient, K is the coupling stiffness between the two masses, Fi is the driving force, and Ri is the elastic restoring force [15]. This model assumes (1) small air inertia and quasi-steady glottal \ufb02ow, (2) negligible supra-glottal pressure, and (3) that the nonlinearity induced by vocal fold collision is small. These assumptions lead to small-amplitude oscillations and model simpli\ufb01cation. Multi-mass models: Multi-mass models have a greater degrees of freedom and hence can model vocal fold motion with high precision. They are based on mass-spring-damper motion dynamics which are widely used in multiple problem settings (e.g., [42]). For the i-th mass component, the equation of motion is: Mi \u00a8xi = F A i + FV i + F L i + FC i + F D i where xi = (xi, yi, zi) is the three-dimensional displacement, Mi is the mass, F A is i the anchor force associated with the anchor spring and damper, FV i are the vertical and longitudinal coupling forces associated with spring and damping, FC i is the collision restoring force, and F D is the driving force from glottal pressure [18]. i In [18], 50 masses are used. Finite element models: Finite element models discretize the vocal fold motion in space and time\u2014the geome- try of the vocal fold is discretized into small elements (cells). In each cell, the applicable differential equation governed by the law of physics is solved. These models can handle complex geometries, continuous deformation, and complex driving forces [17]. i and F L 20 of 39 (A1) (A2) (A3) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Consider a cube element with six stress and strain components. By the principles of elasticity in mechanics we have: \u03c3 = S(cid:101) where \u03c3 is the stress tensor, (cid:101) is the strain tensor, and S is the stiffness matrix consisting of Young\u2019s modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson\u2019s ratio [17]. The relation between stress and displacement is governed by: \u2202u \u2202x \u2202u \u03c3z = C2\u00b5 \u2202x \u03c4xy = \u00b5(cid:48) \u2202u \u2202y \u03c4yz = \u00b5(cid:48) \u2202w \u2202y (cid:18) \u2202w \u2202x \u03c3x = C1\u00b5 \u03c4zx = \u00b5 + C2\u00b5 + C1\u00b5 \u2202w \u2202z \u2202w \u2202z + \u2202u \u2202z (cid:19) where \u03c4 is the shear stress, u and w are the lateral and vertical components of the displacement vector, \u00b5 and \u00b5(cid:48) are shear moduli, and C1 and C2 are constants [17]. This system of partial differential equations can be ef\ufb01ciently solved by \ufb01nite element meth- ods. The following is a brief description of various VT models: Bio-mechanical models: Bio-mechanical models simulate the geometry and articulatory movements of the vocal tract using displacement-based \ufb01nite element methods and take into account the continuous tissue deformation and variation of the physiological, bio-mechanical, and visco-elastic properties of muscles [27]. They are more scalable and accurate, and allow for the modeling of more \ufb01ne-grained control over muscular forces, articu- lator positions, and movements. Statistical models: These model the vocal tract as statistical factors or components. For instance, factor analysis describes the vocal tract pro\ufb01le as a sum of articulatory components and analyzes the relationship between individual, or a combination of, components and vocal tract parameters [25]. Geometric models: These attempt to depict the shape and geometric con\ufb01gurations of the vocal tract. They specify articulatory state with vocal tract parameters that de\ufb01ne the position and shape of tongue, lips, jaw, larynx, etc. [26]. However, such models are not scalable because they do not account for the continuous variations of the anatomy and articulatory state, require clinical measurements such as from magnetic resonance imaging, and are not amendable to coupling with vocal fold models.

Appendix A The following is a brief description of various VFO models: Two-mass models: Two-mass models describe vocal fold motion as two coupled mass-damper-spring os- cillators: M1 \u00a8x1 + B1 \u02d9x1 + K(x1 \u2212 x2) + R1 = F1 M2 \u00a8x2 + B2 \u02d9x2 + K(x2 \u2212 x1) + R2 = F2 where xi, Mi, Bi are the i-th oscillator\u2019s displacement, mass, and viscous damping coef\ufb01cient, K is the coupling stiffness between the two masses, Fi is the driving force, and Ri is the elastic restoring force [15]. This model assumes (1) small air inertia and quasi-steady glottal \ufb02ow, (2) negligible supra-glottal pressure, and (3) that the nonlinearity induced by vocal fold collision is small. These assumptions lead to small-amplitude oscillations and model simpli\ufb01cation. Multi-mass models: Multi-mass models have a greater degrees of freedom and hence can model vocal fold motion with high precision. They are based on mass-spring-damper motion dynamics which are widely used in multiple problem settings (e.g., [42]). For the i-th mass component, the equation of motion is: Mi \u00a8xi = F A i + FV i + F L i + FC i + F D i where xi = (xi, yi, zi) is the three-dimensional displacement, Mi is the mass, F A is i the anchor force associated with the anchor spring and damper, FV i are the vertical and longitudinal coupling forces associated with spring and damping, FC i is the collision restoring force, and F D is the driving force from glottal pressure [18]. i In [18], 50 masses are used. Finite element models: Finite element models discretize the vocal fold motion in space and time\u2014the geome- try of the vocal fold is discretized into small elements (cells). In each cell, the applicable differential equation governed by the law of physics is solved. These models can handle complex geometries, continuous deformation, and complex driving forces [17]. i and F L 20 of 39 (A1) (A2) (A3) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Consider a cube element with six stress and strain components. By the principles of elasticity in mechanics we have: \u03c3 = S(cid:101) where \u03c3 is the stress tensor, (cid:101) is the strain tensor, and S is the stiffness matrix consisting of Young\u2019s modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson\u2019s ratio [17]. The relation between stress and displacement is governed by: \u2202u \u2202x \u2202u \u03c3z = C2\u00b5 \u2202x \u03c4xy = \u00b5(cid:48) \u2202u \u2202y \u03c4yz = \u00b5(cid:48) \u2202w \u2202y (cid:18) \u2202w \u2202x \u03c3x = C1\u00b5 \u03c4zx = \u00b5 + C2\u00b5 + C1\u00b5 \u2202w \u2202z \u2202w \u2202z + \u2202u \u2202z (cid:19) where \u03c4 is the shear stress, u and w are the lateral and vertical components of the displacement vector, \u00b5 and \u00b5(cid:48) are shear moduli, and C1 and C2 are constants [17]. This system of partial differential equations can be ef\ufb01ciently solved by \ufb01nite element meth- ods. The following is a brief description of various VT models: Bio-mechanical models: Bio-mechanical models simulate the geometry and articulatory movements of the vocal tract using displacement-based \ufb01nite element methods and take into account the continuous tissue deformation and variation of the physiological, bio-mechanical, and visco-elastic properties of muscles [27]. They are more scalable and accurate, and allow for the modeling of more \ufb01ne-grained control over muscular forces, articu- lator positions, and movements. Statistical models: These model the vocal tract as statistical factors or components. For instance, factor analysis describes the vocal tract pro\ufb01le as a sum of articulatory components and analyzes the relationship between individual, or a combination of, components and vocal tract parameters [25]. Geometric models: These attempt to depict the shape and geometric con\ufb01gurations of the vocal tract. They specify articulatory state with vocal tract parameters that de\ufb01ne the position and shape of tongue, lips, jaw, larynx, etc. [26]. However, such models are not scalable because they do not account for the continuous variations of the anatomy and articulatory state, require clinical measurements such as from magnetic resonance imaging, and are not amendable to coupling with vocal fold models.

These assumptions lead to small-amplitude oscillations and model simpli\ufb01cation. Multi-mass models: Multi-mass models have a greater degrees of freedom and hence can model vocal fold motion with high precision. They are based on mass-spring-damper motion dynamics which are widely used in multiple problem settings (e.g., [42]). For the i-th mass component, the equation of motion is: Mi \u00a8xi = F A i + FV i + F L i + FC i + F D i where xi = (xi, yi, zi) is the three-dimensional displacement, Mi is the mass, F A is i the anchor force associated with the anchor spring and damper, FV i are the vertical and longitudinal coupling forces associated with spring and damping, FC i is the collision restoring force, and F D is the driving force from glottal pressure [18]. i In [18], 50 masses are used. Finite element models: Finite element models discretize the vocal fold motion in space and time\u2014the geome- try of the vocal fold is discretized into small elements (cells). In each cell, the applicable differential equation governed by the law of physics is solved. These models can handle complex geometries, continuous deformation, and complex driving forces [17]. i and F L 20 of 39 (A1) (A2) (A3) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Consider a cube element with six stress and strain components. By the principles of elasticity in mechanics we have: \u03c3 = S(cid:101) where \u03c3 is the stress tensor, (cid:101) is the strain tensor, and S is the stiffness matrix consisting of Young\u2019s modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson\u2019s ratio [17]. The relation between stress and displacement is governed by: \u2202u \u2202x \u2202u \u03c3z = C2\u00b5 \u2202x \u03c4xy = \u00b5(cid:48) \u2202u \u2202y \u03c4yz = \u00b5(cid:48) \u2202w \u2202y (cid:18) \u2202w \u2202x \u03c3x = C1\u00b5 \u03c4zx = \u00b5 + C2\u00b5 + C1\u00b5 \u2202w \u2202z \u2202w \u2202z + \u2202u \u2202z (cid:19) where \u03c4 is the shear stress, u and w are the lateral and vertical components of the displacement vector, \u00b5 and \u00b5(cid:48) are shear moduli, and C1 and C2 are constants [17]. This system of partial differential equations can be ef\ufb01ciently solved by \ufb01nite element meth- ods. The following is a brief description of various VT models: Bio-mechanical models: Bio-mechanical models simulate the geometry and articulatory movements of the vocal tract using displacement-based \ufb01nite element methods and take into account the continuous tissue deformation and variation of the physiological, bio-mechanical, and visco-elastic properties of muscles [27]. They are more scalable and accurate, and allow for the modeling of more \ufb01ne-grained control over muscular forces, articu- lator positions, and movements. Statistical models: These model the vocal tract as statistical factors or components. For instance, factor analysis describes the vocal tract pro\ufb01le as a sum of articulatory components and analyzes the relationship between individual, or a combination of, components and vocal tract parameters [25]. Geometric models: These attempt to depict the shape and geometric con\ufb01gurations of the vocal tract. They specify articulatory state with vocal tract parameters that de\ufb01ne the position and shape of tongue, lips, jaw, larynx, etc. [26]. However, such models are not scalable because they do not account for the continuous variations of the anatomy and articulatory state, require clinical measurements such as from magnetic resonance imaging, and are not amendable to coupling with vocal fold models.
