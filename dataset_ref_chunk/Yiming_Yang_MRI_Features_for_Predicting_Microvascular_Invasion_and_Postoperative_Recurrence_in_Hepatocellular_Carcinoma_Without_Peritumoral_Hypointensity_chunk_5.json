Our finding that corona enhancement and peritumoral HBP hypointensity are independent predictors of MVI is consistent with reports by Lee et al and Zhang et al15,18 For MVI-positive HCCs, local tumor invasion or infiltration of tumor cells into vessels could impair the function of peritumoral hepatocytes, which would result in impaired OATP transporter expression and decreased uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA in the peritumoral region, that is, peritumoral HBP hypointensity.19 However, when infiltration of tumor cells in vessels is limited, impairment of OATP transporter function is also limited, as is the likelihood of peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Furthermore, HCCs with coactivation of Wnt/\u03b2- catenin signaling and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 could induce higher OATP expression and manifest as peritumoral HBP hyperenhancement.20 Therefore, peritumoral HBP hypointensity would be a good indicator for ruling in MVI rather than ruling it out. Our finding that the sensitivity of peritumoral HBP hypointensity in identifying MVI was quite low (23.80%) supports this theory.

After removal of patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity, there was a marked decrease in the proportion of patients with MVI-positive HCC without a radiological capsule.

This is consistent with our finding that the presence of a radiological capsule has a relatively high NPV for predicting MVI-positive HCC in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Peritumoral HBP hypointensity in HCC is not only associated with an increased risk of MVI but is also an established adverse prognostic liver transplantation.19,25 In our study, intrahepatic RFS was significantly shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypoin- tensity than in patients without this feature. However, given the relatively low frequency of peritumoral HBP hypoin- tensity, it is necessary to explore other supplementary MRI features that could predict postoperative recurrence. Our study demonstrated that satellite nodule was an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the risk of tumor recurrence in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. The effect of satellite nodule on tumor recurrence has been demonstrated in previous studies. Mul\u00e9 et al found that satellite nodule was independently associated with both early and overall tumor recurrence.26 Similarly, Kim et al identified the presence of satellite nodule and peritumoral HBP hypointensity as independent factors associated with tumor recurrence after liver transplantation.27 These studies strongly support our findings. Moreover, intrahepatic RFS was comparable between patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity and those with satellite nodule but without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Therefore, we established a two-step flowchart based on MRI features for the prediction of early hepatic recurrence, which showed good performance in risk assessment. imaging feature for early tumor recurrence after curative hepatic resection and Interobserver variability is a major concern in terms of the reliability of the features seen on preoperative MRI images when used as a decision-making tool. In our study, the two radiologists yielded moderate to excellent agreement (\u03ba=0.431\u20130.885) for MRI features of HCC, which is similar to the results reported by Lee et al (\u03ba 0.64\u20130.88).28 However, Min et al and Kim et al reported relatively lower \u03ba values (0.38\u20130.47 and 0.53\u20130.59, respectively).27,29 The good interobserver agreement in our study might be attributed to the discussion and case training on MRI features prior to formal assessment. This study has several limitations. First, it had a single-center retrospective design and small sample size; therefore, there is a possibility of selection bias. Therefore, the results require confirmation in a larger multicenter prospective study. Second, the follow-up duration was relatively short and a proportion of patients were lost to follow-up, which may have diminished the strength of our results. However, most early intrahepatic HCCs occurred in the first year, similar to our data. Third, the main etiology of liver disease in our study was chronic hepatitis, particularly chronic hepatitis B. Further investigations in populations with different underlying causes are required. Conclusion In conclusion, we found peritumoral HBP hypointensity to be an important MRI feature for identifying MVI status and early intrahepatic recurrence but with low sensitivity. In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the presence of a radiological capsule may be useful for identifying the MVI status, whereas satellite nodule may be an independent risk factor for shorter intrahepatic RFS.

In our study, the two radiologists yielded moderate to excellent agreement (\u03ba=0.431\u20130.885) for MRI features of HCC, which is similar to the results reported by Lee et al (\u03ba 0.64\u20130.88).28 However, Min et al and Kim et al reported relatively lower \u03ba values (0.38\u20130.47 and 0.53\u20130.59, respectively).27,29 The good interobserver agreement in our study might be attributed to the discussion and case training on MRI features prior to formal assessment. This study has several limitations. First, it had a single-center retrospective design and small sample size; therefore, there is a possibility of selection bias. Therefore, the results require confirmation in a larger multicenter prospective study. Second, the follow-up duration was relatively short and a proportion of patients were lost to follow-up, which may have diminished the strength of our results. However, most early intrahepatic HCCs occurred in the first year, similar to our data. Third, the main etiology of liver disease in our study was chronic hepatitis, particularly chronic hepatitis B. Further investigations in populations with different underlying causes are required. Conclusion In conclusion, we found peritumoral HBP hypointensity to be an important MRI feature for identifying MVI status and early intrahepatic recurrence but with low sensitivity. In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the presence of a radiological capsule may be useful for identifying the MVI status, whereas satellite nodule may be an independent risk factor for shorter intrahepatic RFS. The use of our two stepwise flowchart that incorporates peritumoral HBP hypoin- tensity and satellite nodule could significantly improve the detection rate of high-risk HCC, which could assist clinicians in treatment decision-making.

This is consistent with our finding that the presence of a radiological capsule has a relatively high NPV for predicting MVI-positive HCC in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Peritumoral HBP hypointensity in HCC is not only associated with an increased risk of MVI but is also an established adverse prognostic liver transplantation.19,25 In our study, intrahepatic RFS was significantly shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypoin- tensity than in patients without this feature. However, given the relatively low frequency of peritumoral HBP hypoin- tensity, it is necessary to explore other supplementary MRI features that could predict postoperative recurrence.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the risk of tumor recurrence in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. The effect of satellite nodule on tumor recurrence has been demonstrated in previous studies.

Peritumoral HBP hypointensity in HCC is not only associated with an increased risk of MVI but is also an established adverse prognostic liver transplantation.19,25 In our study, intrahepatic RFS was significantly shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypoin- tensity than in patients without this feature. However, given the relatively low frequency of peritumoral HBP hypoin- tensity, it is necessary to explore other supplementary MRI features that could predict postoperative recurrence. Our study demonstrated that satellite nodule was an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the risk of tumor recurrence in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. The effect of satellite nodule on tumor recurrence has been demonstrated in previous studies. Mul\u00e9 et al found that satellite nodule was independently associated with both early and overall tumor recurrence.26 Similarly, Kim et al identified the presence of satellite nodule and peritumoral HBP hypointensity as independent factors associated with tumor recurrence after liver transplantation.27 These studies strongly support our findings. Moreover, intrahepatic RFS was comparable between patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity and those with satellite nodule but without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Therefore, we established a two-step flowchart based on MRI features for the prediction of early hepatic recurrence, which showed good performance in risk assessment. imaging feature for early tumor recurrence after curative hepatic resection and Interobserver variability is a major concern in terms of the reliability of the features seen on preoperative MRI images when used as a decision-making tool. In our study, the two radiologists yielded moderate to excellent agreement (\u03ba=0.431\u20130.885) for MRI features of HCC, which is similar to the results reported by Lee et al (\u03ba 0.64\u20130.88).28 However, Min et al and Kim et al reported relatively lower \u03ba values (0.38\u20130.47 and 0.53\u20130.59, respectively).27,29 The good interobserver agreement in our study might be attributed to the discussion and case training on MRI features prior to formal assessment. This study has several limitations. First, it had a single-center retrospective design and small sample size; therefore, there is a possibility of selection bias. Therefore, the results require confirmation in a larger multicenter prospective study. Second, the follow-up duration was relatively short and a proportion of patients were lost to follow-up, which may have diminished the strength of our results. However, most early intrahepatic HCCs occurred in the first year, similar to our data. Third, the main etiology of liver disease in our study was chronic hepatitis, particularly chronic hepatitis B. Further investigations in populations with different underlying causes are required. Conclusion In conclusion, we found peritumoral HBP hypointensity to be an important MRI feature for identifying MVI status and early intrahepatic recurrence but with low sensitivity. In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the presence of a radiological capsule may be useful for identifying the MVI status, whereas satellite nodule may be an independent risk factor for shorter intrahepatic RFS. The use of our two stepwise flowchart that incorporates peritumoral HBP hypoin- tensity and satellite nodule could significantly improve the detection rate of high-risk HCC, which could assist clinicians in treatment decision-making.

Recurrence-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with high-risk hepatocellular carcinoma than in those with low-risk hepatocellular carcinoma (hazard ratio 3.511, 95% confidence interval 1.995\u20136.181, P<0.001). evaluated preoperatively found that the rate of early recurrence was lower after surgical resection than after radio- frequency ablation and that anatomical resection was superior to nonanatomical resection.14\u201317 Therefore, the develop- ment of noninvasive methods for preoperative prediction of MVI status has become an important research topic in recent years. The features of HCC observed on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI were confirmed to be associated with MVI status. Our finding that corona enhancement and peritumoral HBP hypointensity are independent predictors of MVI is consistent with reports by Lee et al and Zhang et al15,18 For MVI-positive HCCs, local tumor invasion or infiltration of tumor cells into vessels could impair the function of peritumoral hepatocytes, which would result in impaired OATP transporter expression and decreased uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA in the peritumoral region, that is, peritumoral HBP hypointensity.19 However, when infiltration of tumor cells in vessels is limited, impairment of OATP transporter function is also limited, as is the likelihood of peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Furthermore, HCCs with coactivation of Wnt/\u03b2- catenin signaling and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 could induce higher OATP expression and manifest as peritumoral HBP hyperenhancement.20 Therefore, peritumoral HBP hypointensity would be a good indicator for ruling in MVI rather than ruling it out. Our finding that the sensitivity of peritumoral HBP hypointensity in identifying MVI was quite low (23.80%) supports this theory. Almost three-quarters of the MVI-positive HCCs were missed when using this feature alone. Therefore, there is a need to explore other MRI features to identify MVI-positive HCC in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. The presence of a radiological capsule is a MRI characteristic that has been controversial in terms of predicting MVI status. Some studies have found that it is a valuable predictor of MVI-positive HCC, while others have not.21\u201324 Interestingly, in our study, a radiological capsule could predict MVI in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, but not in the overall study cohort. A possible explanation for this finding is that peritumoral HBP hypointensity was significantly more common in patients with MVI-positive HCC than in MVI-negative HCC in those patients without a radiological capsule (50.0% vs 5.8%, P=0.015). After removal of patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity, there was a marked decrease in the proportion of patients with MVI-positive HCC without a radiological capsule. Therefore, the absence of a tumor capsule in this subgroup strongly indicates MVI-negative status and could be used as a rule-out Journal of Hepatocellular Carcinoma 2023:10 https://doi.org/10.2147/JHC.S422632 1605 DovePress Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Chen et al Dovepress indicator.
