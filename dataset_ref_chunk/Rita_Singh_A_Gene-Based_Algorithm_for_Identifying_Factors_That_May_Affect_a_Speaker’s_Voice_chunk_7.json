Inferences A wealth of conclusions can be drawn from Table 1 (and from its more detailed version, Table A1 in Appendix A). However, we focus only on those that help validate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm. 4.1. Voice Chains as Predictors of Speech Characteristics Of the 76 syndromes in Table A1, voice chains were found to exist for all. By our hypothesis, this would imply that in all cases, there is a potential for voice to be affected. The syndromes 15q11\u2013q13 and Xq28 have two versions each, divided in the medical literature based on symptoms, rather than gene composition of the microdeletion region. We can therefore combine them for analysis, leaving us with 74 syndromes to be analyzed. For the syndrome 16q22, no information about the speech issues was found in the medical literature. Only the remaining 73 syndromes are considered in the analysis below. Entropy 2023, 25, 897 The incidence of speech pathologies (including all forms of pathologies) among the general population is reported to be about 5% [65], and between 2.3% and 24.6% among children [66]. Of the 73 syndromes, 17 syndromes had both level-1 and level-2 voice chains, while 56 had only level-2 chains. The occurrence of speech aberrations was reported for all 17 syndromes with level-1 chains and for all but 6 of the 56 syndromes with only level-2 voice chains. Thus, voice chains correlate highly with the existence of speech anomalies. 4.2. Voice Chains as Information-Carrying Entities Let us study how voice chains correlate with the presence or absence of speci\ufb01c voice problems. Such correlations would show that voice chains carry information about how the voice may be affected. This information is expected to be coarse-grained since we only take the presence or absence of any gene into consideration and consider no other cytogenetic information related to it. From Table A1, we observe the following. Level-1 chains: The number of level-1 chainlink genes is limited to 1 or 2 in all cases and is not amenable to statistical analysis. However, we make the following observations: 1. 2. 3. Level-1 voice chains co-occur with speech problems 100% of the time. For all instances where level-1 voice chains are present, severe symptoms occur 100% of the time (impaired, delayed or absent speech). For all instances of syndromes with no effect on speech (i.e., where normal is not just one of a range of other speech symptoms), level-1 chains are absent 100% of the the time. Level-2 Chains: Level-2 voice chains are present in all cases and co-occur with speech disorders in all but 6 cases; thus, in only 6 cases has speech been reported to be normal. Therefore, level-2 voice chains co-occur with speech problems 91.8% of the time. We note that a syndrome may have level-2 voice chains through many chainlink genes, which could number in the tens or even hundreds. Each of the chainlink genes could, in turn, also be associated with multiple other pathways, in addition to the one connecting it to FOXP2. We refer to the total number of pathways that include the chainlink genes of a syndrome as its \u201cchainlink connectivity\u201d. Table 2 presents some statistics of syndromes, chainlink genes, and chainlink connec- tivity associated with speech disorders of different severity.The problems considered are: absent speech (the most severe symptom), impaired speech (a symptom that is less severe than absent), delayed speech (a cognitive symptom that is also less severe than absent and comparable in severity to impaired speech\u2014a physical symptom), dysarthric speech (a symptom related to physical issues), and apraxic speech (due to CNS disorders; this is less severe compared to absent speech and often subsumes idiosyncratic speech). Each row of the table represents one type of speech problem and shows the number of syndromes associated with it, the mean and median of the counts of chainlink genes for the syndromes, and the mean and median of the chainlink connectivities of the syndromes. From an inspection of Table 2, a distinct pattern emerges. Rank ordering the symptoms by ascending order of the means of the counts of chainlink genes, we see that their connectivities also fall in almost the same order: normal(32, 404) < apraxia(43, 675) < dysarthria(43, 725) < impaired(46, 734) < delayed(47, 682) < absent(60, 902) This rank ordering is consistent with the rank ordering of symptom severity based on the descriptions in the medical literature. In general, statistically speaking, the number of chainlink genes and the chainlink connectivity both appear to relate monotonically to the severity of the speech disorder. 13 of 33 (1) Entropy 2023, 25, 897 Table 2.

In particular, as is evident from Figure 3c, the distribution for normal speech stands out distinctly, as does that for absent speech, although the latter is not as distinctive as the former.

Rank ordering the symptoms by ascending order of the means of the counts of chainlink genes, we see that their connectivities also fall in almost the same order: normal(32, 404) < apraxia(43, 675) < dysarthria(43, 725) < impaired(46, 734) < delayed(47, 682) < absent(60, 902) This rank ordering is consistent with the rank ordering of symptom severity based on the descriptions in the medical literature. In general, statistically speaking, the number of chainlink genes and the chainlink connectivity both appear to relate monotonically to the severity of the speech disorder. 13 of 33 (1) Entropy 2023, 25, 897 Table 2.

However, we focus only on those that help validate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm. 4.1. Voice Chains as Predictors of Speech Characteristics Of the 76 syndromes in Table A1, voice chains were found to exist for all. By our hypothesis, this would imply that in all cases, there is a potential for voice to be affected. The syndromes 15q11\u2013q13 and Xq28 have two versions each, divided in the medical literature based on symptoms, rather than gene composition of the microdeletion region. We can therefore combine them for analysis, leaving us with 74 syndromes to be analyzed. For the syndrome 16q22, no information about the speech issues was found in the medical literature. Only the remaining 73 syndromes are considered in the analysis below. Entropy 2023, 25, 897 The incidence of speech pathologies (including all forms of pathologies) among the general population is reported to be about 5% [65], and between 2.3% and 24.6% among children [66]. Of the 73 syndromes, 17 syndromes had both level-1 and level-2 voice chains, while 56 had only level-2 chains. The occurrence of speech aberrations was reported for all 17 syndromes with level-1 chains and for all but 6 of the 56 syndromes with only level-2 voice chains. Thus, voice chains correlate highly with the existence of speech anomalies. 4.2. Voice Chains as Information-Carrying Entities Let us study how voice chains correlate with the presence or absence of speci\ufb01c voice problems. Such correlations would show that voice chains carry information about how the voice may be affected. This information is expected to be coarse-grained since we only take the presence or absence of any gene into consideration and consider no other cytogenetic information related to it. From Table A1, we observe the following. Level-1 chains: The number of level-1 chainlink genes is limited to 1 or 2 in all cases and is not amenable to statistical analysis. However, we make the following observations: 1. 2. 3. Level-1 voice chains co-occur with speech problems 100% of the time. For all instances where level-1 voice chains are present, severe symptoms occur 100% of the time (impaired, delayed or absent speech). For all instances of syndromes with no effect on speech (i.e., where normal is not just one of a range of other speech symptoms), level-1 chains are absent 100% of the the time. Level-2 Chains: Level-2 voice chains are present in all cases and co-occur with speech disorders in all but 6 cases; thus, in only 6 cases has speech been reported to be normal. Therefore, level-2 voice chains co-occur with speech problems 91.8% of the time. We note that a syndrome may have level-2 voice chains through many chainlink genes, which could number in the tens or even hundreds. Each of the chainlink genes could, in turn, also be associated with multiple other pathways, in addition to the one connecting it to FOXP2. We refer to the total number of pathways that include the chainlink genes of a syndrome as its \u201cchainlink connectivity\u201d. Table 2 presents some statistics of syndromes, chainlink genes, and chainlink connec- tivity associated with speech disorders of different severity.The problems considered are: absent speech (the most severe symptom), impaired speech (a symptom that is less severe than absent), delayed speech (a cognitive symptom that is also less severe than absent and comparable in severity to impaired speech\u2014a physical symptom), dysarthric speech (a symptom related to physical issues), and apraxic speech (due to CNS disorders; this is less severe compared to absent speech and often subsumes idiosyncratic speech). Each row of the table represents one type of speech problem and shows the number of syndromes associated with it, the mean and median of the counts of chainlink genes for the syndromes, and the mean and median of the chainlink connectivities of the syndromes. From an inspection of Table 2, a distinct pattern emerges.

However, we make the following observations: 1. 2. 3. Level-1 voice chains co-occur with speech problems 100% of the time. For all instances where level-1 voice chains are present, severe symptoms occur 100% of the time (impaired, delayed or absent speech). For all instances of syndromes with no effect on speech (i.e., where normal is not just one of a range of other speech symptoms), level-1 chains are absent 100% of the the time. Level-2 Chains: Level-2 voice chains are present in all cases and co-occur with speech disorders in all but 6 cases; thus, in only 6 cases has speech been reported to be normal. Therefore, level-2 voice chains co-occur with speech problems 91.8% of the time. We note that a syndrome may have level-2 voice chains through many chainlink genes, which could number in the tens or even hundreds. Each of the chainlink genes could, in turn, also be associated with multiple other pathways, in addition to the one connecting it to FOXP2. We refer to the total number of pathways that include the chainlink genes of a syndrome as its \u201cchainlink connectivity\u201d. Table 2 presents some statistics of syndromes, chainlink genes, and chainlink connec- tivity associated with speech disorders of different severity.The problems considered are: absent speech (the most severe symptom), impaired speech (a symptom that is less severe than absent), delayed speech (a cognitive symptom that is also less severe than absent and comparable in severity to impaired speech\u2014a physical symptom), dysarthric speech (a symptom related to physical issues), and apraxic speech (due to CNS disorders; this is less severe compared to absent speech and often subsumes idiosyncratic speech). Each row of the table represents one type of speech problem and shows the number of syndromes associated with it, the mean and median of the counts of chainlink genes for the syndromes, and the mean and median of the chainlink connectivities of the syndromes. From an inspection of Table 2, a distinct pattern emerges. Rank ordering the symptoms by ascending order of the means of the counts of chainlink genes, we see that their connectivities also fall in almost the same order: normal(32, 404) < apraxia(43, 675) < dysarthria(43, 725) < impaired(46, 734) < delayed(47, 682) < absent(60, 902) This rank ordering is consistent with the rank ordering of symptom severity based on the descriptions in the medical literature. In general, statistically speaking, the number of chainlink genes and the chainlink connectivity both appear to relate monotonically to the severity of the speech disorder. 13 of 33 (1) Entropy 2023, 25, 897 Table 2.

Inferences A wealth of conclusions can be drawn from Table 1 (and from its more detailed version, Table A1 in Appendix A). However, we focus only on those that help validate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm. 4.1. Voice Chains as Predictors of Speech Characteristics Of the 76 syndromes in Table A1, voice chains were found to exist for all. By our hypothesis, this would imply that in all cases, there is a potential for voice to be affected. The syndromes 15q11\u2013q13 and Xq28 have two versions each, divided in the medical literature based on symptoms, rather than gene composition of the microdeletion region. We can therefore combine them for analysis, leaving us with 74 syndromes to be analyzed. For the syndrome 16q22, no information about the speech issues was found in the medical literature. Only the remaining 73 syndromes are considered in the analysis below. Entropy 2023, 25, 897 The incidence of speech pathologies (including all forms of pathologies) among the general population is reported to be about 5% [65], and between 2.3% and 24.6% among children [66]. Of the 73 syndromes, 17 syndromes had both level-1 and level-2 voice chains, while 56 had only level-2 chains. The occurrence of speech aberrations was reported for all 17 syndromes with level-1 chains and for all but 6 of the 56 syndromes with only level-2 voice chains. Thus, voice chains correlate highly with the existence of speech anomalies. 4.2. Voice Chains as Information-Carrying Entities Let us study how voice chains correlate with the presence or absence of speci\ufb01c voice problems. Such correlations would show that voice chains carry information about how the voice may be affected. This information is expected to be coarse-grained since we only take the presence or absence of any gene into consideration and consider no other cytogenetic information related to it. From Table A1, we observe the following. Level-1 chains: The number of level-1 chainlink genes is limited to 1 or 2 in all cases and is not amenable to statistical analysis. However, we make the following observations: 1. 2. 3. Level-1 voice chains co-occur with speech problems 100% of the time. For all instances where level-1 voice chains are present, severe symptoms occur 100% of the time (impaired, delayed or absent speech). For all instances of syndromes with no effect on speech (i.e., where normal is not just one of a range of other speech symptoms), level-1 chains are absent 100% of the the time. Level-2 Chains: Level-2 voice chains are present in all cases and co-occur with speech disorders in all but 6 cases; thus, in only 6 cases has speech been reported to be normal. Therefore, level-2 voice chains co-occur with speech problems 91.8% of the time. We note that a syndrome may have level-2 voice chains through many chainlink genes, which could number in the tens or even hundreds. Each of the chainlink genes could, in turn, also be associated with multiple other pathways, in addition to the one connecting it to FOXP2. We refer to the total number of pathways that include the chainlink genes of a syndrome as its \u201cchainlink connectivity\u201d. Table 2 presents some statistics of syndromes, chainlink genes, and chainlink connec- tivity associated with speech disorders of different severity.The problems considered are: absent speech (the most severe symptom), impaired speech (a symptom that is less severe than absent), delayed speech (a cognitive symptom that is also less severe than absent and comparable in severity to impaired speech\u2014a physical symptom), dysarthric speech (a symptom related to physical issues), and apraxic speech (due to CNS disorders; this is less severe compared to absent speech and often subsumes idiosyncratic speech). Each row of the table represents one type of speech problem and shows the number of syndromes associated with it, the mean and median of the counts of chainlink genes for the syndromes, and the mean and median of the chainlink connectivities of the syndromes. From an inspection of Table 2, a distinct pattern emerges. Rank ordering the symptoms by ascending order of the means of the counts of chainlink genes, we see that their connectivities also fall in almost the same order: normal(32, 404) < apraxia(43, 675) < dysarthria(43, 725) < impaired(46, 734) < delayed(47, 682) < absent(60, 902) This rank ordering is consistent with the rank ordering of symptom severity based on the descriptions in the medical literature.
