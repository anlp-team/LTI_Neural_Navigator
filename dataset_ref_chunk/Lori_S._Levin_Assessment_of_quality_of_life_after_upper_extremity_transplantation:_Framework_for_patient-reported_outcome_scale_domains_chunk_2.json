PROs are lacking for UE transplant, although this format for outcomes assessment is well suited for a QOL-improving intervention like VCA, given that the perspective of the patient is central to defining treatment success. Members of our research team have previously used these methods for developing condition-specific PRO measurement systems for spinal cord injury (Tulsky et al., 2011, 2015b,c; Tulsky and Kisala, 2015) and traumatic brain injury (Tulsky et al., 2016; Tulsky and Kisala, 2019), and we are currently developing item banks for limb injury and amputation (Tyner et al., 2018). The initial steps in this PRO development process are to obtain substantive stakeholder feedback to guide development of such a system and to review existing measures for content (Bjorner and Ware, 1998; Bjorner et al., 2007; De Walt et al., 2007; Kisala and Tulsky, 2010; PROMIS, 2013). Thus far, our team has documented the domains of QOL impacted by UE transplant by soliciting stakeholder input (Tulsky et al., 2023) using a grounded theory-based qualitative approach (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1998; Kisala and Tulsky, 2010). The findings from this work are described briefly below. Our qualitative work has outlined domain areas specific to stakeholders of UE transplantation and we have used this information to determine where new PROs are needed. The present report describes these newly identified domains and the approach for drafting new PRO items. Materials and methods Qualitative stakeholder focus groups and individual interviews Stakeholder feedback was collected from UE transplant experts and clinicians (i.e., surgeons, nurses, mental health professionals, and physical and occupational therapists) through a series of focus groups, and from patients who have received UE transplant via individual telephone interviews. The full methodology and findings have been reported in a separate manuscript (Tulsky et al., 2023) but will be described here briefly. Three focus groups were conducted at the 2018 meeting of the American Society for Reconstructive Transplantation, and 10 focus groups were held across five UE transplant centers in the United States in 2019\u20132020. In total, 59 clinicians and other UE transplant experts along with five UE transplant recipients provided input on the most important domains of health-related frontiersin.org Tyner et al. QOL (HRQOL) for UE transplant. Trained data collectors and doctoral-level co-investigators conducted all sessions using open- ended semi-structured discussion guides to lead the groups or interviews. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. All participants provided informed consent and data collection was approved by Institutional the University of Delaware Review Board. This stakeholder input was analyzed qualitatively using a grounded-theory-based (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1998) approach that our team has used in several prior studies to identify important HRQOL domains in other clinical populations (Kisala and Tulsky, 2010; Slavin et al., 2010; Carlozzi et al., 2011; Tulsky et al., 2011, 2015b, 2016). Open, axial, and selective coding were employed to determine the important HRQOL themes (MacQueen et al., 1998; Morgan et al., 1998; Braun and Clarke, 2006; Guest et al., 2012). The results demonstrated that there are numerous domains relevant to HRQOL after UE transplantation that can be measured by existing PRO systems that cover topics salient to many other clinical populations (e.g., fine motor functioning, anxiety, and pain interference). However, several domains of HRQOL that are unique to UE transplantation were identified as well. This highlighted the need for new item development to ensure HRQOL assessments are comprehensive. The framework defined in this manuscript provides the roadmap for how to draft new PRO items and demonstrates how the qualitative results helped define these new HRQOL domains. Identifying gaps in HRQOL measurement for UE transplant and defining domains New HRQOL content domains important to UE transplant recipients were identified in response to the qualitative input from stakeholders (Tulsky et al., 2023). The content coverage of each domain was designed to be directly responsive to the comments from stakeholders. Quotes from the interviews or focus groups were used as source material for new item text. To guide the future development of items, domain definitions were articulated and refined for each of the new domain areas. Results Eight new HRQOL content domains were developed based on stakeholder input. The subject, span, and relevant subtopics of each domain were defined. See Table 1 for a brief summary of these eight HRQOL content domains. Figure 1 contains a visual representation of how the domains are related across psychosocial and physical HRQOL.

PROs are lacking for UE transplant, although this format for outcomes assessment is well suited for a QOL-improving intervention like VCA, given that the perspective of the patient is central to defining treatment success. Members of our research team have previously used these methods for developing condition-specific PRO measurement systems for spinal cord injury (Tulsky et al., 2011, 2015b,c; Tulsky and Kisala, 2015) and traumatic brain injury (Tulsky et al., 2016; Tulsky and Kisala, 2019), and we are currently developing item banks for limb injury and amputation (Tyner et al., 2018). The initial steps in this PRO development process are to obtain substantive stakeholder feedback to guide development of such a system and to review existing measures for content (Bjorner and Ware, 1998; Bjorner et al., 2007; De Walt et al., 2007; Kisala and Tulsky, 2010; PROMIS, 2013). Thus far, our team has documented the domains of QOL impacted by UE transplant by soliciting stakeholder input (Tulsky et al., 2023) using a grounded theory-based qualitative approach (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1998; Kisala and Tulsky, 2010). The findings from this work are described briefly below. Our qualitative work has outlined domain areas specific to stakeholders of UE transplantation and we have used this information to determine where new PROs are needed. The present report describes these newly identified domains and the approach for drafting new PRO items. Materials and methods Qualitative stakeholder focus groups and individual interviews Stakeholder feedback was collected from UE transplant experts and clinicians (i.e., surgeons, nurses, mental health professionals, and physical and occupational therapists) through a series of focus groups, and from patients who have received UE transplant via individual telephone interviews. The full methodology and findings have been reported in a separate manuscript (Tulsky et al., 2023) but will be described here briefly. Three focus groups were conducted at the 2018 meeting of the American Society for Reconstructive Transplantation, and 10 focus groups were held across five UE transplant centers in the United States in 2019\u20132020. In total, 59 clinicians and other UE transplant experts along with five UE transplant recipients provided input on the most important domains of health-related frontiersin.org Tyner et al. QOL (HRQOL) for UE transplant. Trained data collectors and doctoral-level co-investigators conducted all sessions using open- ended semi-structured discussion guides to lead the groups or interviews. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. All participants provided informed consent and data collection was approved by Institutional the University of Delaware Review Board. This stakeholder input was analyzed qualitatively using a grounded-theory-based (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1998) approach that our team has used in several prior studies to identify important HRQOL domains in other clinical populations (Kisala and Tulsky, 2010; Slavin et al., 2010; Carlozzi et al., 2011; Tulsky et al., 2011, 2015b, 2016). Open, axial, and selective coding were employed to determine the important HRQOL themes (MacQueen et al., 1998; Morgan et al., 1998; Braun and Clarke, 2006; Guest et al., 2012). The results demonstrated that there are numerous domains relevant to HRQOL after UE transplantation that can be measured by existing PRO systems that cover topics salient to many other clinical populations (e.g., fine motor functioning, anxiety, and pain interference). However, several domains of HRQOL that are unique to UE transplantation were identified as well. This highlighted the need for new item development to ensure HRQOL assessments are comprehensive. The framework defined in this manuscript provides the roadmap for how to draft new PRO items and demonstrates how the qualitative results helped define these new HRQOL domains. Identifying gaps in HRQOL measurement for UE transplant and defining domains New HRQOL content domains important to UE transplant recipients were identified in response to the qualitative input from stakeholders (Tulsky et al., 2023). The content coverage of each domain was designed to be directly responsive to the comments from stakeholders. Quotes from the interviews or focus groups were used as source material for new item text. To guide the future development of items, domain definitions were articulated and refined for each of the new domain areas. Results Eight new HRQOL content domains were developed based on stakeholder input. The subject, span, and relevant subtopics of each domain were defined.

Frontiers in Psychology 02 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.989593 outcomes (PRO) measure development outlined and demonstrated by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS\u00ae) initiative funded by the National Institutes of Health Common Fund (PROMIS, 2013) and the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL\u2122) measurement system funded by the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (National Institutes of Health, n.d., Fries et al., 2005, Cella et al., 2006, 2007, 2011, Northwestern University, 2021). PROs are lacking for UE transplant, although this format for outcomes assessment is well suited for a QOL-improving intervention like VCA, given that the perspective of the patient is central to defining treatment success. Members of our research team have previously used these methods for developing condition-specific PRO measurement systems for spinal cord injury (Tulsky et al., 2011, 2015b,c; Tulsky and Kisala, 2015) and traumatic brain injury (Tulsky et al., 2016; Tulsky and Kisala, 2019), and we are currently developing item banks for limb injury and amputation (Tyner et al., 2018). The initial steps in this PRO development process are to obtain substantive stakeholder feedback to guide development of such a system and to review existing measures for content (Bjorner and Ware, 1998; Bjorner et al., 2007; De Walt et al., 2007; Kisala and Tulsky, 2010; PROMIS, 2013). Thus far, our team has documented the domains of QOL impacted by UE transplant by soliciting stakeholder input (Tulsky et al., 2023) using a grounded theory-based qualitative approach (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1998; Kisala and Tulsky, 2010). The findings from this work are described briefly below. Our qualitative work has outlined domain areas specific to stakeholders of UE transplantation and we have used this information to determine where new PROs are needed. The present report describes these newly identified domains and the approach for drafting new PRO items. Materials and methods Qualitative stakeholder focus groups and individual interviews Stakeholder feedback was collected from UE transplant experts and clinicians (i.e., surgeons, nurses, mental health professionals, and physical and occupational therapists) through a series of focus groups, and from patients who have received UE transplant via individual telephone interviews. The full methodology and findings have been reported in a separate manuscript (Tulsky et al., 2023) but will be described here briefly. Three focus groups were conducted at the 2018 meeting of the American Society for Reconstructive Transplantation, and 10 focus groups were held across five UE transplant centers in the United States in 2019\u20132020. In total, 59 clinicians and other UE transplant experts along with five UE transplant recipients provided input on the most important domains of health-related frontiersin.org Tyner et al. QOL (HRQOL) for UE transplant. Trained data collectors and doctoral-level co-investigators conducted all sessions using open- ended semi-structured discussion guides to lead the groups or interviews. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. All participants provided informed consent and data collection was approved by Institutional the University of Delaware Review Board. This stakeholder input was analyzed qualitatively using a grounded-theory-based (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1998) approach that our team has used in several prior studies to identify important HRQOL domains in other clinical populations (Kisala and Tulsky, 2010; Slavin et al., 2010; Carlozzi et al., 2011; Tulsky et al., 2011, 2015b, 2016). Open, axial, and selective coding were employed to determine the important HRQOL themes (MacQueen et al., 1998; Morgan et al., 1998; Braun and Clarke, 2006; Guest et al., 2012). The results demonstrated that there are numerous domains relevant to HRQOL after UE transplantation that can be measured by existing PRO systems that cover topics salient to many other clinical populations (e.g., fine motor functioning, anxiety, and pain interference). However, several domains of HRQOL that are unique to UE transplantation were identified as well. This highlighted the need for new item development to ensure HRQOL assessments are comprehensive. The framework defined in this manuscript provides the roadmap for how to draft new PRO items and demonstrates how the qualitative results helped define these new HRQOL domains. Identifying gaps in HRQOL measurement for UE transplant and defining domains New HRQOL content domains important to UE transplant recipients were identified in response to the qualitative input from stakeholders (Tulsky et al., 2023). The content coverage of each domain was designed to be directly responsive to the comments from stakeholders. Quotes from the interviews or focus groups were used as source material for new item text. To guide the future development of items, domain definitions were articulated and refined for each of the new domain areas. Results Eight new HRQOL content domains were developed based on stakeholder input. The subject, span, and relevant subtopics of each domain were defined. See Table 1 for a brief summary of these eight HRQOL content domains. Figure 1 contains a visual representation of how the domains are related across psychosocial and physical HRQOL. Each section below begins with a summary of the stakeholder input and exemplar quotes from the stakeholders are provided. Information on the subtopics considered for new PRO item drafting are described and examples of items are provided.
