In addition, a majority of these methods focus on using either group [54, 68] or counterfac- tual fairness [70, 72], often relying on a binary sensitive attribute to encode popularity. This can cause intrinsic limitations because popularity between items is not necessarily a binary state and such attributes may not be readily available. In this work, we propose a domain aware, individual fairness based approach for facilitating engaging music discovery. In order to facilitate the domain awareness of our approach we generate nuanced multi-modal track features, extensively augmenting two publicly available datasets. Using these novel feature sets, we show the importance of integrating musical similarity into a debiasing technique and show the effects of our method at learning expressive representations of items that are robust to the effects of popularity bias in the graph setting. Grounding our approach in the musical domain empowers us to leverage a ranking-based individual fair- ness definition and extend it to the bipartite graph setting. In doing so, we design a method that uses music features to fine-tune item representations such that they are reflective of information that is, in essence, a ground truth to the listening experience: two songs that sound similar should, at least somewhat, reflect this similarity in their learned representations. Finally, we compare our individ- ual fairness-based method with three other methods which are grounded in other canonical fairness notions and are not domain- aware. Through a series of empirical results, we show that our fairness framework enables us to outperform a series of accepted fairness benchmarks in both performance and recommendation of lesser known content on two important music recommendation tasks. In summary, the contributions of this paper are the following: (1) Problem Setting: we define the task of music discovery through the lens of domain-aware individual fairness, show- ing the intrinsic connections between individual fairness, musical similarity, popularity bias, and music discovery. (2) Dataset Design: we extensively augment two classic mu- sic recommendation datasets to generate a set of nuanced multi-modal track features, laying the foundation for future domain-aware mitigation techniques. (3) Method: (1) we provide a novel technical formulation of popularity bias (2) design a domain-aware ranking based individual fairness approach to mitigating popularity bias in graph-based recommendation. (4) Experiments: we show that our method outperforms three state of the art fairness benchmarks in the cold start setting. Rebecca Salganik, Fernando Diaz, and Golnoosh Farnadi Figure 1: Classic definition of Long Tail popularity settings[2] 2 Related Work In this section we contextualize our work by presenting relevant literature on the subjects of (1) popularity bias and (2) graph neural network (GNN) based recommender systems. 2.1 Popularity Bias in Recommendation Most broadly, popularity bias refers to a disparity between the treatment of popular and unpopular items at the hands of a recom- mender system. As such, this term is loosely tied to a collection of complementary terms including exposure bias [20], superstar eco- nomics [6], long tail recommendation [45], the Matthew effect [48], and aggregate diversity [5, 14]. There have been several different approaches to formulating popularity through some quantitative definition. One body of work defines popularity with respect to in- dividual items\u2019 visibility [20, 45, 69]. Another group of approaches attempts to simplify this process by applying some form of binning to the raw appearance values. Most notably, the long tail model [13, 23, 31, 50, 66] has risen to prominence as a popularity definition. As shown in Figure 1, we can see that the first 20% of items, called short head, take up a vast majority of the user interactions and the remaining 80%, or long tail and distant tail, have, even in aggregate, significantly fewer interactions. Often, splitting items into the short head and long tail (either including or removing distant tail) to define disparity in popularity can overcome the issues of range while still representing concrete disparities in item level visibility. There has been a lot of work done analyzing and codifying the nature of popularity bias in recommender systems [11, 17, 37, 38]. Approaches to mitigating popularity bias are often grounded in one of three methods: pre-processing [8], in-processing [54, 62, 71], or post-processing, [3, 45]. These mitigation strategies are often based on the instrumentation of various canonical fairness notions such as group fairness [3, 8, 54, 58, 68], counterfactual fairness [62, 69, 71], or individual fairness [15, 61]. We contrast our work with previous individual fairness ap- proaches in our use of the music feature space as a form of domain expertise in definition of item-item similarity. We argue that with- out this \u201canchoring\u201d an individual fairness method that uses the output of a recommender model, whether it be in learned represen- tation [61] or the relevance score [15], is already influenced by an item\u2019s popularity. Finally, in addition to the classical formulation of popularity bias, a group of works have explored the connection between popularity bias and novelty [44, 70, 72] where various metrics are designed to evaluate the novelty of a recommended list. We see our work as complimentary to the exploration in this area however, we differentiate our problem formulation because while novelty is an important aspect of discovery, without domain Fairness Through Domain Awareness: Mitigating Popularity Bias For Music Discovery awareness novelty alone does not account for musical similarity - a critical aspect of the discovery setting. 2.2 GNNs in Recommendation In recent years various graph neural network (GNN) architectures have been proposed for the recommendation domain [64]. For brevity, we will focus only on the two methods that are used as the backbone recommenders to the fairness mitigation techniques discussed later in this paper, however we refer to the following surveys [28, 65] for recent innovations in this domain.

Another group of approaches attempts to simplify this process by applying some form of binning to the raw appearance values. Most notably, the long tail model [13, 23, 31, 50, 66] has risen to prominence as a popularity definition. As shown in Figure 1, we can see that the first 20% of items, called short head, take up a vast majority of the user interactions and the remaining 80%, or long tail and distant tail, have, even in aggregate, significantly fewer interactions. Often, splitting items into the short head and long tail (either including or removing distant tail) to define disparity in popularity can overcome the issues of range while still representing concrete disparities in item level visibility. There has been a lot of work done analyzing and codifying the nature of popularity bias in recommender systems [11, 17, 37, 38]. Approaches to mitigating popularity bias are often grounded in one of three methods: pre-processing [8], in-processing [54, 62, 71], or post-processing, [3, 45]. These mitigation strategies are often based on the instrumentation of various canonical fairness notions such as group fairness [3, 8, 54, 58, 68], counterfactual fairness [62, 69, 71], or individual fairness [15, 61]. We contrast our work with previous individual fairness ap- proaches in our use of the music feature space as a form of domain expertise in definition of item-item similarity. We argue that with- out this \u201canchoring\u201d an individual fairness method that uses the output of a recommender model, whether it be in learned represen- tation [61] or the relevance score [15], is already influenced by an item\u2019s popularity. Finally, in addition to the classical formulation of popularity bias, a group of works have explored the connection between popularity bias and novelty [44, 70, 72] where various metrics are designed to evaluate the novelty of a recommended list. We see our work as complimentary to the exploration in this area however, we differentiate our problem formulation because while novelty is an important aspect of discovery, without domain Fairness Through Domain Awareness: Mitigating Popularity Bias For Music Discovery awareness novelty alone does not account for musical similarity - a critical aspect of the discovery setting. 2.2 GNNs in Recommendation In recent years various graph neural network (GNN) architectures have been proposed for the recommendation domain [64]. For brevity, we will focus only on the two methods that are used as the backbone recommenders to the fairness mitigation techniques discussed later in this paper, however we refer to the following surveys [28, 65] for recent innovations in this domain. In particular, PinSage [67] is an industry solution to graph-based recommendation.

In addition, a majority of these methods focus on using either group [54, 68] or counterfac- tual fairness [70, 72], often relying on a binary sensitive attribute to encode popularity. This can cause intrinsic limitations because popularity between items is not necessarily a binary state and such attributes may not be readily available. In this work, we propose a domain aware, individual fairness based approach for facilitating engaging music discovery. In order to facilitate the domain awareness of our approach we generate nuanced multi-modal track features, extensively augmenting two publicly available datasets. Using these novel feature sets, we show the importance of integrating musical similarity into a debiasing technique and show the effects of our method at learning expressive representations of items that are robust to the effects of popularity bias in the graph setting. Grounding our approach in the musical domain empowers us to leverage a ranking-based individual fair- ness definition and extend it to the bipartite graph setting. In doing so, we design a method that uses music features to fine-tune item representations such that they are reflective of information that is, in essence, a ground truth to the listening experience: two songs that sound similar should, at least somewhat, reflect this similarity in their learned representations. Finally, we compare our individ- ual fairness-based method with three other methods which are grounded in other canonical fairness notions and are not domain- aware. Through a series of empirical results, we show that our fairness framework enables us to outperform a series of accepted fairness benchmarks in both performance and recommendation of lesser known content on two important music recommendation tasks. In summary, the contributions of this paper are the following: (1) Problem Setting: we define the task of music discovery through the lens of domain-aware individual fairness, show- ing the intrinsic connections between individual fairness, musical similarity, popularity bias, and music discovery. (2) Dataset Design: we extensively augment two classic mu- sic recommendation datasets to generate a set of nuanced multi-modal track features, laying the foundation for future domain-aware mitigation techniques. (3) Method: (1) we provide a novel technical formulation of popularity bias (2) design a domain-aware ranking based individual fairness approach to mitigating popularity bias in graph-based recommendation. (4) Experiments: we show that our method outperforms three state of the art fairness benchmarks in the cold start setting.
