As a hygroscopic component, the increasing fraction of nitrate during pollution episodes facilitates the enhancement of aerosol hygroscopicity and activity. The time series of PNSD in Figure 2b shows that aerosol particles mainly concentrate in nucle-ation mode (Dp < 100 nm) during the clean periods. However, as the PM2.5 mass concen-tration increases, there is a signi\ufb01cant increase in the proportion of particle numbers in the accumulation mode, accompanied by a decrease in D50. The average D50 at SS = 0.1% (172 \u00b1 13 nm) was signi\ufb01cantly larger than that at SS = 0.2% (102 \u00b1 8 nm) and SS = 0.3% (84 \u00b1 7 nm), indicating that the SS variation was more sensitive to D50 at a lower SS range.

The sources and properties of aerosol particles vary with di\ufb00erent size ranges, leading to a diverse diurnal variation in D50 at di\ufb00erent SS (Figure 3a\u2013c). As a typical tracer for SOA formation, the f44 can be associated with OA hygroscopicity owing to their positive cor-relations reported in previous studies [54,55].

Discussion 4.1. Impacts of Aerosol Physicochemical Properties on CCN Activity 4.1.1. Aerosol Chemical Properties The diurnal variations in D50 at different SS, the mass fraction of m/z 44 in organic mass spectrum (f 44), aerosol chemical composition, and PNSD are given in Figure 3. The sources and properties of aerosol particles vary with different size ranges, leading to a diverse diurnal variation in D50 at different SS (Figure 3a\u2013c). As a typical tracer for SOA formation, the f 44 can be associated with OA hygroscopicity owing to their positive correlations reported in previous studies [54,55]. Both f 44 and the sum fraction of hygroscopic inorganic components (nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium) had a noticeable peak in the afternoon (Figure 3d,e), implying they were signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uenced by photochemical oxidation in the daytime. Meanwhile, the minimum of D50 for all three SS conditions occurred around 15:00, corresponding to the diurnal peak time of f 44 and the fraction of inorganic components. This suggests photochemical reactions on daily basis played an important role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity. 70D50 (nm) SS = 0.3% Figure 3.

The lines and dots show the median and mean; box lower/higher bounds show the 25th and 75th and whiskers show the 10th and 90th percentiles. Note that the diurnal cycles of D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3% exhibited a remarkable max-imum around 18:00, with additional peaks occurring at 7:00 and 12:00. In contrast, no prominent diurnal peak occurred in the diurnal cycle of D50 at SS = 0.1%. Tra\ufb03c and cook-ing emissions are the main sources of primary OA (POA) in Beijing, and these fresh emis-sions could lead to a decrease in f44 [56,57]. Therefore, the reduction time in the f44 diurnal cycle matched to the periods of daily source emissions, such as morning and evening traf-\ufb01c peaks, as well as lunch and dinner times. Consequently, the hydrophobic POA was not favor for CCN activation, leading to an increase in D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. In addition, the diurnal variation in aerosol number concentration within the size range of 60\u2013150 nm was consistent with that of D50 (SS = 0.2% and 0.3%) (Figure 3f), indicating that particles within this size range were signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uenced"}, {"question": " How does reduction in f44 diurnal cycle relate to daily source emissions?,answer: Reduction time in the f44 diurnal cycle matched to the periods of daily source emissions", "ref_chunk": "and chloride (2.5% \u00b1 1.8%), respectively.

These characteristics of aerosol composition are consistent with recent studies, which reported that nitrate is now the principal component of Beijing winter haze pollution [33,34]. As a hygroscopic component, the increasing fraction of nitrate during pollution episodes facilitates the enhancement of aerosol hygroscopicity and activity. The time series of PNSD in Figure 2b shows that aerosol particles mainly concentrate in nucle-ation mode (Dp < 100 nm) during the clean periods. However, as the PM2.5 mass concen-tration increases, there is a signi\ufb01cant increase in the proportion of particle numbers in the accumulation mode, accompanied by a decrease in D50. The average D50 at SS = 0.1% (172 \u00b1 13 nm) was signi\ufb01cantly larger than that at SS = 0.2% (102 \u00b1 8 nm) and SS = 0.3% (84 \u00b1 7 nm), indicating that the SS variation was more sensitive to D50 at a lower SS range.
