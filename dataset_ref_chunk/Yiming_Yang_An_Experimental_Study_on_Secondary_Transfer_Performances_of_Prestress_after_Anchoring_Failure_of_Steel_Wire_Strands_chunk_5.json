It can be seen from Table 4 that the initial prestress of S4 is the lowest, but its transfer length is the highest. Compared to S4, S5 shows higher initial prestress, but the lowest secondary transfer length. This is mainly because concrete strength is an important factor that in\ufb02uences secondary transfer length. The concrete with the greater compressive strength has the higher tensile strength, and the possibility of microcracks in concrete declines.

Numerical Simulation Analysis A finite element calculation model of the damaged concrete components was con- structed using ABAQUS (version of Abaqus CAE2016, Dassault systems, V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France). The structure was constructed using the separated model. Concrete was simulated using the reduced integral hexahedral units (C3D8R) and the concrete applied the consti- tutive damage of plasticity (CDP) [31]. Both ordinary steel bars and prestressed bars were simulated using truss units (T3D2). The double broken line equi-hardening constitutive relation model was chosen. The bond slip between the steel wire strand and the concrete was simulated using the nonlinear spring units (SPRING2), which was realized by setting units parallel and perpendicular to bars at nodes between the concrete and steel wire strand. In the model, there were 28,522 nodes and 25,723 units. It should be noted that in order to more reasonably simulate the local load effects at the end of the beam, a strategy of manually refining the mesh locally was employed. Within a radius of 47.0 mm from the center of the cross section (i.e., around the steel strands), the elements were divided into four smaller elements. These elements had dimensions of 9.5 mm, 9.5 mm, 11.0 mm, and 17.0 mm, respectively, along the radial direction of the steel strands. Except for the above area, the dimensions of all the other units were 20 mm \u00d7 18.75 mm \u00d7 20 mm. The whole model structure is shown in Figure 8. Metals 2023, 13, 1489 To simulate the fracture of the steel wire strand, the passivation and activation of units were realized through model changes in the interaction module. Step 1 involves inactivating all units of the structure. Step 2 involves activating the concrete units, anchor bearing plate, steel wire strand, reinforcement cage, and boundary conditions, except the grouting part. Step 3 involves applying prestress through the temperature-falling method. Step 4 involves activating the grouting units. Step 5 is to \u201cpassivate\u201d the steel wire strand units and anchor base plate at the fracture position. To verify the validity of the secondary transfer of residual prestress, the stress distributions in the concrete and steel wire strand when the effective prestress at the corrosion side was 50% and 0% before and during the corrosion in the zone are provided in Figures 9 and 10, respectively. It can be seen from Figure 9 that with the increase in the corrosion rate, the prestress at the concrete corrosion side of the central section of the beam declines slightly, and it is transferred to the non-corrosion end gradually. Obvious shrinkage and slippage with the strand are generated. This can prove that residual prestress can be transferred again. Meanwhile, the prestress distribution in anchor concrete on the non-corrosion side basically remains the same. It can be seen from Figure 10 that the prestress declines sharply with the increase in the corrosion rate. As the distance to the corrosion end increases, the reduction in the effective prestress gradually slows down until it stays basically constant. In this way, the secondary transfer of residual prestress is finished. As the corrosion fracture process is completed, the effective prestress on the non-corrosion side decreases from 1186 MPa to 1165 MPa. Therefore, the residual prestress can undergo secondary transfer after the end of the corrosion fracture, which is similar to the pre-tensioning components. However, the effective prestress will decrease. Since concrete strength has significant influences on the secondary transfer length of residual prestress, the stress distribution in the concrete and steel wire strand when the initial effective pre-tension values of S1, S3, and S4 are 450 kN was discussed with reference to the design parameters of the beams. The results are shown in Figures 11 and 12. It can be seen from Figure 11 that the secondary transfer length of residual prestress is negatively related with concrete strength. The influences of concrete strength on the anchoring prestressed zone on the corrosion size are decreased obviously. It can be seen from Figure 12 that the secondary transfer length of the residual prestress of S1, S3, and S4 were 650 mm, 700 mm, and 630 mm. With the increase in concrete strength, the stress variation gradient of the steel wire strand on the fracture size is more obvious. A shorter secondary transfer distance is conducive to reaching a basically constant stress of the steel wire strand.

The influences of concrete strength on the anchoring prestressed zone on the corrosion size are decreased obviously. It can be seen from Figure 12 that the secondary transfer length of the residual prestress of S1, S3, and S4 were 650 mm, 700 mm, and 630 mm. With the increase in concrete strength, the stress variation gradient of the steel wire strand on the fracture size is more obvious. A shorter secondary transfer distance is conducive to reaching a basically constant stress of the steel wire strand.

Numerical Simulation Analysis A finite element calculation model of the damaged concrete components was con- structed using ABAQUS (version of Abaqus CAE2016, Dassault systems, V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France). The structure was constructed using the separated model. Concrete was simulated using the reduced integral hexahedral units (C3D8R) and the concrete applied the consti- tutive damage of plasticity (CDP) [31]. Both ordinary steel bars and prestressed bars were simulated using truss units (T3D2). The double broken line equi-hardening constitutive relation model was chosen. The bond slip between the steel wire strand and the concrete was simulated using the nonlinear spring units (SPRING2), which was realized by setting units parallel and perpendicular to bars at nodes between the concrete and steel wire strand. In the model, there were 28,522 nodes and 25,723 units. It should be noted that in order to more reasonably simulate the local load effects at the end of the beam, a strategy of manually refining the mesh locally was employed. Within a radius of 47.0 mm from the center of the cross section (i.e., around the steel strands), the elements were divided into four smaller elements. These elements had dimensions of 9.5 mm, 9.5 mm, 11.0 mm, and 17.0 mm, respectively, along the radial direction of the steel strands. Except for the above area, the dimensions of all the other units were 20 mm \u00d7 18.75 mm \u00d7 20 mm. The whole model structure is shown in Figure 8. Metals 2023, 13, 1489 To simulate the fracture of the steel wire strand, the passivation and activation of units were realized through model changes in the interaction module. Step 1 involves inactivating all units of the structure. Step 2 involves activating the concrete units, anchor bearing plate, steel wire strand, reinforcement cage, and boundary conditions, except the grouting part. Step 3 involves applying prestress through the temperature-falling method. Step 4 involves activating the grouting units. Step 5 is to \u201cpassivate\u201d the steel wire strand units and anchor base plate at the fracture position. To verify the validity of the secondary transfer of residual prestress, the stress distributions in the concrete and steel wire strand when the effective prestress at the corrosion side was 50% and 0% before and during the corrosion in the zone are provided in Figures 9 and 10, respectively. It can be seen from Figure 9 that with the increase in the corrosion rate, the prestress at the concrete corrosion side of the central section of the beam declines slightly, and it is transferred to the non-corrosion end gradually. Obvious shrinkage and slippage with the strand are generated. This can prove that residual prestress can be transferred again. Meanwhile, the prestress distribution in anchor concrete on the non-corrosion side basically remains the same. It can be seen from Figure 10 that the prestress declines sharply with the increase in the corrosion rate. As the distance to the corrosion end increases, the reduction in the effective prestress gradually slows down until it stays basically constant. In this way, the secondary transfer of residual prestress is finished. As the corrosion fracture process is completed, the effective prestress on the non-corrosion side decreases from 1186 MPa to 1165 MPa. Therefore, the residual prestress can undergo secondary transfer after the end of the corrosion fracture, which is similar to the pre-tensioning components. However, the effective prestress will decrease. Since concrete strength has significant influences on the secondary transfer length of residual prestress, the stress distribution in the concrete and steel wire strand when the initial effective pre-tension values of S1, S3, and S4 are 450 kN was discussed with reference to the design parameters of the beams.

Therefore, the residual prestress can undergo secondary transfer after the end of the corrosion fracture, which is similar to the pre-tensioning components. However, the effective prestress will decrease. Since concrete strength has significant influences on the secondary transfer length of residual prestress, the stress distribution in the concrete and steel wire strand when the initial effective pre-tension values of S1, S3, and S4 are 450 kN was discussed with reference to the design parameters of the beams. The results are shown in Figures 11 and 12. It can be seen from Figure 11 that the secondary transfer length of residual prestress is negatively related with concrete strength. The influences of concrete strength on the anchoring prestressed zone on the corrosion size are decreased obviously. It can be seen from Figure 12 that the secondary transfer length of the residual prestress of S1, S3, and S4 were 650 mm, 700 mm, and 630 mm. With the increase in concrete strength, the stress variation gradient of the steel wire strand on the fracture size is more obvious. A shorter secondary transfer distance is conducive to reaching a basically constant stress of the steel wire strand. Figure"}], "doc_text": "are shown in Table 4. It can be seen from Table 4 that the initial prestress of S4 is the lowest, but its transfer length is the highest. Compared to S4, S5 shows higher initial prestress, but the lowest secondary transfer length. This is mainly because concrete strength is an important factor that in\ufb02uences secondary transfer length. The concrete with the greater compressive strength has the higher tensile strength, and the possibility of microcracks in concrete declines. This also determines the stronger bond force between the concrete and the steel wire strand, which needs a smaller transfer length. S5 and S6 had stirrup reinforcement, but this had no obvious in\ufb02uence on secondary transfer length because the prestress in the secondary transfer is insuf\ufb01cient to make the concrete specimens develop splitting failure. The stirrups restrict the development of cracks in the concrete, and the three-way constraint against concrete is not increased obviously. It can be seen from Table 4 that the transfer length in Equation (4) is smaller than that in Equation (5), with an error of 19.3\u201324.5%. The maximum error is observed in S3. The transfer length in Equation (4) is smaller than the calculated transfer length in the standards, which is related to the relatively conservative and safe calculations found in the standards.

Numerical Simulation Analysis A finite element calculation model of the damaged concrete components was con- structed using ABAQUS (version of Abaqus CAE2016, Dassault systems, V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France). The structure was constructed using the separated model. Concrete was simulated using the reduced integral hexahedral units (C3D8R) and the concrete applied the consti- tutive damage of plasticity (CDP) [31]. Both ordinary steel bars and prestressed bars were simulated using truss units (T3D2). The double broken line equi-hardening constitutive relation model was chosen. The bond slip between the steel wire strand and the concrete was simulated using the nonlinear spring units (SPRING2), which was realized by setting units parallel and perpendicular to bars at nodes between the concrete and steel wire strand. In the model, there were 28,522 nodes and 25,723 units. It should be noted that in order to more reasonably simulate the local load effects at the end of the beam, a strategy of manually refining the mesh locally was employed. Within a radius of 47.0 mm from the center of the cross section (i.e., around the steel strands), the elements were divided into four smaller elements. These elements had dimensions of 9.5 mm, 9.5 mm, 11.0 mm, and 17.0 mm, respectively, along the radial direction of the steel strands. Except for the above area, the dimensions of all the other units were 20 mm \u00d7 18.75 mm \u00d7 20 mm. The whole model structure is shown in Figure 8. Metals 2023, 13, 1489 To simulate the fracture of the steel wire strand, the passivation and activation of units were realized through model changes in the interaction module. Step 1 involves inactivating all units of the structure. Step 2 involves activating the concrete units, anchor bearing plate, steel wire strand, reinforcement cage, and boundary conditions, except the grouting part. Step 3 involves applying prestress through the temperature-falling method. Step 4 involves activating the grouting units. Step 5 is to \u201cpassivate\u201d the steel wire strand units and anchor base plate at the fracture position. To verify the validity of the secondary transfer of residual prestress, the stress distributions in the concrete and steel wire strand when the effective prestress at the corrosion side was 50% and 0% before and during the corrosion in the zone are provided in Figures 9 and 10, respectively. It can be seen from Figure 9 that with the increase in the corrosion rate, the prestress at the concrete corrosion side of the central section of the beam declines slightly, and it is transferred to the non-corrosion end gradually. Obvious shrinkage and slippage with the strand are generated. This can prove that residual prestress can be transferred again. Meanwhile, the prestress distribution in anchor concrete on the non-corrosion side basically remains the same. It can be seen from Figure 10 that the prestress declines sharply with the increase in the corrosion rate. As the distance to the corrosion end increases, the reduction in the effective prestress gradually slows down until it stays basically constant. In this way, the secondary transfer of residual prestress is finished. As the corrosion fracture process is completed, the effective prestress on the non-corrosion side decreases from 1186 MPa to 1165 MPa. Therefore, the residual prestress can undergo secondary transfer after the end of the corrosion fracture, which is similar to the pre-tensioning components. However, the effective prestress will decrease. Since concrete strength has significant influences on the secondary transfer length of residual prestress, the stress distribution in the concrete and steel wire strand when the initial effective pre-tension values of S1, S3, and S4 are 450 kN was discussed with reference to the design parameters of the beams. The results are shown in Figures 11 and 12. It can be seen from Figure 11 that the secondary transfer length of residual prestress is negatively related with concrete strength. The influences of concrete strength on the anchoring prestressed zone on the corrosion size are decreased obviously. It can be seen from Figure 12 that the secondary transfer length of the residual prestress of S1, S3, and S4 were 650 mm, 700 mm, and 630 mm. With the increase in concrete strength, the stress variation gradient of the steel wire strand on the fracture size is more obvious. A shorter secondary transfer distance is conducive to reaching a basically constant stress of the steel wire strand. Figure"}
