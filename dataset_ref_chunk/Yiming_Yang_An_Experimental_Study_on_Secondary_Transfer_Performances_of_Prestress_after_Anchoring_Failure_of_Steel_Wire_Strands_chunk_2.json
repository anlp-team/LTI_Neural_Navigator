Under the coupling effect of high stress and the environment, prestressed tendons not only have electrochemical corrosion similar to ordinary steel bars, but may also have several forms of hydrogen embrittlement, stress corrosion, and crevice corrosion. As a result, the prestressed tendons may develop brittle fracture when the prestress is far lower than the yielding strength [24]. The prestress which is lost at prestressed beam end after anchoring failure can be transferred again through bonding. The mechanism is similar to pre-tensioned prestressed tendons, but there are still some differences. On the one hand, post-tensioned rebars are built in a dense arrangement, thus making the Hall effect more signi\ufb01cant [25]. On the other hand, the corrosion of prestressed beams progresses slowly, which is different from the fast expansion of pre-tensioned rebars. Moreover, differences in bond force may also in\ufb02uence the transfer of stresses. Secondary transfer of residual prestress and anchoring after the stress fracture of prestressed beams have been studied preliminarily [26]. In experiments, specimens were reinforced by replacing ribbed steel tubes with corrugated pipes. The results demonstrated that the prestressed beams can achieve a second anchoring through the bonding of press mortar after anchoring failure. Additionally, the bending strength of species after the local fracture of steel wire strands has been investigated, and it was found that the bending capacity of components with end anchoring failure decreased by only 7.2% [27,28].

Three seven-wire prestressed strands with a diameter of 15.2 mm and a strength grade of 1860 MPa were designed in the corrugated pipe. A total of 8 pieces of \u03a612 mm HRB400 deformed bars were arranged longitudinally out of the corrugated pipe. The stirrups were arranged along the length direction of the specimen with a spacing of 100 mm. To study the in\ufb02uences of concrete strength and the stirrup reinforcement ratio on stress transfer and anchoring performances of the prestressed beam after failure, three concrete strength grades (C40, C50 and C60) and three stirrup con\ufb01guration forms (\u03a68@100 mm, \u03a610@100 mm and \u03a612@100 mm) were designed for the specimens. The stirrup model used HPB235 plain round bars. The reinforcement layout of the specimens is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Dimensions and reinforcement of S1\u2013S5 (unit: mm). The tension control stress of the steel wire strand is 1395 MPa, which is 0.75 times that of the standard tensile strength of the strand. The material properties of steel wire strands and ordinary steel bars are listed in Table 2. The concrete applied was the 42.5 ordinary Portland cement, and natural river sand was used as the \ufb01ne aggregate. The coarse aggregate used graded broken stones, and the maximum nominal particle size was 25 mm. 3 of 19 Metals 2023, 13, 1489 4 of 19 Tap water in the laboratory was used for stirring and mixing the materials. The mixing ratio of C40 concrete was determined as cement/sand/stone/water = 1:1.33:2.82:0.42. The mixing ratio of C50 concrete was cement/sand/stone/water = 1:1.62:2.73:0.44. The mixing ratio of C60 concrete was cement/sand/stone/water = 1:1.59:3.15:0.44. The commercial cement paste with the same grade of concrete was applied as the mortar. The same batch of concrete was collected and prepared into cubic standard specimens and cured together with test components. The average 28 days compressive strengths of C50, C40, and C60 concrete specimens were 53.5 MPa, 42.6 MPa, and 63.3 MPa, respectively. Table 2.

Three seven-wire prestressed strands with a diameter of 15.2 mm and a strength grade of 1860 MPa were designed in the corrugated pipe. A total of 8 pieces of \u03a612 mm HRB400 deformed bars were arranged longitudinally out of the corrugated pipe. The stirrups were arranged along the length direction of the specimen with a spacing of 100 mm. To study the in\ufb02uences of concrete strength and the stirrup reinforcement ratio on stress transfer and anchoring performances of the prestressed beam after failure, three concrete strength grades (C40, C50 and C60) and three stirrup con\ufb01guration forms (\u03a68@100 mm, \u03a610@100 mm and \u03a612@100 mm) were designed for the specimens. The stirrup model used HPB235 plain round bars. The reinforcement layout of the specimens is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Dimensions and reinforcement of S1\u2013S5 (unit: mm). The tension control stress of the steel wire strand is 1395 MPa, which is 0.75 times that of the standard tensile strength of the strand. The material properties of steel wire strands and ordinary steel bars are listed in Table 2. The concrete applied was the 42.5 ordinary Portland cement, and natural river sand was used as the \ufb01ne aggregate. The coarse aggregate used graded broken stones, and the maximum nominal particle size was 25 mm. 3 of 19 Metals 2023, 13, 1489 4 of 19 Tap water in the laboratory was used for stirring and mixing the materials. The mixing ratio of C40 concrete was determined as cement/sand/stone/water = 1:1.33:2.82:0.42. The mixing ratio of C50 concrete was cement/sand/stone/water = 1:1.62:2.73:0.44. The mixing ratio of C60 concrete was cement/sand/stone/water = 1:1.59:3.15:0.44. The commercial cement paste with the same grade of concrete was applied as the mortar. The same batch of concrete was collected and prepared into cubic standard specimens and cured together with test components. The average 28 days compressive strengths of C50, C40, and C60 concrete specimens were 53.5 MPa, 42.6 MPa, and 63.3 MPa, respectively. Table 2.

Under the coupling effect of high stress and the environment, prestressed tendons not only have electrochemical corrosion similar to ordinary steel bars, but may also have several forms of hydrogen embrittlement, stress corrosion, and crevice corrosion.

The mixing ratio of C40 concrete was determined as cement/sand/stone/water = 1:1.33:2.82:0.42. The mixing ratio of C50 concrete was cement/sand/stone/water = 1:1.62:2.73:0.44. The mixing ratio of C60 concrete was cement/sand/stone/water = 1:1.59:3.15:0.44. The commercial cement paste with the same grade of concrete was applied as the mortar. The same batch of concrete was collected and prepared into cubic standard specimens and cured together with test components. The average 28 days compressive strengths of C50, C40, and C60 concrete specimens were 53.5 MPa, 42.6 MPa, and 63.3 MPa, respectively. Table 2.

Layout of Strain Gauges Since the test steel wire strand was twisted with 7 wires, there was a twist angle. It is impossible to make axial notches on the steel wire strand or to paste strain gauges on the surface to monitor the strains of the strand.

The suspension method of the embedded strain gauge is as follows: \ufb01rstly, a larger-diameter corrugated pipe is used, and a steel plate is set below the anchor during the production of specimens.

Under the coupling effect of high stress and the environment, prestressed tendons not only have electrochemical corrosion similar to ordinary steel bars, but may also have several forms of hydrogen embrittlement, stress corrosion, and crevice corrosion. As a result, the prestressed tendons may develop brittle fracture when the prestress is far lower than the yielding strength [24]. The prestress which is lost at prestressed beam end after anchoring failure can be transferred again through bonding. The mechanism is similar to pre-tensioned prestressed tendons, but there are still some differences. On the one hand, post-tensioned rebars are built in a dense arrangement, thus making the Hall effect more signi\ufb01cant [25]. On the other hand, the corrosion of prestressed beams progresses slowly, which is different from the fast expansion of pre-tensioned rebars. Moreover, differences in bond force may also in\ufb02uence the transfer of stresses. Secondary transfer of residual prestress and anchoring after the stress fracture of prestressed beams have been studied preliminarily [26]. In experiments, specimens were reinforced by replacing ribbed steel tubes with corrugated pipes. The results demonstrated that the prestressed beams can achieve a second anchoring through the bonding of press mortar after anchoring failure. Additionally, the bending strength of species after the local fracture of steel wire strands has been investigated, and it was found that the bending capacity of components with end anchoring failure decreased by only 7.2% [27,28]. Never- theless, the calculation and evaluation methods of the secondary transfer length of residual prestress have not yet been reported in existing studies. Systematic studies on stress transfer after fracture failure of the end anchoring of prestressed beams are still lacking. In this study, an anchoring failure experiment at unilateral strand ends of six post- tensioning prestressed concrete specimens was carried out.

A total of 8 pieces of \u03a612 mm HRB400 deformed bars were arranged longitudinally out of the corrugated pipe. The stirrups were arranged along the length direction of the specimen with a spacing of 100 mm. To study the in\ufb02uences of concrete strength and the stirrup reinforcement ratio on stress transfer and anchoring performances of the prestressed beam after failure, three concrete strength grades (C40, C50 and C60) and three stirrup con\ufb01guration forms (\u03a68@100 mm, \u03a610@100 mm and \u03a612@100 mm) were designed for the specimens.
