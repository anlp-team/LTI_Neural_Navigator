Some HITs may beambiguous but just answer to the best of your abilities.Given a situation you will be asked to compare the ability of two different AI systems to come up with values, rights, and duties that arerelevant to this situation. Instructions (click to expand/collapse) (Optional) Please let us know if anything was unclear, if youexperienced any issues, or if you have any other feedback for us. Which system is more correct on average?In other words, which system makes fewer mistakes, or produces a higher fraction of relevant responses?System AAbout equal (try to avoid this answer unless necessary)System BWhich is more complete?Speci\ufb01cally focus on which response is more comprehensive in capturing the relevant values, rights, and duties for the given situation.System AAbout equal (try to avoid this answer unless necessary)System BWhich response do you prefer overall?Consider your answers to the previous questions, and follow your intuition for which system produced a better set of responses for the given situation.System AAbout equal (try to avoid this answer unless necessary)System BSystem A:${respa}System B:${respb} duties: Duties are the moral obligations or responsibilities that individuals owe to others or to society at large. They are categoricalreasons for doing or refraining from doing something, independent of whether we want to do or refrain from doing that thing.Duties can be weighty reasons, not easily overridden by competing concerns, and their violation may justify blame and self-blame(guilt). Duties can arise from relationships, social roles, or moral principles, and they guide our actions and decisions.You will be asked to compare 2 AI systems, system A and system B across 3 dimensions: When possible, avoiding saying that the two systems are equal for each dimension, try to pick one or the other. Correctness: Which system provides a more accurate list of responses? For example, if system A contains more errors, orresponses that are not relevant to the given situation, then you should select system B as the winner. Overall Preference: Following your intuition as a human, which of the two systems does a better job at producing values, rights,and duties for the given situation? Do not overthink this question, just follow your gut. Completeness: Which system provides a more comprehensive list of responses? You should ignore correctness when answeringthis questions, and only consider which system covers more of the important values, rights, and duties that are relevant to thesituation.
