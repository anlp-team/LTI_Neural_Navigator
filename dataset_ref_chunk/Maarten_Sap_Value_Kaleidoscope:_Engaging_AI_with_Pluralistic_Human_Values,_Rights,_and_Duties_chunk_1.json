Value pluralism is the view that multiple correct values may be held in tension with one another (e.g., when considering lying to a friend to protect their feelings, how does one balance honesty with friendship?). As statistical learners, AI systems fit to av- erages by default, washing out these potentially irreducible value conflicts. To improve AI systems to better reflect value pluralism, the first-order challenge is to explore the extent to which AI systems can model pluralistic human values, rights, and duties as well as their interaction. We introduce VALUEPRISM, a large-scale dataset of 218k values, rights, and duties connected to 31k human-written sit- uations. VALUEPRISM\u2019s contextualized values are generated by GPT-4 and deemed high-quality by human annotators 91% of the time. We conduct a large-scale study with annotators across diverse social and demographic backgrounds to try to understand whose values are represented. With VALUEPRISM, we build VALUE KALEIDOSCOPE (or KALEIDO), an open, light-weight, and structured language- based multi-task model that generates, explains, and assesses the relevance and valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human values, rights, and duties within a specific context. Humans prefer the sets of values output by our system over the teacher GPT-4, finding them more accurate and with broader cov- erage. In addition, we demonstrate that KALEIDO can help explain variability in human decision-making by outputting contrasting values. Finally, we show that KALEIDO\u2019s repre- sentations can transfer to other philosophical frameworks and datasets, confirming the benefit of an explicit, modular, and interpretable approach to value pluralism. We hope that our work will serve as a step to making more explicit the im- plicit values behind human decision-making and to steering AI systems to make decisions that are more in accordance with them.

Value pluralism is the view that multiple correct values may be held in tension with one another (e.g., when considering lying to a friend to protect their feelings, how does one balance honesty with friendship?). As statistical learners, AI systems fit to av- erages by default, washing out these potentially irreducible value conflicts. To improve AI systems to better reflect value pluralism, the first-order challenge is to explore the extent to which AI systems can model pluralistic human values, rights, and duties as well as their interaction. We introduce VALUEPRISM, a large-scale dataset of 218k values, rights, and duties connected to 31k human-written sit- uations. VALUEPRISM\u2019s contextualized values are generated by GPT-4 and deemed high-quality by human annotators 91% of the time. We conduct a large-scale study with annotators across diverse social and demographic backgrounds to try to understand whose values are represented. With VALUEPRISM, we build VALUE KALEIDOSCOPE (or KALEIDO), an open, light-weight, and structured language- based multi-task model that generates, explains, and assesses the relevance and valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human values, rights, and duties within a specific context. Humans prefer the sets of values output by our system over the teacher GPT-4, finding them more accurate and with broader cov- erage. In addition, we demonstrate that KALEIDO can help explain variability in human decision-making by outputting contrasting values. Finally, we show that KALEIDO\u2019s repre- sentations can transfer to other philosophical frameworks and datasets, confirming the benefit of an explicit, modular, and interpretable approach to value pluralism. We hope that our work will serve as a step to making more explicit the im- plicit values behind human decision-making and to steering AI systems to make decisions that are more in accordance with them.

Value pluralism is the view that multiple correct values may be held in tension with one another (e.g., when considering lying to a friend to protect their feelings, how does one balance honesty with friendship?). As statistical learners, AI systems fit to av- erages by default, washing out these potentially irreducible value conflicts. To improve AI systems to better reflect value pluralism, the first-order challenge is to explore the extent to which AI systems can model pluralistic human values, rights, and duties as well as their interaction. We introduce VALUEPRISM, a large-scale dataset of 218k values, rights, and duties connected to 31k human-written sit- uations. VALUEPRISM\u2019s contextualized values are generated by GPT-4 and deemed high-quality by human annotators 91% of the time. We conduct a large-scale study with annotators across diverse social and demographic backgrounds to try to understand whose values are represented. With VALUEPRISM, we build VALUE KALEIDOSCOPE (or KALEIDO), an open, light-weight, and structured language- based multi-task model that generates, explains, and assesses the relevance and valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human values, rights, and duties within a specific context. Humans prefer the sets of values output by our system over the teacher GPT-4, finding them more accurate and with broader cov- erage. In addition, we demonstrate that KALEIDO can help explain variability in human decision-making by outputting contrasting values. Finally, we show that KALEIDO\u2019s repre- sentations can transfer to other philosophical frameworks and datasets, confirming the benefit of an explicit, modular, and interpretable approach to value pluralism. We hope that our work will serve as a step to making more explicit the im- plicit values behind human decision-making and to steering AI systems to make decisions that are more in accordance with them.
