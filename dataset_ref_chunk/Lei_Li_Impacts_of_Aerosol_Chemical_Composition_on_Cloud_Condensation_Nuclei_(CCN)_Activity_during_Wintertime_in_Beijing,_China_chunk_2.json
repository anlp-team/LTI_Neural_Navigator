To obtain regional parameters for aerosol particle activation, numerous \ufb01eld cam- paigns have been conducted globally. Alongside the considerable spatial heterogeneity, temporal variability in aerosol activation characteristics is also essential for accurate CCN prediction [7]. The CCN activity can be characterized by two important parameters: activa- tion critical diameter (D50) and activation ratio (AR). These two parameters can be directly measured through combining cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNc) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) [24,25], and can also be determined by aerosol chemical composition and particle number size distribution (PNSD) measurements using the K\u00f6hler equation and internal mixture hypothesis [20,26\u201328]. The CCN activity closure analysis, based on the above two methods, is a key means of investigating the impacts of aerosol properties on activation processes. Although CCN measurements were conducted under different environments in the North China Plain, only a few studies established a linkage between CCN activity and chemical composition with a high time resolution [27,29\u201331]. Additionally, due to the Clean Air Action of the Chinese government initiated in 2013, stringent emission controls have been imposed to decrease \ufb01ne particulate matter pollution (PM2.5, particles smaller than 2.5 \u00b5m in diameter) [32]. In the Beijing region, notable reduc- tions in PM2.5 concentration over the past decade have been accompanied by signi\ufb01cant changes in its chemical composition [33\u201335]. Instead of organics and sulfate, organics and nitrate are now the dominant components of Beijing winter haze pollution. Therefore, more investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN activity in urban Beijing. 2 of 15 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 In this study, the CCN activity and aerosol chemical composition were simultaneously measured in Beijing wintertime, using a scanning mobility CCN analyzer (SMCA) and an Aerodyne aerosol chemical species monitor (ACSM). An overview of the observation data is presented in Section Overview the Observation Data. The impacts of aerosol chemical composition and mixing state on CCN activity are discussed in Section 4.1. Finally, in Section 4.2, through closure analysis of the aerosol hygroscopicity derived from CCN activity and chemical composition, we estimate \u03baorg and parameterize it with the concentration ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC). 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Measurement Site Measurements of size-resolved CCN activity, aerosol size distribution and composition (organics, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, chloride, and black carbon) were conducted on the rooftop of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS) building during the period of 15 January\u20133 March 2022. All aerosol measurements were performed downstream of a PM10 impactor. The ambient air passes through the impactor and then enters the automatic regenerating adsorption aerosol dryer (TROPOS, Leipzig, Germany), which can dry the sample air to a low RH (RH < 30%) to ensure comparability of measurements [36]. The measurement site (116\u25e619(cid:48)E, 39\u25e657(cid:48)N, approximately 53 m above the ground) is located in a traf\ufb01c-intensive area of the west 3rd ring road in Beijing, China, which represents the urban environment in\ufb02uenced by intense anthropogenic emissions [37,38]. 2.2. Instrumentation 2.2.1. Size-Resolved CCN Activity and PNSD Measurements Size-resolved CCN spectra and activation ratios were measured using the SMCA initially proposed by Moore et al. (2010) [39]. In this work, the SMCA consisted of a CCNc- 100 (DMT Inc., Blouder, CO, USA), a differential mobility analyzer (DMA, model 3081, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA), and a condensation particle counter (CPC, model 3772, TSI Inc.). In the SMCA system, the combined DMA and CPC were used as a SMPS during the measurements. The dry particles after the diffusion dryer were neutralized by the X-ray neutralizer and were subsequently classi\ufb01ed by the DMA in a scanning mode. Then, the particles were split into two streams: one to the CPC for measurement of total particle number concentration (NCN) and another to the CCNc-100 for measurements of the CCN number concentration (NCCN). The \ufb02ow rates of the CPC and CCNc-100 were 1.0 L min\u22121 and 0.5 L min\u22121, respectively. With the total sample \ufb02ow of 1.5 L min\u22121 and sheath \ufb02ow of 7.5 L min\u22121, the SMCA was protocolled to measure particles at a mobility diameter range of 8\u2013360 nm. The DMA was operated in scanning mode with a time resolution of 180 s, including a scan time of 165 s and a retrace time of 15 s. The supersaturation in the CCNc-100 was set to be 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, respectively, with a time interval of 9 min (corresponding to three diameter scans of the DMA) for each SS during the experiment. Only the second scan for each SS is used as the CCNc needs time for SS stabilization. Therefore, a complete SS cycle lasted ~0.5 h. The CCNc-100 was regularly calibrated with ammonium sulfate particles at the four SSs (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.7%). 2.2.2. Aerosol Chemical Composition Measurement Non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM) including sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organics with dry aerodynamic diameters below 2.5 \u00b5m was measured by an ACSM equipped with a PM2.5 aerodynamic lens at 10 min time resolution. The ACSM data were analyzed using standard data analysis software (Tofware v2.5.13). The collection ef\ufb01ciency (CE), which accounts for particle loss due to bouncing off the standard vaporizer, was derived from composition-dependent calculation following the algorithms proposed by Middlebrook et al. (2012) [40]. The calibrations of ionization ef\ufb01ciency (IE) and relative ion- ization ef\ufb01ciencies (RIEs) followed the standard procedures described in previous studies by using 300\u2013350 nm pure ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate particles [41,42]. The 3 of 15 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 RIE values used for organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride were 1.4, 1.2, 1.1, 3.4, and 1.3, respectively. Equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass was measured with an aethalometer (AE33, MAGEE Scienti\ufb01c, Berkeley, CA, USA) at 1 min. The instruments used dual-dots con\ufb01gura- tion to auto-correct for the loading effect. The measured absorption was converted to BC mass using an apparent mass absorption cross section (MAC) of 7.7 m2"}, {"question": " How can the CCN activity be directly measured?,        answer: Through combining cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNc) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS).

Therefore, more investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN activity in urban Beijing. 2 of 15 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 In this study, the CCN activity and aerosol chemical composition were simultaneously measured in Beijing wintertime, using a scanning mobility CCN analyzer (SMCA) and an Aerodyne aerosol chemical species monitor (ACSM). An overview of the observation data is presented in Section Overview the Observation Data. The impacts of aerosol chemical composition and mixing state on CCN activity are discussed in Section 4.1. Finally, in Section 4.2, through closure analysis of the aerosol hygroscopicity derived from CCN activity and chemical composition, we estimate \u03baorg and parameterize it with the concentration ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC). 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Measurement Site Measurements of size-resolved CCN activity, aerosol size distribution and composition (organics, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, chloride, and black carbon) were conducted on the rooftop of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS) building during the period of 15 January\u20133 March 2022. All aerosol measurements were performed downstream of a PM10 impactor. The ambient air passes through the impactor and then enters the automatic regenerating adsorption aerosol dryer (TROPOS, Leipzig, Germany), which can dry the sample air to a low RH (RH < 30%) to ensure comparability of measurements [36]. The measurement site (116\u25e619(cid:48)E, 39\u25e657(cid:48)N, approximately 53 m above the ground) is located in a traf\ufb01c-intensive area of the west 3rd ring road in Beijing, China, which represents the urban environment in\ufb02uenced by intense anthropogenic emissions [37,38]. 2.2. Instrumentation 2.2.1. Size-Resolved CCN Activity and PNSD Measurements Size-resolved CCN spectra and activation ratios were measured using the SMCA initially proposed by Moore et al. (2010) [39]. In this work, the SMCA consisted of a CCNc- 100 (DMT Inc., Blouder, CO, USA), a differential mobility analyzer (DMA, model 3081, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA), and a condensation particle counter (CPC, model 3772, TSI Inc.). In the SMCA system, the combined DMA and CPC were used as a SMPS during the measurements. The dry particles after the diffusion dryer were neutralized by the X-ray neutralizer and were subsequently classi\ufb01ed by the DMA in a scanning mode. Then, the particles were split into two streams: one to the CPC for measurement of total particle number concentration (NCN) and another to the CCNc-100 for measurements of the CCN number concentration (NCCN). The \ufb02ow rates of the CPC and CCNc-100 were 1.0 L min\u22121 and 0.5 L min\u22121, respectively. With the total sample \ufb02ow of 1.5 L min\u22121 and sheath \ufb02ow of 7.5 L min\u22121, the SMCA was protocolled to measure particles at a mobility diameter range of 8\u2013360 nm. The DMA was operated in scanning mode with a time resolution of 180 s, including a scan time of 165 s and a retrace time of 15 s. The supersaturation in the CCNc-100 was set to be 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, respectively, with a time interval of 9 min (corresponding to three diameter scans of the DMA) for each SS during the experiment. Only the second scan for each SS is used as the CCNc needs time for SS stabilization. Therefore, a complete SS cycle lasted ~0.5 h. The CCNc-100 was regularly calibrated with ammonium sulfate particles at the four SSs (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.7%). 2.2.2. Aerosol Chemical Composition Measurement Non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM) including sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organics with dry aerodynamic diameters below 2.5 \u00b5m was measured by an ACSM equipped with a PM2.5 aerodynamic lens at 10 min time resolution. The ACSM data were analyzed using standard data analysis software (Tofware v2.5.13). The collection ef\ufb01ciency (CE), which accounts for particle loss due to bouncing off the standard vaporizer, was derived from composition-dependent calculation following the algorithms proposed by Middlebrook et al. (2012) [40]. The calibrations of ionization ef\ufb01ciency (IE) and relative ion- ization ef\ufb01ciencies (RIEs) followed the standard procedures described in previous studies by using 300\u2013350 nm pure ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate particles [41,42]. The 3 of 15 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 RIE values used for organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride were 1.4, 1.2, 1.1, 3.4, and 1.3, respectively. Equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass was measured with an aethalometer (AE33, MAGEE Scienti\ufb01c, Berkeley, CA, USA) at 1 min. The instruments used dual-dots con\ufb01gura- tion to auto-correct for the loading effect. The measured absorption was converted to BC mass using an apparent mass absorption cross section (MAC) of 7.7 m2"}, {"question": " What is the purpose of the automatic regenerating adsorption aerosol dryer used in the measurements?,        answer: To dry the sample air to a low RH (RH < 30%) to ensure comparability of measurements.

To obtain regional parameters for aerosol particle activation, numerous \ufb01eld cam- paigns have been conducted globally. Alongside the considerable spatial heterogeneity, temporal variability in aerosol activation characteristics is also essential for accurate CCN prediction [7]. The CCN activity can be characterized by two important parameters: activa- tion critical diameter (D50) and activation ratio (AR). These two parameters can be directly measured through combining cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNc) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) [24,25], and can also be determined by aerosol chemical composition and particle number size distribution (PNSD) measurements using the K\u00f6hler equation and internal mixture hypothesis [20,26\u201328]. The CCN activity closure analysis, based on the above two methods, is a key means of investigating the impacts of aerosol properties on activation processes. Although CCN measurements were conducted under different environments in the North China Plain, only a few studies established a linkage between CCN activity and chemical composition with a high time resolution [27,29\u201331]. Additionally, due to the Clean Air Action of the Chinese government initiated in 2013, stringent emission controls have been imposed to decrease \ufb01ne particulate matter pollution (PM2.5, particles smaller than 2.5 \u00b5m in diameter) [32].

In this work, the SMCA consisted of a CCNc- 100 (DMT Inc., Blouder, CO, USA), a differential mobility analyzer (DMA, model 3081, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA), and a condensation particle counter (CPC, model 3772, TSI Inc.). In the SMCA system, the combined DMA and CPC were used as a SMPS during the measurements. The dry particles after the diffusion dryer were neutralized by the X-ray neutralizer and were subsequently classi\ufb01ed by the DMA in a scanning mode. Then, the particles were split into two streams: one to the CPC for measurement of total particle number concentration (NCN) and another to the CCNc-100 for measurements of the CCN number concentration (NCCN). The \ufb02ow rates of the CPC and CCNc-100 were 1.0 L min\u22121 and 0.5 L min\u22121, respectively. With the total sample \ufb02ow of 1.5 L min\u22121 and sheath \ufb02ow of 7.5 L min\u22121, the SMCA was protocolled to measure particles at a mobility diameter range of 8\u2013360 nm. The DMA was operated in scanning mode with a time resolution of 180 s, including a scan time of 165 s and a retrace time of 15 s. The supersaturation in the CCNc-100 was set to be 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, respectively, with a time interval of 9 min (corresponding to three diameter scans of the DMA) for each SS during the experiment. Only the second scan for each SS is used as the CCNc needs time for SS stabilization. Therefore, a complete SS cycle lasted ~0.5 h. The CCNc-100 was regularly calibrated with ammonium sulfate particles at the four SSs (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.7%). 2.2.2. Aerosol Chemical Composition Measurement Non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM) including sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organics with dry aerodynamic diameters below 2.5 \u00b5m was measured by an ACSM equipped with a PM2.5 aerodynamic lens at 10 min time resolution. The ACSM data were analyzed using standard data analysis software (Tofware v2.5.13). The collection ef\ufb01ciency (CE), which accounts for particle loss due to bouncing off the standard vaporizer, was derived from composition-dependent calculation following the algorithms proposed by Middlebrook et al. (2012) [40]. The calibrations of ionization ef\ufb01ciency (IE) and relative ion- ization ef\ufb01ciencies (RIEs) followed the standard procedures described in previous studies by using 300\u2013350 nm pure ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate particles [41,42]. The 3 of 15 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 RIE values used for organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride were 1.4, 1.2, 1.1, 3.4, and 1.3, respectively. Equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass was measured with an aethalometer (AE33, MAGEE Scienti\ufb01c, Berkeley, CA, USA) at 1 min. The instruments used dual-dots con\ufb01gura- tion to auto-correct for the loading effect. The measured absorption was converted to BC mass using an apparent mass absorption cross section (MAC) of 7.7 m2"}, {"question": " How was the eBC mass measured?,        answer: Using an aethalometer (AE33) that measured absorption converted to BC mass using an apparent mass absorption cross section (MAC) of 7.7 m2.    ", "ref_chunk": "chemical composition, functional properties, and microphysical structure, consequently exerting distinct in\ufb02uences on \u03baorg and rendering single oxidation level parameters (such as O:C) unable to capture those differences [23]. To obtain regional parameters for aerosol particle activation, numerous \ufb01eld cam- paigns have been conducted globally. Alongside the considerable spatial heterogeneity, temporal variability in aerosol activation characteristics is also essential for accurate CCN prediction [7]. The CCN activity can be characterized by two important parameters: activa- tion critical diameter (D50) and activation ratio (AR). These two parameters can be directly measured through combining cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNc) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) [24,25], and can also be determined by aerosol chemical composition and particle number size distribution (PNSD) measurements using the K\u00f6hler equation and internal mixture hypothesis [20,26\u201328]. The CCN activity closure analysis, based on the above two methods, is a key means of investigating the impacts of aerosol properties on activation processes. Although CCN measurements were conducted under different environments in the North China Plain, only a few studies established a linkage between CCN activity and chemical composition with a high time resolution [27,29\u201331]. Additionally, due to the Clean Air Action of the Chinese government initiated in 2013, stringent emission controls have been imposed to decrease \ufb01ne particulate matter pollution (PM2.5, particles smaller than 2.5 \u00b5m in diameter) [32]. In the Beijing region, notable reduc- tions in PM2.5 concentration over the past decade have been accompanied by signi\ufb01cant changes in its chemical composition [33\u201335]. Instead of organics and sulfate, organics and nitrate are now the dominant components of Beijing winter haze pollution. Therefore, more investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN activity in urban Beijing. 2 of 15 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 In this study, the CCN activity and aerosol chemical composition were simultaneously measured in Beijing wintertime, using a scanning mobility CCN analyzer (SMCA) and an Aerodyne aerosol chemical species monitor (ACSM). An overview of the observation data is presented in Section Overview the Observation Data. The impacts of aerosol chemical composition and mixing state on CCN activity are discussed in Section 4.1. Finally, in Section 4.2, through closure analysis of the aerosol hygroscopicity derived from CCN activity and chemical composition, we estimate \u03baorg and parameterize it with the concentration ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC). 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Measurement Site Measurements of size-resolved CCN activity, aerosol size distribution and composition (organics, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, chloride, and black carbon) were conducted on the rooftop of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS) building during the period of 15 January\u20133 March 2022. All aerosol measurements were performed downstream of a PM10 impactor. The ambient air passes through the impactor and then enters the automatic regenerating adsorption aerosol dryer (TROPOS, Leipzig, Germany), which can dry the sample air to a low RH (RH < 30%) to ensure comparability of measurements [36].
