Southern Africa The comparisons of BC column concentration in the Southern Africa (SOA) region between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product are shown in Figure 14. Similar variations in monthly means for the regional BC column concentration are re-flected by both GRASP/Component retrievals and MERRA-2 products over the SOA re-gion. Specifically, GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC products present the highest concentration in August and September, while the lowest concentration is in March and April. A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.94) and low RMSE = 0.77 mg/m2 are obtained between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the SOA region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the SOA region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval in all months except July, August, and September when the biomass burning is strong. The maximum absolute difference of 1.0 mg/m2 was obtained in October, and the maximum relative difference of 55.8% was obtained in December.

Southern Africa The comparisons of BC column concentration in the Southern Africa (SOA) region be- tween GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product are shown in Figure 14. Similar variations in monthly means for the regional BC column concentration are re\ufb02ected by both GRASP/Component retrievals and MERRA-2 products over the SOA region. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC products present the highest concentration in August and September, while the lowest concentration is in March and April. A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.94) and low RMSE = 0.77 mg/m2 are obtained between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the SOA region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the SOA region, the"}
