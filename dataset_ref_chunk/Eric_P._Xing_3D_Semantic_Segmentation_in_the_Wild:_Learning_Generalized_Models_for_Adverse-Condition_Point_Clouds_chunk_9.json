Implementation details We provide the detailed training configurations for semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds that have been adopted as described in Sec. 5.1 of the submitted paper. Specifically, we implement the backbone model MinkowskiNet [7] with the TorchSparse library [42]. For training, we use SGD optimizer.

The momentum coefficient m is set at 0.99. We train 50 epochs with one NVIDIA 2080Ti with 11GB GPU memory and set the batch size at 4. The augmentations of training data in the source-domain are implemented as follows: For rotation, LiDAR points are rotated with the range of [0, 360\u25e6] along Z axis. For scale, the coordinates of LiDAR points are randomly scaled within [0.95, 1.05].

A. Domain generalization A.1. Implementation details We provide the detailed training configurations for semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds that have been adopted as described in Sec. 5.1 of the submitted paper. Specifically, we implement the backbone model MinkowskiNet [7] with the TorchSparse library [42]. For training, we use SGD optimizer. The learning rate, momentum and weight decays are set as 0.24, 0.9, and 1.4e \u2212 4, respectively. \u03c4 in Eq. 1 in the paper is set as 0.07 [17, 49] and \u03bbct in Eq. 2 is set as 0.1. The momentum coefficient m is set at 0.99. We train 50 epochs with one NVIDIA 2080Ti with 11GB GPU memory and set the batch size at 4. The augmentations of training data in the source-domain are implemented as follows: For rotation, LiDAR points are rotated with the range of [0, 360\u25e6] along Z axis. For scale, the coordinates of LiDAR points are randomly scaled within [0.95, 1.05].

A. Domain generalization A.1. Implementation details We provide the detailed training configurations for semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds that have been adopted as described in Sec. 5.1 of the submitted paper. Specifically, we implement the backbone model MinkowskiNet [7] with the TorchSparse library [42]. For training, we use SGD optimizer. The learning rate, momentum and weight decays are set as 0.24, 0.9, and 1.4e \u2212 4, respectively. \u03c4 in Eq. 1 in the paper is set as 0.07 [17, 49] and \u03bbct in Eq. 2 is set as 0.1. The momentum coefficient m is set at 0.99. We train 50 epochs with one NVIDIA 2080Ti with 11GB GPU memory and set the batch size at 4. The augmentations of training data in the source-domain are implemented as follows: For rotation, LiDAR points are rotated with the range of [0, 360\u25e6] along Z axis. For scale, the coordinates of LiDAR points are randomly scaled within [0.95, 1.05]. For drop-out, we randomly drop-out 0-20% points of"}, {"question": " What is the dataset introduced in the paper by Fisher Yu et al.?", "answer": " Bdd100k: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning", "ref_chunk": "Proceedings of the IEEE confer- ence on computer vision and pattern recognition workshops, pages 969\u2013977, 2018. 4 [46] Eric Tzeng, Judy Hoffman, Kate Saenko, and Trevor Darrell.

Confidence regularized self-training. Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 5982\u20135991, 2019. 7, 8, 14, 15 We provide more experiment details of domain adaptation and domain generalization in Section A and Section B, respec- tively, supervised learning on adverse conditions in Section C and additional details on SemanticSTF dataset in Section D. A. Domain generalization A.1. Implementation details We provide the detailed training configurations for semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds that have been adopted as described in Sec. 5.1 of the submitted paper. Specifically, we implement the backbone model MinkowskiNet [7] with the TorchSparse library [42]. For training, we use SGD optimizer. The learning rate, momentum and weight decays are set as 0.24, 0.9, and 1.4e \u2212 4, respectively. \u03c4 in Eq. 1 in the paper is set as 0.07 [17, 49] and \u03bbct in Eq. 2 is set as 0.1. The momentum coefficient m is set at 0.99. We train 50 epochs with one NVIDIA 2080Ti with 11GB GPU memory and set the batch size at 4. The augmentations of training data in the source-domain are implemented as follows: For rotation, LiDAR points are rotated with the range of [0, 360\u25e6] along Z axis. For scale, the coordinates of LiDAR points are randomly scaled within [0.95, 1.05]. For drop-out, we randomly drop-out 0-20% points of"}
