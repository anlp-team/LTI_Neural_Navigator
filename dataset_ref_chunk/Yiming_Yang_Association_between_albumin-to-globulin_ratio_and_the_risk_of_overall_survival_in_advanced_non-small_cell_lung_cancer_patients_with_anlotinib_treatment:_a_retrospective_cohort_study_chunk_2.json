In addition, patients who met the exclusion criteria as fol- lows: (a) Patients without available follow-up data and records; (b) Patients treated with anlotinib for less than one cycle (12 mg, 10 mg or 8 mg once daily, 2 weeks on/ 1 week off ); (c) Patients were not at clinical stage III and IV (d) Patients with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) score higher than one, were not included in the final analysis. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, clini- copathological characteristics, gene mutations, distant metastases, previous treatment information and com- plete follow-up information were extracted from medical records or obtained from telephone follow-up. Labora- tory values, including serum albumin and total protein, were collected at baseline within a week prior to the first dose of anlotinib. The AGR value was defined as serum albumin / (serum total protein - serum albumin), as previously described [16]. OS was defined as the period from the date of ini- tial treatment with anlotinib to death or the last follow- up. Patient without smoking history was defined as never smoker. Clinical stages were determined by IASLC (International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer) 8th edition lung cancer staging system. Informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. The cutoff data for patients\u2019 follow-up was November 1, 2021. Statistical analysis The first step of data analysis was to present the baseline data distribution of patients enrolled in this study in dif- ferent AGR groups (Tertile). We expressed continuous Page 3 of 10 variables as means \u00b1 standard deviations (normal distri- bution) or medians (quartile) (skewed distribution). We expressed categorical variables as frequencies or per- centages. We used chi-square test (categorical variables), One-Way ANOVA (normal distribution) and Kruskal- Wallis H (skewed distribution) to calculate the differ- ences among different AGR groups. The second step of data analysis could be summarized as follows: (a) Is there a relationship between AGR and OS, is it linear or non-linear? (b) What factors inter- fered with or modified the relationship between them? (c) What was the independent effect on AGR and OS when we exclude the effects of these potential confound- ers or modifiers? In accordance with the above analytical principles, univariate and multivariate linear regression models were used to assess the associations between AGR and OS. As suggested by the recommendations of STROBE statement [17], we built three models including an unadjusted model, a model adjusted to demographics and a fully-adjusted model. For the fully-adjusted model, the adjusted variables were correlated covariates that may influence OS and/or AGR as reported in previous studies [6, 14, 16]. In addition, the subgroup analyses were exe- cuted using stratified linear regression models after fully adjusted. Tests for effect modification by subgroups used the interaction terms between subgroup indicators, fol- lowed by the likelihood ratio test. OS among AGR tertiles was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log- rank tests. the two-piecewise linear model, and the linear model can be used to fit the relationship between AGR and OS. On the contrary, when the p value was less than 0.05, it is considered that the above-mentioned models were sig- nificantly different, and we used the two-piecewise linear model to clarify the relationship between AGR and OS. All the analyses were performed with the statistical software package R (http://www.R-project.org, The R Foundation) and EmpowerStats (http://www.empow- erstats.com, X&Y solutions, Inc., Boston, MA). P values less than 0.05 (two-side) were considered statistically significant. Results The enrollment of participants In total, 306 NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib were admitted to the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan Univer- sity between June 1, 2018 and June 1, 2021. Of these, 110 patients were excluded, including 10 patients who missed baseline data, 34 patients who lost to follow-up, 42 patients who were treated with anlotinib for less than one cycle, 23 patients with a high ECOG PS score (> 1) and 1 patient who was not at clinical stage III and IV. Finally, 196 selected participants were enrolled for data analysis (Fig. 1). Baseline clinical characteristics To ensure the robustness of the data analysis results, we conducted the following sensitivity analyses: (a) We converted the AGR into a categorical variable by tertile. The aim was to verify the results of AGR as a continu- ous variable and to observe the possibility of nonlinearity. (b) Linear regression is a linear model that is calculated based on the fact that the relationships between the inde- pendent variables and the dependent variables were lin- ear. However, the relationships between the dependent variables and the independent variables are often non- linear in biomedical data analysis. Thus, we used a gen- eralized additive model (GAM) to explore the nonlinear relationships. (c) If the relationship between AGR and OS is nonlinear, a two-piecewise linear regression model would be constructed to figure out the threshold effect of the AGR on OS according to the smoothing plot. A recur- sion algorithm was used to determine the saturation level of AGR, at which the relationship between AGR and OS began to change and became significant. The inflection point moved along a predefined interval and detected the inflection point that gave the maximum model like- lihood. We determined the best fit model based on the p value of log-likelihood ratio tests. When the p value of log-likelihood ratio tests was greater than 0.05, there is no difference between the linear regression model and The median follow-up time was 7.64 (range 0.59 to 32.98) months, and 97 patients died (49.49%).

Clinical stages were determined by IASLC (International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer) 8th edition lung cancer staging system. Informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. The cutoff data for patients\u2019 follow-up was November 1, 2021. Statistical analysis The first step of data analysis was to present the baseline data distribution of patients enrolled in this study in dif- ferent AGR groups (Tertile). We expressed continuous Page 3 of 10 variables as means \u00b1 standard deviations (normal distri- bution) or medians (quartile) (skewed distribution). We expressed categorical variables as frequencies or per- centages. We used chi-square test (categorical variables), One-Way ANOVA (normal distribution) and Kruskal- Wallis H (skewed distribution) to calculate the differ- ences among different AGR groups. The second step of data analysis could be summarized as follows: (a) Is there a relationship between AGR and OS, is it linear or non-linear? (b) What factors inter- fered with or modified the relationship between them? (c) What was the independent effect on AGR and OS when we exclude the effects of these potential confound- ers or modifiers? In accordance with the above analytical principles, univariate and multivariate linear regression models were used to assess the associations between AGR and OS. As suggested by the recommendations of STROBE statement [17], we built three models including an unadjusted model, a model adjusted to demographics and a fully-adjusted model. For the fully-adjusted model, the adjusted variables were correlated covariates that may influence OS and/or AGR as reported in previous studies [6, 14, 16]. In addition, the subgroup analyses were exe- cuted using stratified linear regression models after fully adjusted. Tests for effect modification by subgroups used the interaction terms between subgroup indicators, fol- lowed by the likelihood ratio test. OS among AGR tertiles was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log- rank tests. the two-piecewise linear model, and the linear model can be used to fit the relationship between AGR and OS. On the contrary, when the p value was less than 0.05, it is considered that the above-mentioned models were sig- nificantly different, and we used the two-piecewise linear model to clarify the relationship between AGR and OS. All the analyses were performed with the statistical software package R (http://www.R-project.org, The R Foundation) and EmpowerStats (http://www.empow- erstats.com, X&Y solutions, Inc., Boston, MA). P values less than 0.05 (two-side) were considered statistically significant. Results The enrollment of participants In total, 306 NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib were admitted to the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan Univer- sity between June 1, 2018 and June 1, 2021. Of these, 110 patients were excluded, including 10 patients who missed baseline data, 34 patients who lost to follow-up, 42 patients who were treated with anlotinib for less than one cycle, 23 patients with a high ECOG PS score (> 1) and 1 patient who was not at clinical stage III and IV. Finally, 196 selected participants were enrolled for data analysis (Fig. 1). Baseline clinical characteristics To ensure the robustness of the data analysis results, we conducted the following sensitivity analyses: (a) We converted the AGR into a categorical variable by tertile. The aim was to verify the results of AGR as a continu- ous variable and to observe the possibility of nonlinearity. (b) Linear regression is a linear model that is calculated based on the fact that the relationships between the inde- pendent variables and the dependent variables were lin- ear. However, the relationships between the dependent variables and the independent variables are often non- linear in biomedical data analysis. Thus, we used a gen- eralized additive model (GAM) to explore the nonlinear relationships. (c) If the relationship between AGR and OS is nonlinear, a two-piecewise linear regression model would be constructed to figure out the threshold effect of the AGR on OS according to the smoothing plot. A recur- sion algorithm was used to determine the saturation level of AGR, at which the relationship between AGR and OS began to change and became significant. The inflection point moved along a predefined interval and detected the inflection point that gave the maximum model like- lihood. We determined the best fit model based on the p value of log-likelihood ratio tests. When the p value of log-likelihood ratio tests was greater than 0.05, there is no difference between the linear regression model and The median follow-up time was 7.64 (range 0.59 to 32.98) months, and 97 patients died (49.49%). Baseline characteristics of selected participants according to ter- tile of AGR are shown in Table 1. In general, the aver- age age was 60.44 \u00b1 10.14 years old, and about 64.29% were male.

OS among AGR tertiles was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log- rank tests. the two-piecewise linear model, and the linear model can be used to fit the relationship between AGR and OS. On the contrary, when the p value was less than 0.05, it is considered that the above-mentioned models were sig- nificantly different, and we used the two-piecewise linear model to clarify the relationship between AGR and OS. All the analyses were performed with the statistical software package R (http://www.R-project.org, The R Foundation) and EmpowerStats (http://www.empow- erstats.com, X&Y solutions, Inc., Boston, MA). P values less than 0.05 (two-side) were considered statistically significant. Results The enrollment of participants In total, 306 NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib were admitted to the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan Univer- sity between June 1, 2018 and June 1, 2021. Of these, 110 patients were excluded, including 10 patients who missed baseline data, 34 patients who lost to follow-up, 42 patients who were treated with anlotinib for less than one cycle, 23 patients with a high ECOG PS score (> 1) and 1 patient who was not at clinical stage III and IV. Finally, 196 selected participants were enrolled for data analysis (Fig. 1). Baseline clinical characteristics To ensure the robustness of the data analysis results, we conducted the following sensitivity analyses: (a) We converted the AGR into a categorical variable by tertile. The aim was to verify the results of AGR as a continu- ous variable and to observe the possibility of nonlinearity. (b) Linear regression is a linear model that is calculated based on the fact that the relationships between the inde- pendent variables and the dependent variables were lin- ear. However, the relationships between the dependent variables and the independent variables are often non- linear in biomedical data analysis. Thus, we used a gen- eralized additive model (GAM) to explore the nonlinear relationships. (c) If the relationship between AGR and OS is nonlinear, a two-piecewise linear regression model would be constructed to figure out the threshold effect of the AGR on OS according to the smoothing plot. A recur- sion algorithm was used to determine the saturation level of AGR, at which the relationship between AGR and OS began to change and became significant. The inflection point moved along a predefined interval and detected the inflection point that gave the maximum model like- lihood. We determined the best fit model based on the p value of log-likelihood ratio tests. When the p value of log-likelihood ratio tests was greater than 0.05, there is no difference between the linear regression model and The median follow-up time was 7.64 (range 0.59 to 32.98) months, and 97 patients died (49.49%). Baseline characteristics of selected participants according to ter- tile of AGR are shown in Table 1. In general, the aver- age age was 60.44 \u00b1 10.14 years old, and about 64.29% were male. No statistically significant differences were detected in neutrophil, gender, never smoker, hyperten- sion, ALK rearrangement, EGFR mutation, tumor stage, ECOG PS score, number"}
