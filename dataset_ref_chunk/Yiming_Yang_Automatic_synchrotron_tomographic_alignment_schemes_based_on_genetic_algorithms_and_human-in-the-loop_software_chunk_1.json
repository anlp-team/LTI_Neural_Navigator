To avoid spending a signi\ufb01cant amount of human effort and beam time on aligning the X-ray probe, sample and detector for data acquisition, most attention has been drawn to realigning the systems at the data processing stages.

Introduction In order to image a larger sample volume while retaining high spatial resolution, scanning tomography methods are becoming increasingly popular (Rawson et al., 2020; Sakdi- nawat & Attwood, 2010; Withers et al., 2021; Withers, 2007) at synchrotrons. Scanning tomography experiments usually involve multi-dimensional scans across the sample coupled with multimodal characterizations using X-ray beams with seek to incorporate various small synchrotron techniques like X-ray \ufb02uorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near-edge struc- ture (XANES), ptychography, etc. in scanning tomography experiments to correlate the local chemical, phase, strain, oxidation states and other functional properties with the structure of advanced materials (Liu et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2021; Vojtova\u00b4 et al., 2019; Kodama et al., 2021; Mu\u00a8 ller et al., 2021), hence providing a deeper under- standing of structure\u2013function relationships. For experiments carried out in micro- or nanoprobe beamlines, the amount of time necessary to collect a full dataset composed of hundreds of thousands of scan points is quite signi\ufb01cant (Sasov, 2004). Therefore, the majority of the experiments performed at current third-generation light sources are limited to static characterization. At present, the main reason for the long scan times is the relatively low beam intensities. While diffraction-limited storage rings will bring game-changing spot sizes. Scientists https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600577522011067 169 research papers brilliant sources to speed up the acquisition process and potentially meet the demand of dynamic or operando studies, the inconvenience of achieving a \ufb01ne alignment between the X-ray probe and the examined sample (Fig. 1) may also be a major limiting factor in accelerating the whole acquisition process. Generally, a 2D raster scan will be carried out at each projection and then the process is identical to the full-\ufb01eld imaging methods with the sample stage rotating to different angles. To satisfy the tomography reconstruction require- ments, the raster scan region needs to be capable of covering the sample area at all projections. While for full-\ufb01eld tomo- graphy the sample is not necessarily required to be precisely aligned to the center of the \ufb01eld of view, in scanning tomo- graphy experiments a bad alignment of the sample with the rotation center means an enlarged area needs to be scanned at each projection, thereby causing unnecessary time loss. Unlike the straightforward alignment process directly from projection images in full-\ufb01eld imaging (Ma et al., 2018), the alignment of the sample with respect to the rotation center in scanning tomography is usually far more complicated. Currently scientists are mainly relying on in-line microscopes to conduct the alignment coarse alignment at beamlines. However, accuracy using microscopes will not meet future scanning tomography experimental demands as the probe size reaches the nanometer range. A precise alignment should be based on the functional projection images acquired from real-time analysis of XRF, XRD and ptychography signals etc. Due to the complex alignment procedure and poor resolution of the composed projection image, a more automated and intelligent alignment method needs to be developed to cater to the \ufb01ne alignment requirements of future scanning tomography experiments. Although adding a layer of complexity, the obtained XRF, XRD and ptychography data from each projection can be automatically processed in real time using custom processing pipelines. The remaining alignment process of the scanning tomography will be based on 2D projection images, which shares great similarity with full-\ufb01eld tomography. Hence, alignment methods developed for full-\ufb01eld tomography can also be applied to scanning tomography experiments. In general, the tomographic alignment includes rotation-axis alignment and sample alignment with respect to the center of rotation (CoR) (Dong et al., 2013; Donath et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2015). For both scanning and full-\ufb01eld tomography, the rotation axis needs to be precisely aligned to be perpendicular to the incoming beam direction and parallel to the detector plane.

At present, the main reason for the long scan times is the relatively low beam intensities. While diffraction-limited storage rings will bring game-changing spot sizes.

Generally, a 2D raster scan will be carried out at each projection and then the process is identical to the full-\ufb01eld imaging methods with the sample stage rotating to different angles. To satisfy the tomography reconstruction require- ments, the raster scan region needs to be capable of covering the sample area at all projections. While for full-\ufb01eld tomo- graphy the sample is not necessarily required to be precisely aligned to the center of the \ufb01eld of view, in scanning tomo- graphy experiments a bad alignment of the sample with the rotation center means an enlarged area needs to be scanned at each projection, thereby causing unnecessary time loss. Unlike the straightforward alignment process directly from projection images in full-\ufb01eld imaging (Ma et al., 2018), the alignment of the sample with respect to the rotation center in scanning tomography is usually far more complicated. Currently scientists are mainly relying on in-line microscopes to conduct the alignment coarse alignment at beamlines. However, accuracy using microscopes will not meet future scanning tomography experimental demands as the probe size reaches the nanometer range. A precise alignment should be based on the functional projection images acquired from real-time analysis of XRF, XRD and ptychography signals etc. Due to the complex alignment procedure and poor resolution of the composed projection image, a more automated and intelligent alignment method needs to be developed to cater to the \ufb01ne alignment requirements of future scanning tomography experiments. Although adding a layer of complexity, the obtained XRF, XRD and ptychography data from each projection can be automatically processed in real time using custom processing pipelines. The remaining alignment process of the scanning tomography will be based on 2D projection images, which shares great similarity with full-\ufb01eld tomography. Hence, alignment methods developed for full-\ufb01eld tomography can also be applied to scanning tomography experiments. In general, the tomographic alignment includes rotation-axis alignment and sample alignment with respect to the center of rotation (CoR) (Dong et al., 2013; Donath et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2015). For both scanning and full-\ufb01eld tomography, the rotation axis needs to be precisely aligned to be perpendicular to the incoming beam direction and parallel to the detector plane.

Introduction In order to image a larger sample volume while retaining high spatial resolution, scanning tomography methods are becoming increasingly popular (Rawson et al., 2020; Sakdi- nawat & Attwood, 2010; Withers et al., 2021; Withers, 2007) at synchrotrons. Scanning tomography experiments usually involve multi-dimensional scans across the sample coupled with multimodal characterizations using X-ray beams with seek to incorporate various small synchrotron techniques like X-ray \ufb02uorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near-edge struc- ture (XANES), ptychography, etc. in scanning tomography experiments to correlate the local chemical, phase, strain, oxidation states and other functional properties with the structure of advanced materials (Liu et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2021; Vojtova\u00b4 et al., 2019; Kodama et al., 2021; Mu\u00a8 ller et al., 2021), hence providing a deeper under- standing of structure\u2013function relationships.

To achieve this goal, small probe size and multi-dimensional scanning schemes are utilized more often in the beamlines, leading to rising complexities and challenges in the experimental setup process. To avoid spending a signi\ufb01cant amount of human effort and beam time on aligning the X-ray probe, sample and detector for data acquisition, most attention has been drawn to realigning the systems at the data processing stages. However, post- processing cannot correct everything, and is not time ef\ufb01cient. Here we present automatic alignment schemes of the rotational axis and sample pre- and during the data acquisition process using a software approach which combines the advantages of genetic algorithms and human intelligence. Our approach shows excellent sub-pixel alignment ef\ufb01ciency for both tasks in a short time, and therefore holds great potential for application in the data acquisition systems of future scanning tomography experiments. 1. Introduction In order to image a larger sample volume while retaining high spatial resolution, scanning tomography methods are becoming increasingly popular (Rawson et al., 2020; Sakdi- nawat & Attwood, 2010; Withers et al., 2021; Withers, 2007) at synchrotrons. Scanning tomography experiments usually involve multi-dimensional scans across the sample coupled with multimodal characterizations using X-ray beams with seek to incorporate various small synchrotron techniques like X-ray \ufb02uorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near-edge struc- ture (XANES), ptychography, etc. in scanning tomography experiments to correlate the local chemical, phase, strain, oxidation states and other functional properties with the structure of advanced materials (Liu et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2021; Vojtova\u00b4 et al., 2019; Kodama et al., 2021; Mu\u00a8 ller et al., 2021), hence providing a deeper under- standing of structure\u2013function relationships. For experiments carried out in micro- or nanoprobe beamlines, the amount of time necessary to collect a full dataset composed of hundreds of thousands of scan points is quite signi\ufb01cant (Sasov, 2004). Therefore, the majority of the experiments performed at current third-generation light sources are limited to static characterization. At present, the main reason for the long scan times is the relatively low beam intensities. While diffraction-limited storage rings will bring game-changing spot sizes.

Generally, a 2D raster scan will be carried out at each projection and then the process is identical to the full-\ufb01eld imaging methods with the sample stage rotating to different angles. To satisfy the tomography reconstruction require- ments, the raster scan region needs to be capable of covering the sample area at all projections. While for full-\ufb01eld tomo- graphy the sample is not necessarily required to be precisely aligned to the center of the \ufb01eld of view, in scanning tomo- graphy experiments a bad alignment of the sample with the rotation center means an enlarged area needs to be scanned at each projection, thereby causing unnecessary time loss. Unlike the straightforward alignment process directly from projection images in full-\ufb01eld imaging (Ma et al., 2018), the alignment of the sample with respect to the rotation center in scanning tomography is usually far more complicated. Currently scientists are mainly relying on in-line microscopes to conduct the alignment coarse alignment at beamlines. However, accuracy using microscopes will not meet future scanning tomography experimental demands as the probe size reaches the nanometer range. A precise alignment should be based on the functional projection images acquired from real-time analysis of XRF, XRD and ptychography signals etc. Due to the complex alignment procedure and poor resolution of the composed projection image, a more automated and intelligent alignment method needs to be developed to cater to the \ufb01ne alignment requirements of future scanning tomography experiments. Although adding a layer of complexity, the obtained XRF, XRD and ptychography data from each projection can be automatically processed in real time using custom processing pipelines. The remaining alignment process of the scanning tomography will be based on 2D projection images, which shares great similarity with full-\ufb01eld tomography. Hence, alignment methods developed for full-\ufb01eld tomography can also be applied to scanning tomography experiments. In general, the tomographic alignment includes rotation-axis alignment and sample alignment with respect to the center of rotation (CoR) (Dong et al., 2013; Donath et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2015). For both scanning and full-\ufb01eld tomography, the rotation axis needs to be precisely aligned to be perpendicular to the incoming beam direction and parallel to the detector plane.
