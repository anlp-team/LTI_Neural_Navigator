Here, using a bias-corrected large ensemble of multi-model simulations under an envisioned post-pandemic green recovery, we find a general enhancement in solar PV over global land regions, especially in Asia, relative to the well-studied baseline scenario with modest climate change mitigation. Our results also show a notable west-to-east interhemispheric shift of wind energy by the mid-twenty-first century, under the two global carbon-neutral scenarios. Both solar PV and wind energy are projected to have a greater temporal stability in most land regions due to deep decarbonization. The co-benefits in enhancing and stabilizing renewable energy sources demonstrate a beneficial feedback in achieving global carbon neutrality and highlight Asian regions as a likely hotspot for renewable resources in future decades. Anthropogenic climate warming has led to more frequent climate extremes1\u20134 and pollution episodes5\u20137, which pose a serious threat to economy, ecological environment and human health8,9. To limit global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, global carbon neutrality must be achieved by the second half of the twenty-first cen- tury10. Achieving global carbon neutrality requires >50% reductions in anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by 203011,12, driven by an accelerated transition to renewable energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy are major drivers of clean energy transition; however, unlike nuclear or geothermal, their power outputs are sensitive to meteorological conditions13\u201316. Sunlight cap- tured by a PV module is influenced by solar altitude angle and sky condi- tion15. For example, clouds and aerosols can decrease sunlight reaching the ground by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, leading to smaller solar power yield17. In addition, high ambient temperature also reduces the conversion efficiency of solar panels18. The wind power yield is dominated by wind speed at the hub height (100\u2013150 m) of wind turbines19. Generally, neither smaller nor larger wind speed weathers are optimal to wind energy generation, because wind turbines (for example, Sinovel SL3000) typically start generating power at 3 m s\u22121, but need to shut down at 25 m s\u22121 for safety concerns20. Therefore, climate change projections provide key information for long-term planning and investment of solar and wind energy infra- structures. Many studies have assessed global or regional solar PV and wind energy, typically under the high-emission scenarios of the IPCC\u2019s Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)20\u201326.

To limit global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, global carbon neutrality must be achieved by the second half of the twenty-first cen- tury10. Achieving global carbon neutrality requires >50% reductions in anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by 203011,12, driven by an accelerated transition to renewable energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy are major drivers of clean energy transition; however, unlike nuclear or geothermal, their power outputs are sensitive to meteorological conditions13\u201316. Sunlight cap- tured by a PV module is influenced by solar altitude angle and sky condi- tion15. For example, clouds and aerosols can decrease sunlight reaching the ground by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, leading to smaller solar power yield17. In addition, high ambient temperature also reduces the conversion efficiency of solar panels18. The wind power yield is dominated by wind speed at the hub height (100\u2013150 m) of wind turbines19. Generally, neither smaller nor larger wind speed weathers are optimal to wind energy generation, because wind turbines (for example, Sinovel SL3000) typically start generating power at 3 m s\u22121, but need to shut down at 25 m s\u22121 for safety concerns20. Therefore, climate change projections provide key information for long-term planning and investment of solar and wind energy infra- structures.

Here, using a bias-corrected large ensemble of multi-model simulations under an envisioned post-pandemic green recovery, we find a general enhancement in solar PV over global land regions, especially in Asia, relative to the well-studied baseline scenario with modest climate change mitigation. Our results also show a notable west-to-east interhemispheric shift of wind energy by the mid-twenty-first century, under the two global carbon-neutral scenarios. Both solar PV and wind energy are projected to have a greater temporal stability in most land regions due to deep decarbonization. The co-benefits in enhancing and stabilizing renewable energy sources demonstrate a beneficial feedback in achieving global carbon neutrality and highlight Asian regions as a likely hotspot for renewable resources in future decades. Anthropogenic climate warming has led to more frequent climate extremes1\u20134 and pollution episodes5\u20137, which pose a serious threat to economy, ecological environment and human health8,9. To limit global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, global carbon neutrality must be achieved by the second half of the twenty-first cen- tury10. Achieving global carbon neutrality requires >50% reductions in anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by 203011,12, driven by an accelerated transition to renewable energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy are major drivers of clean energy transition; however, unlike nuclear or geothermal, their power outputs are sensitive to meteorological conditions13\u201316. Sunlight cap- tured by a PV module is influenced by solar altitude angle and sky condi- tion15. For example, clouds and aerosols can decrease sunlight reaching the ground by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, leading to smaller solar power yield17. In addition, high ambient temperature also reduces the conversion efficiency of solar panels18. The wind power yield is dominated by wind speed at the hub height (100\u2013150 m) of wind turbines19. Generally, neither smaller nor larger wind speed weathers are optimal to wind energy generation, because wind turbines (for example, Sinovel SL3000) typically start generating power at 3 m s\u22121, but need to shut down at 25 m s\u22121 for safety concerns20. Therefore, climate change projections provide key information for long-term planning and investment of solar and wind energy infra- structures. Many studies have assessed global or regional solar PV and wind energy, typically under the high-emission scenarios of the IPCC\u2019s Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)20\u201326.
