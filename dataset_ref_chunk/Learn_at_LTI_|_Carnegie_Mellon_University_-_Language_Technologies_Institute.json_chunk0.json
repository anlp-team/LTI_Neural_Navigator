We discourage the use of the \"TOEFL ITP Plus for China,\" since speaking is not scored.\n\nWe do not issue waivers for non-native speakers of English. In particular, we do not issue waivers based on previous study at a U.S. high school, college, or university. We also do not issue waivers based on previous study at an English-language high school, college, or university outside of the United States. No amount of educational experience in English, regardless of which country it occurred in, will result in a test waiver. Submit valid, recent scores: If as described above you are required to submit proof of English proficiency, your TOEFL, IELTS or Duolingo test scores will be considered valid as follows: If you have not received a bachelor\u2019s degree in the U.S., you will need to submit an English proficiency score no older than two years. (scores from exams taken before Sept. 1, 2021, will not be accepted.)\n\nIf you are currently working on or have received a bachelor's and/or a master's degree in the U.S., you may submit an expired test score up to five years old. (scores from exams taken before Sept. 1, 2018, will not be accepted.) Additional details about English proficiency requirements are provided on the FAQ page.\n\nOfficial transcripts from each university you have attended, regardless of whether you received your degree there.\n\nCurrent resume.\n\nStatement of Purpose.\n\nThree letters of recommendation.\n\nFor more details on these requirements, please see the SCS Master's Admissions page .\n\nIn addition to the SCS guidelines, the MIIS requires:\n\nA short (1-3 minute) video"}
