For particles larger than 150 nm, their number concentration showed no signi\ufb01cant changes during the periods of concentrated emissions, suggesting that local primary emissions had few in\ufb02uences on particle properties with this size range. Therefore, there were no signif-icant peaks observed in the diurnal variation in D50 at SS = 0.1%, which was generally larger than 150 nm during this campaign (Figure 3a). The mean value of PM2.5 mass concentration during this campaign is 25 \u00b5g m\u22123. Once the PM2.5 mass concentration exceeded this mean value, a period of pollution accumula-tion typically occurred for one to several days. Therefore, in order to further illustrate the impacts of aerosol chemical composition on CCN activity at the di\ufb00erent pollution levels, we de\ufb01ned the PM2.5 mass concentrations \u226425 \u00b5g m\u22123 and >25 \u00b5g m\u22123 as clean and polluted conditions, respectively. Note that the bulk aerosol composition measured by the ASCM is sensitive to larger particles, which contribute the majority of the total mass. Thus, the bulk composition tends to mainly re\ufb02ect the composition information for larger particles. Here, only the relationships between the fraction of each chemical component and D50 at SS = 0.1% are presented in Figure 4. Under the polluted conditions, the fraction of nitrate increased with PM2.5 concentrations and exhibited a negative correlation with D50 (r = \u22120.68), but no correlation between them (r = 0.02) under the clean conditions. In contrast, the fraction of sulfate only showed a correlation with D50 under the clean conditions (r = \u22120.47). These relationships indicated that as the concentration of PM2.5 increases, the dom-inant driver of CCN activity transitioned from sulfate to nitrate. Compared with the sec-ondary inorganic components, both the fractions of organics and BC showed a positive correlation with D50 due to their limited hygroscopicity. 0.3 190 200 200 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 16 120 120 Time (hour) Time (hour) Time (hour) Time (hour) Time (hour) Time (hour) 90D50 (nm) 0Fraction (%) 130 60 0.2 80 80 100Dp (nm) 18 18 18 18 18 18 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (e)OrgNO3SO4NH4ChlBC 90 150D50 (nm) 12 12 12 12 12 12 dN/dlogdp (# cm\u20133) 170 (d) 180 2000 (b) 6000 300 110 110 160 SS = 0.2% 100 100 100 8000 4000 (c) 210 40 0.1f44 (f) 6 6 6 6 6 6 SS = 0.1% 0.4 20 (a) Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4119 8 of 15 Figure 3.
