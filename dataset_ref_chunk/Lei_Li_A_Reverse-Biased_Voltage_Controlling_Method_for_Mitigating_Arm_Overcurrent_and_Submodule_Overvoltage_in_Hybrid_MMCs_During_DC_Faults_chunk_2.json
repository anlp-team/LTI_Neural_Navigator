Proposed Method to Limit the Arm Current According to the analysis of Section A, it can be known that the fast-changing of ac currents will cause large arm currents and FB-SM overvoltage. Thus, the problem can be solved by limiting the changing of ac currents. According to (3), decreasing the RBV in the same direction as the ac current (Varm2 in Fig. 1(c)) can limit the ac current. However, the effect of decreasing the RBV on the dc fault-clearing time should be considered as well.

According to (1), if the dc current of each arm is significantly larger than the ac current, the currents of the six arms will be in the same direction as the dc fault current. When the dc short- circuit fault is detected, all FB-SMs of the HMMC will be blocked to provide RBV to clear the dc fault current, as shown in Fig.1 (b).

Proposed Method to Limit the Arm Current According to the analysis of Section A, it can be known that the fast-changing of ac currents will cause large arm currents and FB-SM overvoltage. Thus, the problem can be solved by limiting the changing of ac currents. According to (3), decreasing the RBV in the same direction as the ac current (Varm2 in Fig. 1(c)) can limit the ac current. However, the effect of decreasing the RBV on the dc fault-clearing time should be considered as well. The dc fault current clearing time is affected by the decreasing rate of the dc fault current, which is decided by the voltage VL of the inductors (including arm inductor Larm and dc side inductor Ldc). dcLarmdcdd2iVtLL\u2212=+ .

After blocking all SMs, an ac short circuit will occur temporarily. The fast rise of ac current will affect arm currents. After a short current commutation process, the dc fault current will concentrate in one upper arm and one lower arm, which will increase the arm currents. Since the large arm currents will charge the blocked FB-SMs during the dc fault-clearing process, the FB-SM voltage of some arms may be extremely high. The arm overcurrent and FB-SM overvoltage during the dc fault- blocking process of the HMMC still need to be solved properly. is A reverse-biased voltage (RBV) control strategy proposed in this letter to limit the changing of ac currents after SM blocking. The RBV can be changed by controlling the number of blocked FB-SMs. By reducing the RBV in the same direction as the ac current, the ac currents can be limited. Thus, the maximum arm current stress and FB-SM voltage can be reduced. Besides, particular consideration is paid to limit increasing the dc fault clearing time. The main contributions of this work are: 1) it is the first time to eliminate arm overcurrent and submodule overvoltage based on RBV control, with proper management of the dc fault clearing time; 2) it provides a solution that is very friendly to real practical due to the simplicity of the method itself and no additional hardware required for its implementation. Simulation and experiment results are presented to validate the proposed method. changing of i1 at this stage. i1 will change quickly, which is equivalent to an ac short-circuit. ab1armacdd22uuitLL\u2212=+ . According to (1), some arm currents will rise, and others will decrease due to the rise of ac currents. The ac current will flow from the phase with the highest ac voltage to the phase with the lowest ac voltage, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Thus, the current of the upper arm of the phase with high ac voltage (iap in Fig. 1(b)) will rise, and the current of the lower arm with low ac voltage (icn in Fig. 1(b)) will rise. The currents of the other four arms will decrease. When the current of one arm decreases to zero, the voltage of this arm (Varm2 in Fig. 1(d)) will reverse, which will stop the changing of the ac current. Thus, the arm current will be kept at zero. Finally, the dc fault current will concentrate in the upper arm with the highest ac voltage and the lower arm with the lowest ac voltage. The current of the other arms will be small. After the dc fault current is concentrated in two arms, the maximum arm current becomes equal to the dc side fault current, as shown in Fig. 1(e). Since the amplitude of the dc fault current idcf is much larger than the rated ac currents iac, the arm currents will be increased by the rise of ac current during dc fault clearance.
