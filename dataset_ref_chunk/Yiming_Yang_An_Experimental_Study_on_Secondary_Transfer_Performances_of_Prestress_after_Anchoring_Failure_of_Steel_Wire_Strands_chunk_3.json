The Fast Corrosion Fracture an End Anchoring Position of Prestressed Tendons After curing for 28 days after grouting, local corrosion of the end anchoring position of S1\u2013S5 was performed via laboratory fast electrochemical corrosion. In this experiment, a 20 cm long local etch trench was designed, and it was \ufb01xed onto the end zone of the concrete component through structural adhesive. The trench contained 5% NaCl solution and a stainless steel plate. An anode wire with constant DC power was connected to the steel wire strand during corrosion, while the cathode wire was connected to the stainless-steel plate in the corrosion trench. Meanwhile, pouring NaCl solution into the trench formed a current loop. Under the action of the current, the steel wire strand at the anode was corroded (Figure 3). Only the corrosion of the strand end was considered during the experiment. To avoid the in\ufb02uence of corrosion on ordinary steel bars, epoxy resin was used as a coating during binding of the framework of the ordinary steel reinforcement for rust prevention. The whole experiment was carried out in an environment with a temperature of 20 \u25e6C and a humidity of 65%. The corrosion time of components was about 5 days. According to examination, this was consistent with the experimental design. Prestressed tendons all developed corrosion fracture at the end of the experiment (Figure 4). Figure 3. Corrosion layout of experimental components. Figure 4. End anchoring corrosion fracture of test specimens. Metals 2023, 13, 1489 3. Test Results and Analysis 3.1. Concept of Secondary Transfer of Residual Prestress The methods to apply prestress onto structures include the pre-tensioning method and the post-tensioning method, as shown in Figure 5. During the pre-tensioning of components, the wedge effect is caused by the Poisson effect during the expansion of the strand under the in\ufb02uence of effective prestress. At the same time, there is internal shrinkage and slip occurring in the steel strand. The above two phenomena lead to the secondary transfer of residual prestress. It is worth noting that since the steel strand\u2019s small diameter leads to an inconspicuous wedge effect, the prestress transfer is mainly caused by the bond effect between the concrete and the steel strand. Figure 5. Principle of prestress application: (a) pre-tensioning method, (b) post-tensioning method. For the post-tensioning prestressed components with end corrosion fracture, the stress at the fracture was zero due to the anchoring failure of the anchorage device. If concrete can provide enough bond force, the steel wire strand will generate a wedge effect, which is similar to the pre-tensioning components. Moreover, the steel wire strand will shrink and slip, thus causing the secondary transfer of residual prestress. 3.2. Strain Distribution After the breakage of the steel wire strand, the secondary transfer of residual prestress is accompanied by stress changes. Hence, stress changes at the fracture side of the steel wire strand specimens when the initial prestress was 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% were examined in this study. The results are shown in Figure 6. It can be seen from Figure 6 that with the increase in the corrosion rate, strains at the corrosion end of all of the specimens change violently. With the increase in the distance to the corrosion end, the strain decreases quickly. All specimens had the smallest strain changes at the third strain gauge, which tended to be zero. This might be because the good bonding between the steel wire strand and the concrete may lead to the secondary transfer of residual prestress after the fracture of the steel wire strand. The strain begins to increase at the fourth strain gauge. This demonstrates that prestress can undergo a secondary transfer in specimens after the fracture of the steel wire strand, but the effective prestress may decrease. The reasons for this are analyzed as follows. The end anchor plate and rope meter are both made of steel materials, and their elasticity moduli are far higher than that of concrete. When the strand stress at the corrosion side decreases, the concrete compressive strain in the local corrosion range is released, thus in\ufb02uencing the concrete stress distribution of the components. Due to the different elasticity modules between the concrete and the anchor plate, the relative strain generated by the concrete is higher than that of the anchor plate. To keep the coordination of the displacement between the concrete and the anchoring device at the non-corroded end, the anchor plate moves toward the corrosion end relative to the concrete. The length of the steel wire strand decreases and the effective prestress decreases, while the prestress loss increases. 6 of 19 Metals 2023, 13, 1489 Figure 6.

The Fast Corrosion Fracture an End Anchoring Position of Prestressed Tendons After curing for 28 days after grouting, local corrosion of the end anchoring position of S1\u2013S5 was performed via laboratory fast electrochemical corrosion. In this experiment, a 20 cm long local etch trench was designed, and it was \ufb01xed onto the end zone of the concrete component through structural adhesive. The trench contained 5% NaCl solution and a stainless steel plate. An anode wire with constant DC power was connected to the steel wire strand during corrosion, while the cathode wire was connected to the stainless-steel plate in the corrosion trench. Meanwhile, pouring NaCl solution into the trench formed a current loop. Under the action of the current, the steel wire strand at the anode was corroded (Figure 3). Only the corrosion of the strand end was considered during the experiment. To avoid the in\ufb02uence of corrosion on ordinary steel bars, epoxy resin was used as a coating during binding of the framework of the ordinary steel reinforcement for rust prevention. The whole experiment was carried out in an environment with a temperature of 20 \u25e6C and a humidity of 65%. The corrosion time of components was about 5 days. According to examination, this was consistent with the experimental design. Prestressed tendons all developed corrosion fracture at the end of the experiment (Figure 4). Figure 3. Corrosion layout of experimental components. Figure 4. End anchoring corrosion fracture of test specimens. Metals 2023, 13, 1489 3. Test Results and Analysis 3.1. Concept of Secondary Transfer of Residual Prestress The methods to apply prestress onto structures include the pre-tensioning method and the post-tensioning method, as shown in Figure 5. During the pre-tensioning of components, the wedge effect is caused by the Poisson effect during the expansion of the strand under the in\ufb02uence of effective prestress. At the same time, there is internal shrinkage and slip occurring in the steel strand. The above two phenomena lead to the secondary transfer of residual prestress. It is worth noting that since the steel strand\u2019s small diameter leads to an inconspicuous wedge effect, the prestress transfer is mainly caused by the bond effect between the concrete and the steel strand. Figure 5. Principle of prestress application: (a) pre-tensioning method, (b) post-tensioning method. For the post-tensioning prestressed components with end corrosion fracture, the stress at the fracture was zero due to the anchoring failure of the anchorage device. If concrete can provide enough bond force, the steel wire strand will generate a wedge effect, which is similar to the pre-tensioning components. Moreover, the steel wire strand will shrink and slip, thus causing the secondary transfer of residual prestress. 3.2. Strain Distribution After the breakage of the steel wire strand, the secondary transfer of residual prestress is accompanied by stress changes. Hence, stress changes at the fracture side of the steel wire strand specimens when the initial prestress was 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% were examined in this study. The results are shown in Figure 6. It can be seen from Figure 6 that with the increase in the corrosion rate, strains at the corrosion end of all of the specimens change violently. With the increase in the distance to the corrosion end, the strain decreases quickly. All specimens had the smallest strain changes at the third strain gauge, which tended to be zero. This might be because the good bonding between the steel wire strand and the concrete may lead to the secondary transfer of residual prestress after the fracture of the steel wire strand. The strain begins to increase at the fourth strain gauge. This demonstrates that prestress can undergo a secondary transfer in specimens after the fracture of the steel wire strand, but the effective prestress may decrease. The reasons for this are analyzed as follows. The end anchor plate and rope meter are both made of steel materials, and their elasticity moduli are far higher than that of concrete. When the strand stress at the corrosion side decreases, the concrete compressive strain in the local corrosion range is released, thus in\ufb02uencing the concrete stress distribution of the components. Due to the different elasticity modules between the concrete and the anchor plate, the relative strain generated by the concrete is higher than that of the anchor plate. To keep the coordination of the displacement between the concrete and the anchoring device at the non-corroded end, the anchor plate moves toward the corrosion end relative to the concrete. The length of the steel wire strand decreases and the effective prestress decreases, while the prestress loss increases. 6 of 19 Metals 2023, 13, 1489 Figure 6.

In the prestressing process, tension force was monitored with a rope meter, and elongation of the steel wire strand was recorded by a dial indicator. At 48 h after tension, the rope meter was read, and effective prestress applied onto components was measured in Table 3. Metals 2023, 13, 1489 5 of 19 Table 3.

The Fast Corrosion Fracture an End Anchoring Position of Prestressed Tendons After curing for 28 days after grouting, local corrosion of the end anchoring position of S1\u2013S5 was performed via laboratory fast electrochemical corrosion. In this experiment, a 20 cm long local etch trench was designed, and it was \ufb01xed onto the end zone of the concrete component through structural adhesive. The trench contained 5% NaCl solution and a stainless steel plate. An anode wire with constant DC power was connected to the steel wire strand during corrosion, while the cathode wire was connected to the stainless-steel plate in the corrosion trench. Meanwhile, pouring NaCl solution into the trench formed a current loop. Under the action of the current, the steel wire strand at the anode was corroded (Figure 3). Only the corrosion of the strand end was considered during the experiment. To avoid the in\ufb02uence of corrosion on ordinary steel bars, epoxy resin was used as a coating during binding of the framework of the ordinary steel reinforcement for rust prevention. The whole experiment was carried out in an environment with a temperature of 20 \u25e6C and a humidity of 65%. The corrosion time of components was about 5 days. According to examination, this was consistent with the experimental design. Prestressed tendons all developed corrosion fracture at the end of the experiment (Figure 4). Figure 3. Corrosion layout of experimental components. Figure 4. End anchoring corrosion fracture of test specimens. Metals 2023, 13, 1489 3. Test Results and Analysis 3.1. Concept of Secondary Transfer of Residual Prestress The methods to apply prestress onto structures include the pre-tensioning method and the post-tensioning method, as shown in Figure 5. During the pre-tensioning of components, the wedge effect is caused by the Poisson effect during the expansion of the strand under the in\ufb02uence of effective prestress. At the same time, there is internal shrinkage and slip occurring in the steel strand. The above two phenomena lead to the secondary transfer of residual prestress. It is worth noting that since the steel strand\u2019s small diameter leads to an inconspicuous wedge effect, the prestress transfer is mainly caused by the bond effect between the concrete and the steel strand. Figure 5. Principle of prestress application: (a) pre-tensioning method, (b) post-tensioning method. For the post-tensioning prestressed components with end corrosion fracture, the stress at the fracture was zero due to the anchoring failure of the anchorage device. If concrete can provide enough bond force, the steel wire strand will generate a wedge effect, which is similar to the pre-tensioning components. Moreover, the steel wire strand will shrink and slip, thus causing the secondary transfer of residual prestress. 3.2. Strain Distribution After the breakage of the steel wire strand, the secondary transfer of residual prestress is accompanied by stress changes. Hence, stress changes at the fracture side of the steel wire strand specimens when the initial prestress was 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% were examined in this study. The results are shown in Figure 6. It can be seen from Figure 6 that with the increase in the corrosion rate, strains at the corrosion end of all of the specimens change violently. With the increase in the distance to the corrosion end, the strain decreases quickly. All specimens had the smallest strain changes at the third strain gauge, which tended to be zero. This might be because the good bonding between the steel wire strand and the concrete may lead to the secondary transfer of residual prestress after the fracture of the steel wire strand. The strain begins to increase at the fourth strain gauge. This demonstrates that prestress can undergo a secondary transfer in specimens after the fracture of the steel wire strand, but the effective prestress may decrease. The reasons for this are analyzed as follows. The end anchor plate and rope meter are both made of steel materials, and their elasticity moduli are far higher than that of concrete. When the strand stress at the corrosion side decreases, the concrete compressive strain in the local corrosion range is released, thus in\ufb02uencing the concrete stress distribution of the components. Due to the different elasticity modules between the concrete and the anchor plate, the relative strain generated by the concrete is higher than that of the anchor plate. To keep the coordination of the displacement between the concrete and the anchoring device at the non-corroded end, the anchor plate moves toward the corrosion end relative to the concrete. The length of the steel wire strand decreases and the effective prestress decreases, while the prestress loss increases. 6 of 19 Metals 2023, 13, 1489 Figure 6.
