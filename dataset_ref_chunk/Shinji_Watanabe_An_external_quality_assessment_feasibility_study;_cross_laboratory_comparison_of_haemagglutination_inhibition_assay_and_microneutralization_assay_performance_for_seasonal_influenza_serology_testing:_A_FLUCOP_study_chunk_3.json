For normalization of titres, from the two serum standards (pools of post-vaccination serum as previously described) included in the panel, we selected the serum standard for which the greatest number of valid data were returned - sample no.17. For each run a calibration factor was calculated as the ratio of titre of sample no.17 in a run/the global GMT of sample no.17 (GMT across all testing runs/laboratories after data exclusion as described above). The calibration factor was then applied to all other titres within that run to calculate normalized titres. Each participant received a report giving an overview of all returned data, with laboratory speci\ufb01c information for the following: intra-assay variability (maximum-minimum duplicate sample ratios %>3.5 by subtype/lineage compared to the average across testing laboratories), intra-laboratory variability (maximum- frontiersin.org Waldock et al. minimum ratios of sample titres across runs %>3.5 by subtype/ lineage compared to the average across testing laboratories) and inter-laboratory variability (GMRs pre- and post- normalization by subtype/lineage compared to the average across testing laboratories). 3 Results 3.1 Returned data Of the 17 accepted participants 16 laboratories returned data by the study deadline. One participant dropped out of the study due to administrative issues. For HAI analysis 13 laboratories returned data. One laboratory was excluded as only a single replicate was carried out. Six laboratories carried out both FLUCOP and in-house HAI testing, giving 19 data sets in total. One laboratory carried out two runs (of both FLUCOP and in-house testing). Where two-three independent replicates were carried out, data was taken forward for analysis. For MN testing 8 laboratories returned data. Four laboratories carried out in-house testing, two laboratories used the WHO ELISA-based MN assay (hereafter designated FLU in \ufb01gures) and two laboratories carried out both in-house and the WHO ELISA-based MN assays, giving 10 data sets in total. It should be noted that laboratory 4 returned MN data for the B lineage viruses only, and laboratory 5 returned in-house MN data for the H3N2 in\ufb02uenza A virus only. 3.2 HAI testing results 3.2.1 Intra-assay variability We conducted an intra-assay (or within run) variability analysis by comparing the maximum to minimum ratio of 4 pairs of coded duplicates within the serum panel. Duplicate ratios of equal to or less than 2 (\u22642) were considered acceptable. In the data returned over 98% of duplicate ratios were \u22642 (73% of the ratios were =1 i.e. the duplicate samples had the same value). Intra-assay performance was good across all laboratories (with a small number of laboratories having higher incidence of duplicate ratios greater than 2) 3.2.2 Intra-laboratory variability We conducted an intra-laboratory (or between-run) variability analysis by comparing maximum to minimum ratios of all samples tested across the two-three independent replicates performed by the testing laboratories. Table 1 shows the % of values falling within ratios of 1, 2, or \u22654. Figure 1 plots the ratios per laboratory for each in\ufb02uenza subtype/lineage tested. Ratios were generally good for in\ufb02uenza A H1N1 and H3N2 strains, with more than 90% of ratios being <3.5. There is greater intra-laboratory variability for the B- strains, with some individual laboratories frequently obtaining ratios higher than 4. Samples with maximum to minimum ratios greater than 3.5 were excluded from further analysis (see statistical analysis). Overall, 11% of returned data was excluded, with the highest failure rate for B Yamagata (% excluded data H1N1: 9.5%, H3N2: 7.2%, B Victoria: 12.6% and B Yamagata: 15.1%). Frontiers in Immunology 04 10.3389/\ufb01mmu.2023.1129765 3.2.3 Inter-laboratory variability An inter-laboratory (or between-laboratory) variability analysis was carried out by comparison of %GCV for each sample tested across all laboratories and a comparison of the GMR of each sample. GMRs were calculated as the ratio of the titre of a sample in a given laboratory/run divided by the global GMT of that sample across all testing laboratories. This gives a relative measure of agreement between the laboratories, where in a perfect world all titres for a sample are the same and thus all ratios are 1. Where a laboratory returns a titre twice the value of the global GMT, the ratio is 2, and conversely where a laboratory returns a titre half that of the global GMT, the ratio is 0.5. The indicative interval of 0.8- 1.25 is considered to be acceptable, however this is an arbitrary range. Supplementary Figure S1A shows the overall returned HAI data (after data exclusion as described in statistical analysis) from all laboratories for each in\ufb02uenza A subtype and B lineage. Data from in-house testing is shown in black, data from FLUCOP testing is shown in red. Figure 2 plots the GMR of each sample by laboratory (Figure 2A) and shows a heatmap of %GCV for each sample (Figures 2B, C). Inter-laboratory variation was overall quite low for H1N1 and H3N2 testing, with overall %GCVs of 68 and 55 respectively. Both B Victoria and B Yamagata lineages show much higher inter- laboratory variation, with overall %GCVs of 148 and 176, respectively. 3.2.4 Impact of a study standard on HAI inter- laboratory variation We included two pools of human sera as study standards within the serum panel tested by participating laboratories. The impact of normalisation using these study standards was explored by comparison of %GCV of log 1 0 titres before and after normalisation with the study standard and a comparison of GMRs before and after normalisation. Pool 1 was selected as more laboratories returned a valid titre for Pool 1 than Pool 2. Supplementary Figure S1B shows the overall returned HAI data from all laboratories after normalization with Pool 1 (sample 17 in the serum panel). Figure 3A shows the GMR of each sample by laboratory before and after normalization, and Figures 3B, C shows the %GCV of each sample before and after normalization. GMRs after normalization are closer to 1, particularly for the B strains.

For normalization of titres, from the two serum standards (pools of post-vaccination serum as previously described) included in the panel, we selected the serum standard for which the greatest number of valid data were returned - sample no.17. For each run a calibration factor was calculated as the ratio of titre of sample no.17 in a run/the global GMT of sample no.17 (GMT across all testing runs/laboratories after data exclusion as described above).

One participant dropped out of the study due to administrative issues. For HAI analysis 13 laboratories returned data. One laboratory was excluded as only a single replicate was carried out. Six laboratories carried out both FLUCOP and in-house HAI testing, giving 19 data sets in total. One laboratory carried out two runs (of both FLUCOP and in-house testing). Where two-three independent replicates were carried out, data was taken forward for analysis. For MN testing 8 laboratories returned data. Four laboratories carried out in-house testing, two laboratories used the WHO ELISA-based MN assay (hereafter designated FLU in \ufb01gures) and two laboratories carried out both in-house and the WHO ELISA-based MN assays, giving 10 data sets in total. It should be noted that laboratory 4 returned MN data for the B lineage viruses only, and laboratory 5 returned in-house MN data for the H3N2 in\ufb02uenza A virus only. 3.2 HAI testing results 3.2.1 Intra-assay variability We conducted an intra-assay (or within run) variability analysis by comparing the maximum to minimum ratio of 4 pairs of coded duplicates within the serum panel. Duplicate ratios of equal to or less than 2 (\u22642) were considered acceptable. In the data returned over 98% of duplicate ratios were \u22642 (73% of the ratios were =1 i.e. the duplicate samples had the same value).

There is greater intra-laboratory variability for the B- strains, with some individual laboratories frequently obtaining ratios higher than 4. Samples with maximum to minimum ratios greater than 3.5 were excluded from further analysis (see statistical analysis). Overall, 11% of returned data was excluded, with the highest failure rate for B Yamagata (% excluded data H1N1: 9.5%, H3N2: 7.2%, B Victoria: 12.6% and B Yamagata: 15.1%).

GMRs were calculated as the ratio of the titre of a sample in a given laboratory/run divided by the global GMT of that sample across all testing laboratories. This gives a relative measure of agreement between the laboratories, where in a perfect world all titres for a sample are the same and thus all ratios are 1. Where a laboratory returns a titre twice the value of the global GMT, the ratio is 2, and conversely where a laboratory returns a titre half that of the global GMT, the ratio is 0.5. The indicative interval of 0.8- 1.25 is considered to be acceptable, however this is an arbitrary range.

Data from in-house testing is shown in black, data from FLUCOP testing is shown in red. Figure 2 plots the GMR of each sample by laboratory (Figure 2A) and shows a heatmap of %GCV for each sample (Figures 2B, C). Inter-laboratory variation was overall quite low for H1N1 and H3N2 testing, with overall %GCVs of 68 and 55 respectively. Both B Victoria and B Yamagata lineages show much higher inter- laboratory variation, with overall %GCVs of 148 and 176, respectively. 3.2.4 Impact of a study standard on HAI inter- laboratory variation We included two pools of human sera as study standards within the serum panel tested by participating laboratories.

Supplementary Figure S1B shows the overall returned HAI data from all laboratories after normalization with Pool 1 (sample 17 in the serum panel). Figure 3A shows the GMR of each sample by laboratory before and after normalization, and Figures 3B, C shows the %GCV of each sample before and after normalization. GMRs after normalization are closer to 1, particularly for the B strains. Normalization signi\ufb01cantly reduces %GCV for all subtypes tested: overall %GCVs are reduced from 68% to 50% (H1N1), from 55% to 51% (H3N2),"}], "doc_text": "or the GMT of a sample across all laboratories testing with in-house protocols). For normalization of titres, from the two serum standards (pools of post-vaccination serum as previously described) included in the panel, we selected the serum standard for which the greatest number of valid data were returned - sample no.17. For each run a calibration factor was calculated as the ratio of titre of sample no.17 in a run/the global GMT of sample no.17 (GMT across all testing runs/laboratories after data exclusion as described above). The calibration factor was then applied to all other titres within that run to calculate normalized titres. Each participant received a report giving an overview of all returned data, with laboratory speci\ufb01c information for the following: intra-assay variability (maximum-minimum duplicate sample ratios %>3.5 by subtype/lineage compared to the average across testing laboratories), intra-laboratory variability (maximum- frontiersin.org Waldock et al. minimum ratios of sample titres across runs %>3.5 by subtype/ lineage compared to the average across testing laboratories) and inter-laboratory variability (GMRs pre- and post- normalization by subtype/lineage compared to the average across testing laboratories). 3 Results 3.1 Returned data Of the 17 accepted participants 16 laboratories returned data by the study deadline. One participant dropped out of the study due to administrative issues. For HAI analysis 13 laboratories returned data. One laboratory was excluded as only a single replicate was carried out. Six laboratories carried out both FLUCOP and in-house HAI testing, giving 19 data sets in total. One laboratory carried out two runs (of both FLUCOP and in-house testing). Where two-three independent replicates were carried out, data was taken forward for analysis. For MN testing 8 laboratories returned data. Four laboratories carried out in-house testing, two laboratories used the WHO ELISA-based MN assay (hereafter designated FLU in \ufb01gures) and two laboratories carried out both in-house and the WHO ELISA-based MN assays, giving 10 data sets in total. It should be noted that laboratory 4 returned MN data for the B lineage viruses only, and laboratory 5 returned in-house MN data for the H3N2 in\ufb02uenza A virus only. 3.2 HAI testing results 3.2.1 Intra-assay variability We conducted an intra-assay (or within run) variability analysis by comparing the maximum to minimum ratio of 4 pairs of coded duplicates within the serum panel. Duplicate ratios of equal to or less than 2 (\u22642) were considered acceptable. In the data returned over 98% of duplicate ratios were \u22642 (73% of the ratios were =1 i.e. the duplicate samples had the same value). Intra-assay performance was good across all laboratories (with a small number of laboratories having higher incidence of duplicate ratios greater than 2) 3.2.2 Intra-laboratory variability We conducted an intra-laboratory (or between-run) variability analysis by comparing maximum to minimum ratios of all samples tested across the two-three independent replicates performed by the testing laboratories. Table 1 shows the % of values falling within ratios of 1, 2, or \u22654. Figure 1 plots the ratios per laboratory for each in\ufb02uenza subtype/lineage tested. Ratios were generally good for in\ufb02uenza A H1N1 and H3N2 strains, with more than 90% of ratios being <3.5. There is greater intra-laboratory variability for the B- strains, with some individual laboratories frequently obtaining ratios higher than 4. Samples with maximum to minimum ratios greater than 3.5 were excluded from further analysis (see statistical analysis). Overall, 11% of returned data was excluded, with the highest failure rate for B Yamagata (% excluded data H1N1: 9.5%, H3N2: 7.2%, B Victoria: 12.6% and B Yamagata: 15.1%). Frontiers in Immunology 04 10.3389/\ufb01mmu.2023.1129765 3.2.3 Inter-laboratory variability An inter-laboratory (or between-laboratory) variability analysis was carried out by comparison of %GCV for each sample tested across all laboratories and a comparison of the GMR of each sample. GMRs were calculated as the ratio of the titre of a sample in a given laboratory/run divided by the global GMT of that sample across all testing laboratories. This gives a relative measure of agreement between the laboratories, where in a perfect world all titres for a sample are the same and thus all ratios are 1. Where a laboratory returns a titre twice the value of the global GMT, the ratio is 2, and conversely where a laboratory returns a titre half that of the global GMT, the ratio is 0.5. The indicative interval of 0.8- 1.25 is considered to be acceptable, however this is an arbitrary range. Supplementary Figure S1A shows the overall returned HAI data (after data exclusion as described in statistical analysis) from all laboratories for each in\ufb02uenza A subtype and B lineage. Data from in-house testing is shown in black, data from FLUCOP testing is shown in red. Figure 2 plots the GMR of each sample by laboratory (Figure 2A) and shows a heatmap of %GCV for each sample (Figures 2B, C). Inter-laboratory variation was overall quite low for H1N1 and H3N2 testing, with overall %GCVs of 68 and 55 respectively. Both B Victoria and B Yamagata lineages show much higher inter- laboratory variation, with overall %GCVs of 148 and 176, respectively. 3.2.4 Impact of a study standard on HAI inter- laboratory variation We included two pools of human sera as study standards within the serum panel tested by participating laboratories. The impact of normalisation using these study standards was explored by comparison of %GCV of log 1 0 titres before and after normalisation with the study standard and a comparison of GMRs before and after normalisation. Pool 1 was selected as more laboratories returned a valid titre for Pool 1 than Pool 2. Supplementary Figure S1B shows the overall returned HAI data from all laboratories after normalization with Pool 1 (sample 17 in the serum panel). Figure 3A shows the GMR of each sample by laboratory before and after normalization, and Figures 3B, C shows the %GCV of each sample before and after normalization. GMRs after normalization are closer to 1, particularly for the B strains. Normalization signi\ufb01cantly reduces %GCV for all subtypes tested: overall %GCVs are reduced from 68% to 50% (H1N1), from 55% to 51% (H3N2),"}
