(Shanghai, China). RNA sequencing data for AITL (n = 51) (GSE19069 and GSE58445) were downloaded from the GEO website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/). The details of RNA sequencing are provided in the Supplementary Materials. 2.5 Analysis of exhaustion-related biological changes in CD8+TILs by RNA sequencing The average expression levels of CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1 detected by RNA sequencing were de\ufb01ned as the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) levels (8); the 20 AITL cases were divided into high- and low-CTL groups based on the mean CTL marker levels. The 189-exhaustion biology-related gene panel was established according to a previous study, which showed a positive association with CD8+TILs exhaustion and re\ufb02ected exhaustion from 19 biological aspects (9, 10) (including IC, glycosylation, effector functions, IFN response, translation, cytokines, ubiquitination, mitochondria, chromatin/DNA repair, proteases, homing and migration, cytoskeleton/cell adhesion, metabolism, cell surface receptors and ligands, apoptosis/cell death/caspase and annexins, membrane biology and vesicle transport, cell cycle, signaling, and miscellaneous aspects) (Supplementary Table 1). The 189-exhaustion biology-related gene panel was then used to analyze exhaustion-related biological changes in CD8+TILs from the high- and low-CTL groups. 2.6 Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version 26.0, SPSS Corp., Chicago, IL, USA). Spearman\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cients were used to assess correlations among CD8+TILs, CD8A, CD8B, and IC. The chi-square test was used to compare the proportion of increased IC between the high- and low-CD8+TILs groups, as well as the CTL groups, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the high- and low-CTL groups. The cutoff values for CD8+TILs and CTL were de\ufb01ned as the points at which sensitivity and speci\ufb01city were maximized in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for predicting overall survival (OS). Survival time was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. A two-tailed p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signi\ufb01cant. 3 Results 3.1 Patient characteristics Based on the inclusion criteria, 40 patients with de novo AITL were included in our cohort. The median patient age was 60 years (range, 38\u201383 years). Men accounted for 65% (n = 26) and women accounted for 35% (n = 14) of the sample. Eighteen (64.3%) patients were at an advanced stage (III/IV), and 28 (75.7%) were in a generally good Frontiers in Immunology 03 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1228004 condition (PS 0-1). The basic information is summarized in Table 2. Most patients (n = 24, 64.9%) received chemotherapy with the CHOP, R-CHOP, or ICE regimens, whereas a few patients (n = 5, 13.5%) received other treatment options, including surgery and immune- related therapies. Overall, 19 (73.1%) patients responded positively to the treatment. Eight patients (21.6%) refused treatment after diagnosis because of advanced disease stage, compromised general condition, and chemotherapy intolerance. Treatment-related data for three patients were not available. 3.2 Analysis of IC in CD8+TILs using scRNA-seq After quality control and \ufb01ltering, we obtained single-cell transcriptomes for 14 406 cells from the lymph node tissues of two patients with AITL (AITL-1, CD8+TILs:60.9%; AITL-2, CD8+TILs:48.6%). Through principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding analysis (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), three main clusters were identi\ufb01ed, including T-TILs (CD3D, CD3E, CD3G), B-TILs (CD19, MS4A1, CD79B), and macrophages (CD68, CD14), among which the T-TILs comprised naive T-TILs (IL7R, TCF7), CD4+TILs (CD4), and CD8+TILs (CD8A, CD8B) (Figure 1; Supplementary Figures 1, 2). AITL-1 showed higher expression of CTL and multiple IC genes in CD8+TILs than those in AITL-2 (Figure 2A); CD8+TILs from AITL-1 and AITL-2 were further divided into two clusters, including CD8-1 and CD8-2 cells (Supplementary Figure 3). Compared to that in CD8-1 cells, the expression of CTL and multiple IC genes was higher in CD8-2 cells (Figure 2B). 3.3 Analysis of IC in CD8+TILs using FCM The mean proportions of CD8+TILs, CD8+PD-1+, CD8+CTLA- 4+, CD8+TIM3+, CD8+LAG3+, and CD8+TIGIT+ in AITL (n = 20) (Figures 3A\u2013E) were 40.75% (range, 4.1\u201378.9%), 14.39% (range, 0.19\u2013 45.53%), 9.09% (range, 0.11\u201344.28%), 2.63% (range, 0\u201310.66%), 3.36% (range, 0.22\u201314.93%), and 13.57% (range, 0.24\u201347.88%), respectively (Table 3). The proportion of CD8+TILs in AITL was positively correlated with that of CD8+TIM3+ (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), CD8+LAG3+ (r = 0.70, p < 0.001), CD8+CTLA-4+ (r = 0.57, p = 0.008), CD8+TIGIT+ (r = 0.55, p = 0.012), and CD8+PD-1+ (r = 0.54, p = 0.03) (Figure 4). Twenty patients were divided into high- and low- expression groups according to the mean proportions of CD8+TILs and IC, respectively. Compared to the low CD8+TILs group, the number of cases with IC \u2265 3 increased in the high CD8+TILs group (20% vs. 90%, p = 0.003) (Supplementary Table 2). 3.4 Analysis of IC in CD8+TILs using RNA sequencing The mean expression levels of the CTL and IC genes are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

Eighteen (64.3%) patients were at an advanced stage (III/IV), and 28 (75.7%) were in a generally good Frontiers in Immunology 03 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1228004 condition (PS 0-1). The basic information is summarized in Table 2. Most patients (n = 24, 64.9%) received chemotherapy with the CHOP, R-CHOP, or ICE regimens, whereas a few patients (n = 5, 13.5%) received other treatment options, including surgery and immune- related therapies. Overall, 19 (73.1%) patients responded positively to the treatment. Eight patients (21.6%) refused treatment after diagnosis because of advanced disease stage, compromised general condition, and chemotherapy intolerance. Treatment-related data for three patients were not available. 3.2 Analysis of IC in CD8+TILs using scRNA-seq After quality control and \ufb01ltering, we obtained single-cell transcriptomes for 14 406 cells from the lymph node tissues of two patients with AITL (AITL-1, CD8+TILs:60.9%; AITL-2, CD8+TILs:48.6%). Through principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding analysis (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), three main clusters were identi\ufb01ed, including T-TILs (CD3D, CD3E, CD3G), B-TILs (CD19, MS4A1, CD79B), and macrophages (CD68, CD14), among which the T-TILs comprised naive T-TILs (IL7R, TCF7), CD4+TILs (CD4), and CD8+TILs (CD8A, CD8B) (Figure 1; Supplementary Figures 1, 2). AITL-1 showed higher expression of CTL and multiple IC genes in CD8+TILs than those in AITL-2 (Figure 2A); CD8+TILs from AITL-1 and AITL-2 were further divided into two clusters, including CD8-1 and CD8-2 cells (Supplementary Figure 3). Compared to that in CD8-1 cells, the expression of CTL and multiple IC genes was higher in CD8-2 cells (Figure 2B). 3.3 Analysis of IC in CD8+TILs using FCM The mean proportions of CD8+TILs, CD8+PD-1+, CD8+CTLA- 4+, CD8+TIM3+, CD8+LAG3+, and CD8+TIGIT+ in AITL (n = 20) (Figures 3A\u2013E) were 40.75% (range, 4.1\u201378.9%), 14.39% (range, 0.19\u2013 45.53%), 9.09% (range, 0.11\u201344.28%), 2.63% (range, 0\u201310.66%), 3.36% (range, 0.22\u201314.93%), and 13.57% (range, 0.24\u201347.88%), respectively (Table 3). The proportion of CD8+TILs in AITL was positively correlated with that of CD8+TIM3+ (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), CD8+LAG3+ (r = 0.70, p < 0.001), CD8+CTLA-4+ (r = 0.57, p = 0.008), CD8+TIGIT+ (r = 0.55, p = 0.012), and CD8+PD-1+ (r = 0.54, p = 0.03) (Figure 4). Twenty patients were divided into high- and low- expression groups according to the mean proportions of CD8+TILs and IC, respectively. Compared to the low CD8+TILs group, the number of cases with IC \u2265 3 increased in the high CD8+TILs group (20% vs. 90%, p = 0.003) (Supplementary Table 2). 3.4 Analysis of IC in CD8+TILs using RNA sequencing The mean expression levels of the CTL and IC genes are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

The details of RNA sequencing are provided in the Supplementary Materials. 2.5 Analysis of exhaustion-related biological changes in CD8+TILs by RNA sequencing The average expression levels of CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1 detected by RNA sequencing were de\ufb01ned as the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) levels (8); the 20 AITL cases were divided into high- and low-CTL groups based on the mean CTL marker levels. The 189-exhaustion biology-related gene panel was established according to a previous study, which showed a positive association with CD8+TILs exhaustion and re\ufb02ected exhaustion from 19 biological aspects (9, 10) (including IC, glycosylation, effector functions, IFN response, translation, cytokines, ubiquitination, mitochondria, chromatin/DNA repair, proteases, homing and migration, cytoskeleton/cell adhesion, metabolism, cell surface receptors and ligands, apoptosis/cell death/caspase and annexins, membrane biology and vesicle transport, cell cycle, signaling, and miscellaneous aspects) (Supplementary Table 1). The 189-exhaustion biology-related gene panel was then used to analyze exhaustion-related biological changes in CD8+TILs from the high- and low-CTL groups. 2.6 Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version 26.0, SPSS Corp., Chicago, IL, USA). Spearman\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cients were used to assess correlations among CD8+TILs, CD8A, CD8B, and IC. The chi-square test was used to compare the proportion of increased IC between the high- and low-CD8+TILs groups, as well as the CTL groups, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the high- and low-CTL groups. The cutoff values for CD8+TILs and CTL were de\ufb01ned as the points at which sensitivity and speci\ufb01city were maximized in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for predicting overall survival (OS).

The details of RNA sequencing are provided in the Supplementary Materials. 2.5 Analysis of exhaustion-related biological changes in CD8+TILs by RNA sequencing The average expression levels of CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1 detected by RNA sequencing were de\ufb01ned as the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) levels (8); the 20 AITL cases were divided into high- and low-CTL groups based on the mean CTL marker levels. The 189-exhaustion biology-related gene panel was established according to a previous study, which showed a positive association with CD8+TILs exhaustion and re\ufb02ected exhaustion from 19 biological aspects (9, 10) (including IC, glycosylation, effector functions, IFN response, translation, cytokines, ubiquitination, mitochondria, chromatin/DNA repair, proteases, homing and migration, cytoskeleton/cell adhesion, metabolism, cell surface receptors and ligands, apoptosis/cell death/caspase and annexins, membrane biology and vesicle transport, cell cycle, signaling, and miscellaneous aspects) (Supplementary Table 1). The 189-exhaustion biology-related gene panel was then used to analyze exhaustion-related biological changes in CD8+TILs from the high- and low-CTL groups. 2.6 Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version 26.0, SPSS Corp., Chicago, IL, USA). Spearman\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cients were used to assess correlations among CD8+TILs, CD8A, CD8B, and IC. The chi-square test was used to compare the proportion of increased IC between the high- and low-CD8+TILs groups, as well as the CTL groups, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the high- and low-CTL groups. The cutoff values for CD8+TILs and CTL were de\ufb01ned as the points at which sensitivity and speci\ufb01city were maximized in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for predicting overall survival (OS). Survival time was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. A two-tailed p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signi\ufb01cant. 3 Results 3.1 Patient characteristics Based on the inclusion criteria, 40 patients with de novo AITL were included in our cohort. The median patient age was 60 years (range, 38\u201383 years). Men accounted for 65% (n = 26) and women accounted for 35% (n = 14) of the sample. Eighteen (64.3%) patients were at an advanced stage (III/IV), and 28 (75.7%) were in a generally good Frontiers in Immunology 03 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1228004 condition (PS 0-1). The basic information is summarized in Table 2. Most patients (n = 24, 64.9%) received chemotherapy with the CHOP, R-CHOP, or ICE regimens, whereas a few patients (n = 5, 13.5%) received other treatment options, including surgery and immune- related therapies. Overall, 19 (73.1%) patients responded positively to the treatment. Eight patients (21.6%) refused treatment after diagnosis because of advanced disease stage, compromised general condition, and chemotherapy intolerance. Treatment-related data for three patients were not available. 3.2 Analysis of IC in CD8+TILs using scRNA-seq After quality control and \ufb01ltering, we obtained single-cell transcriptomes for 14 406 cells from the lymph node tissues of two patients with AITL (AITL-1, CD8+TILs:60.9%; AITL-2, CD8+TILs:48.6%). Through principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding analysis (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), three main clusters were identi\ufb01ed, including T-TILs (CD3D, CD3E, CD3G), B-TILs (CD19, MS4A1, CD79B), and macrophages (CD68, CD14), among which the T-TILs comprised naive T-TILs (IL7R, TCF7), CD4+TILs (CD4), and CD8+TILs (CD8A, CD8B) (Figure 1; Supplementary Figures 1, 2). AITL-1 showed higher expression of CTL and multiple IC genes in CD8+TILs than those in AITL-2 (Figure 2A); CD8+TILs from AITL-1 and AITL-2 were further divided into two clusters, including CD8-1 and CD8-2 cells (Supplementary Figure 3). Compared to that in CD8-1 cells, the expression of CTL and multiple IC genes was higher in CD8-2 cells (Figure 2B). 3.3 Analysis of IC in CD8+TILs using FCM The mean proportions of CD8+TILs, CD8+PD-1+, CD8+CTLA- 4+, CD8+TIM3+, CD8+LAG3+, and CD8+TIGIT+ in AITL (n = 20) (Figures 3A\u2013E) were 40.75% (range, 4.1\u201378.9%), 14.39% (range, 0.19\u2013 45.53%), 9.09% (range, 0.11\u201344.28%), 2.63% (range, 0\u201310.66%), 3.36% (range, 0.22\u201314.93%), and 13.57% (range, 0.24\u201347.88%), respectively (Table 3). The proportion of CD8+TILs in AITL was positively correlated with that of CD8+TIM3+ (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), CD8+LAG3+ (r = 0.70, p < 0.001), CD8+CTLA-4+ (r = 0.57, p = 0.008), CD8+TIGIT+ (r = 0.55, p = 0.012), and CD8+PD-1+ (r = 0.54, p = 0.03) (Figure 4). Twenty patients were divided into high- and low- expression groups according to the mean proportions of CD8+TILs and IC, respectively. Compared to the low CD8+TILs group, the number of cases with IC \u2265 3 increased in the high CD8+TILs group (20% vs. 90%, p = 0.003) (Supplementary Table 2). 3.4 Analysis of IC in CD8+TILs using RNA sequencing The mean expression levels of the CTL and IC genes are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

Overall, 19 (73.1%) patients responded positively to the treatment. Eight patients (21.6%) refused treatment after diagnosis because of advanced disease stage, compromised general condition, and chemotherapy intolerance. Treatment-related data for three patients were not available. 3.2 Analysis of IC in CD8+TILs using scRNA-seq After quality control and \ufb01ltering, we obtained single-cell transcriptomes for 14 406 cells from the lymph node tissues of two patients with AITL (AITL-1, CD8+TILs:60.9%; AITL-2, CD8+TILs:48.6%). Through principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding analysis (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), three main clusters were identi\ufb01ed, including T-TILs (CD3D, CD3E, CD3G), B-TILs (CD19, MS4A1, CD79B), and macrophages (CD68, CD14), among which the T-TILs comprised naive T-TILs (IL7R, TCF7), CD4+TILs (CD4), and CD8+TILs (CD8A, CD8B) (Figure 1; Supplementary Figures 1, 2). AITL-1 showed higher expression of CTL and multiple IC genes in CD8+TILs than those in AITL-2 (Figure 2A); CD8+TILs from AITL-1 and AITL-2 were further divided into two clusters, including CD8-1 and CD8-2 cells (Supplementary Figure 3). Compared to that in CD8-1 cells, the expression of CTL and multiple IC genes was higher in CD8-2 cells (Figure 2B). 3.3 Analysis of IC in CD8+TILs using FCM The mean proportions of CD8+TILs, CD8+PD-1+, CD8+CTLA- 4+, CD8+TIM3+, CD8+LAG3+, and CD8+TIGIT+ in AITL (n = 20) (Figures 3A\u2013E) were 40.75% (range, 4.1\u201378.9%), 14.39% (range, 0.19\u2013 45.53%), 9.09% (range, 0.11\u201344.28%), 2.63% (range, 0\u201310.66%), 3.36% (range, 0.22\u201314.93%), and 13.57% (range, 0.24\u201347.88%), respectively (Table 3). The proportion of CD8+TILs in AITL was positively correlated with that of CD8+TIM3+ (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), CD8+LAG3+ (r = 0.70, p < 0.001), CD8+CTLA-4+ (r = 0.57, p = 0.008), CD8+TIGIT+ (r = 0.55, p = 0.012), and CD8+PD-1+ (r = 0.54, p = 0.03) (Figure 4). Twenty patients were divided into high- and low- expression groups according to the mean proportions of CD8+TILs and IC, respectively. Compared to the low CD8+TILs group, the number of cases with IC \u2265 3 increased in the high CD8+TILs group (20% vs. 90%, p = 0.003) (Supplementary Table 2). 3.4 Analysis of IC in CD8+TILs using RNA sequencing The mean expression levels of the CTL and IC genes are shown in Supplementary Table 3. The CTL showed strong positive frontiersin.org Zhu et al. TABLE 2 The baseline of patients with AITL in FCM and RNA sequencing. Characteristic NO in group (%) Age, median (range) 60(38-83) Gender"}
