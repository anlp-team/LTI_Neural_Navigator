The Schisandra National Forest Germplasm Bank of the Institute of Special Products of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has collected white and yellow Schisandra germplasm resources and used SRAP technology to analyze the genetic rules of fruit color.

In this study, we measured the volatile components of dried fruits and branch exudates of three different fruit colors of Schisandra and established a \ufb01ngerprint map of volatile components of different fruit colors of Schisandra. Using principal component analysis, cluster analysis, OAV value analysis, OPLS-DA analysis and other methods, we screened the key aroma components of Schisandra and qualitatively analyzed the key volatile components of different fruit colors of Schisandra fruits.

As a result, the color of Schisandra berries has been subjected to directional selection pressure during natural evolution. White and yellow germplasms, as freely segregating offspring, are very precious germplasm resources. The Schisandra National Forest Germplasm Bank of the Institute of Special Products of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has collected white and yellow Schisandra germplasm resources and used SRAP technology to analyze the genetic rules of fruit color. The results show that the genotype of red Schisandra is dominant homozygous, white is recessive homozygous, and yellow fruit is heterozygous [16]. However, there have been no reports on the differences in volatile components between different fruit colors. In this study, we measured the volatile components of dried fruits and branch exudates of three different fruit colors of Schisandra and established a \ufb01ngerprint map of volatile components of different fruit colors of Schisandra. Using principal component analysis, cluster analysis, OAV value analysis, OPLS-DA analysis and other methods, we screened the key aroma components of Schisandra and qualitatively analyzed the key volatile components of different fruit colors of Schisandra fruits. This lays a foundation for germplasm identi\ufb01cation, quality evaluation, variety selection, and development of volatile compounds in dried fruits and branch exudates. 2.

Ion Migration Spectra Analysis of White, Yellow, and Red Schisandra chinensis Dried Fruits The ion migration spectra of dried fruits of di\ufb00erent colors are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that there are more points separated in the dried fruit spectra than in the branch sap spectra. By judging the peak positions, it can be preliminarily seen that the components of W4 and W5 are more similar and signi\ufb01cantly di\ufb00erent from those of W6. The di\ufb00erential spectrum shows that there are more blue dots in W6, indicating that the relative content of some volatile chemical substances in W4 and W5 is higher than that in W6.

Analysis of Ion Migration Spectra of Schisandra chinensis Branch Sap and Dried Fruits of Di\ufb00erent Colors Using GC-IMS technology to analyze the volatile components of branch sap and dried fruits of three di\ufb00erent colors, the two-dimensional ion migration spectra of volatile organic compounds obtained are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The horizontal axis represents the ion migration time, and the vertical axis represents the gas chromatographic retention time. The red vertical line at 1.0 on the horizontal axis is the RIP (reaction ion peak), and the dots shown in the picture are the volatile organic compounds detected in the sample. From white to red, the deeper the color, the higher the relative concentration of volatile organic compounds. 2.1.1. Ion Migration Spectra Analysis of White, Yellow, and Red Fruit Branch Sap Figure 1 shows that the peak positions of W1 and W2 in the three ion migration spectra are close, and the composition of W3 is signi\ufb01cantly di\ufb00erent from that of W1 and W2. Taking W1 as a reference and subtracting the signal peaks of W1 in the remaining spectra, a di\ufb00erential spectrum can be obtained. In the di\ufb00erential spectrum, blue dots indicate that the corresponding volatile organic compounds in this sample are reduced compared to those at the same position in W1. Red dots indicate that this substance contains more than W1, and the deeper the color, the greater the di\ufb00erence. In the di\ufb00erential spectrum, it can be found that compared with W1, except for some positions where the content of W2 is reduced, there are fewer volatile organic compound di\ufb00erence points. The content di\ufb00erence of volatile organic compounds in W3 is more signi\ufb01cant, and there are more di\ufb00erence substances compared with W1 and W2. Molecules 2023, 28, 6865 3 of 16 compounds obtained are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
