The wind field is an important meteorological factor affecting the accumulation or dispersion of atmospheric pollutants [66]. Figures 6 and 7 show the horizontal wind field profiles and vertical wind field plots, respectively, during this period of haze pollution. Positive values in the vertical wind field plots indicate a sinking airflow and negative values indicate a rising airflow. During PE1, Beijing was in the southeast of the low-pressure system from 12:00 to 18:00 and the near-surface winds were mainly southerly. Pollutants were continuously transported from southern Beijing to downtown Beijing, which accelerated the accumulation of pollutants [50]. With the eastward movement of the low-pressure system, the near-surface wind speed weakened and the lifting airflow gradually strengthened.

In general, aerosols, sea salt particles and the water droplets in clouds are almost spherical, with a relatively low depolarization, so they are not easily distinguished from atmospheric pollutants. By contrast, dust aerosols and ice crystals in ice clouds are non-spherical with a relatively large depolarization (>0.2), so they are easily distinguished from atmospheric pollutants [74].

The aerosol concentration increased significantly and the depolarization ratio was <0.2 during the accumulation of pollutants, indicating that this process consisted mainly of the accumulation of spherical particles. In PE2, with the accumulation of pollutants, the height of the area with a high aerosol extinction coefficient gradually increased to about 1.0 km and the receding polarization ratio of this layer was relatively large (>0.2) from 12:00 to 18:00 on 10 February. There was an updraft of 1\u20131.5 m s\u22121 below 500 m at about 12:00 on 10 February (Figure 7). This indicates that a dust-raising process that produced non-spherical particles occurred from 12:00 to 18:00. The receding polarization ratios were relatively low (<0.1) at all other times, indicating that a large number of water-soluble spherical particles were produced during this haze episode [21].
