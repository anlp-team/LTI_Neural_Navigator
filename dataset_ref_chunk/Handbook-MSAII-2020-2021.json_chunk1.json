The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.\n3 Degree Requirements\n3.1 Course Grade and GPA Requirements\nTo receive the M.S. degree, all students must take and successfully complete at least 195 units of coursework. All required Core Courses must be completed with a grade of B or better. For the Knowledge Area Courses, students must maintain a B average. No grade lower than C shall be used for credit applied toward graduation. No undergraduate courses count toward the 192- unit requirement.\nAll Core courses are organized in sequence, and must be taken in the following order:\nArtificial Intelligence and Future Markets (11-651) \u2013 No prerequisite required. \u2022 AI Engineering (11-695) \u2013 Prerequisite is the completion of 11-651 with a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better.\nLTI Practicum (11-935) \u2013 Three credit units for completing the required Internship. \u2022 AI Innovation (11-654) \u2013 Prerequisite is the completion of 11-695 with a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better.\nCapstone (11-699) \u2013 Prerequisite is the completion of 11-654 with a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better.\nStudents are required to repeat any required course that they have completed with a grade less than the required minimum, preferably at the next offering. (Please note that Core courses and Knowledge courses are only offered once per year.) Students will be allowed to retake a required course only once. If a student fails in the second attempt, he or she will be dropped from the MSAII program.\nIf a student fails an elective course, she or he will need to repeat the same or take a substitute course (equivalent course approved by the Director).\n10\n\n\nAll grades count towards the program QPA, except for repeated courses, in which case the final grade replaces the previous grade. Courses taken pass/no pass do not affect the student\u2019s QPA. However, ONLY ELECTIVE COURSES MAY BE TAKEN PASS/NO PASS, unless the Provost directs to the contrary. Students who do not achieve the required minimum grade in a required course, who elect to take an \u201cincomplete\u201d in a required course, or whose cumulative grade point average is below a B (3.0), will be placed on academic probation. Students on probation are not eligible to graduate. Students who are placed on academic probation shall receive written a notice of this finding, including a list of measures that need to be taken to be removed from academic probation. A student on academic probation for two consecutive semesters may be dropped from the program.\nThe MSAII program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each semester in order to monitor individual student progress toward graduation. Should a student\u2019s effort fall below the acceptable academic performance and/or fail to meet the standards established by the MSAII program and Carnegie Mellon University, the student may be dismissed from the program.\nShould a student\u2019s overall QPA drop below 3.0 during any given semester, he/she will be placed on departmental probation for the following semester and will be required to improve his/her grades to no less than overall 3.0 QPA during that period. Failure to improve to an overall 3.0 QPA or better the following semester may result in termination from the program. In addition, a student who violates policies established by Carnegie Mellon University may be dismissed from the program.\nAfter each academic progress review, a student may receive one or more letters, indicating the result of the review. Warning letters are issued for the following cases:\n1) Overall QPA below 3.0 (Academic probation) 2) Semester QPA is below 3.0 3) Grade below B in a Core course 4) Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) according to the university policies. This includes any AIV letter received in 15-513 during the summer preceding matriculation.\nA student may be terminated from the program under any of the following circumstances:\na) A student who has received two Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letters will be terminated. There are no exceptions and the Program Director has no discretion over such a termination as it is an LTI policy.\nb) A student who has received one Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letter may be terminated by the Program Director if the violation is so serious that the student cannot be allowed to remain in the MSAII Program.\nc) A student has received three warning letters of any type from the MSAII program.\n11\n\n\nd) A student has been found to have violated a University Policy for which termination is\nprovided.\nAn AIV letter or violation of University Policy may be appealed pursuant to CMU appeal procedures. See Section 4.5.2, below. However, a decision to terminate a student after appeal because of conditions a), b), c) or d) is not appealable.\n3.2 Course Requirements\n1) Summer Before Entrance\nAdmitted students are required to take, pay for, and pass the 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems course during the summer prior to their arrival at Carnegie Mellon, but the summer class is only 6 units and will not be counted toward graduation units. 15-513 may be taken pass/fail, but it cannot be dropped. A student who drops 15-513 during the summer will not be permitted to begin the degree program in the fall, but must retake 15-513 the following summer. The MSAII course offerings are available at msaii.cs.cmu.edu/curriculum. The university\u2019s complete Schedule of Classes can be found at https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/search.\nStudents are then required to take and successfully complete the courses below:\n2) The Core Courses (87 units) - Must be taken in sequence:\n11-651 \u2013 AI & Future Markets \u2013 (12 units). First Fall semester\n17-762 \u2013 Law of Computer Technology (12 units). First Fall semester\n11-695 \u2013 AI Engineering (12 units). First Spring semester\n11-935 \u2013 LTI Practicum (3 units). Summer Internship\n11-654 \u2013 AI Innovation (12 units). Second Fall semester\n11-699 \u2013 Capstone Project (36 units). Second Spring semester\n3) The Knowledge Area Courses (72 units):\n11-601, Coding Bootcamp (12 units). First fall semester.\n10-601, Machine Learning (12 units), First fall semester. (Normally 11-691, Math for Machine Learning, which is not being offered in Fall 2020.)\n10-605, Machine Learning with Large Datasets (12 units). First spring semester.\n12\n\n\n11-611, Natural Language Processing (12 units). Second fall semester.\n11-785, Deep Learning (12 units). Second spring semester.\nOne more 12-unit AI course of the student\u2019s choice (with approval of the Program Director)\nIn the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a similar degree of difficulty may be substituted with the permission of the Director. If a student has already taken an equivalent course and shows proficiency in the subject area, a more advanced course in the area may be taken in place of these required courses with permission of the Director. Graduate students cannot receive credit for undergraduate courses.\n4) Electives:\nA minimum of 36 units of SCS courses must be taken. It is recommended to take one elective in the first fall semester, one or two in the first spring semester, one or two in the second fall semester and zero or one in the second spring semester. The courses below are approved. A student who wants to take a course not listed must obtain approval of the Director prior to registering. In general, the Director will approve any graduate SCS course of not more than 12 units. It is also possible to seek approval for courses in other Colleges at CMU. However, those courses must be rationally related to an AI career in order to be approved.\n11-641 Machine Learning for Text Mining 11-642 Search Engines 11-676 Big Data Analytics 11-747 Neural Networks for NLP 11-755 Machine Learning for Signal Processing 11-777 Advanced Multimodal Machine Learning 11-791 Design of Intelligent Information Systems 10-605 Machine Learning with Large Datasets 10-608 Conversational Machine Learning 10-702 Statistical Machine Learning 15-624 Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems 15-645 Database Systems 15-681 AI: Representation and Problem Solving 15-688 Practical Data Science 16-720 Computer Vision 16-725 Medical Image Analysis 16-772 Sensing and Sensors 16-824 Visual Learning and Recognition 17-637 Web Application Development 17-639 Management of Software Development\n13\n\n\n17-652 Methods: Deciding What to Design 17-653 Managing Software Development 17-766 Software Engineering for Startups 02-604 Fundamentals of Bioinformatics 02-718 Computational Medicine\nCourses carrying more than 12 units in a semester are NOT APPROVED as electives. The university\u2019s complete Schedule of Classes can be found at https://enr- apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/search.\nStudents may take athletics or music or theatrical performance courses that do not require work outside of class times. However, such courses will NOT count toward the 195 units required for graduation.\n3.3 Advising\n3.3.1 Student Advising\nEvery MSAII student will be assigned an advisor, normally the Program Director. Before the course registration period each semester, students must meet with their advisor to discuss their course selection. New students will be given instructions to register for their classes during the MSAII orientation.\n3.3.2 Monitoring Progress\nThe advisor meets with the student at least twice a year, providing guidance and monitoring the student\u2019s overall progress.\n3.3.3 Degree Certification\nStudents who graduate having met all the requires for the degree will receive a diploma stating that they have received as \u201cMaster of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation.\u201d\n3.4 Internship\nStudents must obtain an internship during the summer between the first and second years of the program. This is a requirement. An internship will provide students with the opportunity to apply the knowledge and technical skills learned during the first year of the program, to gain insight into AI and future market needs to further their experience and develop a strong context for the second-year concentration coursework. Normally the internship will be with an outside company. In some circumstances, a student who is doing research with a CMU faculty member during the summer may request that such research qualify as an internship.\n14\n\n\nStudents are encouraged to intern with an organization that corresponds to their individual area of interest and career goals.\nAll students who secure summer internships must register for three units in 11-935 (LTI Practicum). This course can be taken once during the program with Pass/Fail and will be counted toward graduation units. International students must apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) for the internship by contacting the Office of International Education (OIE). To obtain CPT, students need an offer letter spelling out employment dates, work hours, and wages or stipend. It is the student\u2019s responsibility under 11-935 to give a presentation during the semester following the internship to all current MSAI students detailing the student\u2019s internship experience.\nInternational students who are interested in working in the U.S after graduation should apply for the Optional Practical Training (OPT). The office of International Education (OIE) oversees the OPT registration. Note: OPT must only be used after students have completed their degree at Carnegie Mellon.\nNOTE: Students are personally responsible for securing a suitable internship. The Career and Professional Development Center will assist in their search for counseling, workshops, and internship opportunity listings in CareerNavigator. We strongly suggest students begin the internship search beginning in the Fall of your first year. Some internship opportunities have application deadlines in the Fall, so by starting your search early, you won't miss out on these internships. The Career and Professional Development Center will assist students with the internship search, but does not match students with employers; obtaining an internship is students\u2019 responsibility.\nThe following steps are recommended to ensure a successful internship outcome. Many of the events below will be conducted remotely during COVID.\nSeptember/October\nMeet with your advisor to discuss your interests and plan your internship search. \u2022 Review the internships of previous students. We also encourage you to speak informally with second-year students who can offer first-hand information about their internships. \u2022 Attend the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) at Carnegie Mellon for exposure to potential employers for internships.\nNovember/December\nBegin researching organizations and internship opportunities. Pay close attention to organizations that have established internship programs and their deadlines.\nAttend workshops to perfect your resume, hone your interviewing skills, and gain knowledge about the internship search process.\nJanuary/February\n15\n\n\nAt this point, you should have a \u201cshort list\u201d of organizations at which you would like to intern. This list can include organizations that have established internship programs as well as those that interest you without formal internship programs. \u2022 Update your resume with relevant academic projects, coursework, etc. \u2022 Begin utilizing your network for internship leads as well as checking organization\u2019s websites for internships.\nMake contact with employers, sending resumes and applications, and initiating internship interviews in person or by phone.\nAttend Network Nights and talk to alumni about internship opportunities in their organization. They are an excellent resource for learning more about a particular organization, career field or employment opportunity. You can find alumni in the Alumni Directory, Alumni Career Advisor Network, and Carnegie Mellon Alumni LinkedIn Network.\nMarch/April\nAt this point, you should have secured an internship or be interviewing with various organizations.\nPrepare a backup plan if your first choices of internships do not work out. \u2022 Attend relevant Network Nights and Career Fairs at Carnegie Mellon. \u2022 \u2022 MSAII students should enroll in 11-935 for three units. You will not have to pay tuition for this course.\n3.5 Employment Eligibility Verification\nIf you are receiving compensation from CMU, if you are going to be a TA or you are planning to seek a position with CMU, then Employment Eligibility Verification is required.\nForm I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below.\nTo ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf] covering the university\u2019s I-9 and E-Verify requirements:\nEvery individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment.\nIndividuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources.\n16\n\n\nFor more information, please see CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU [pdf], or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9.\n3.6 MSAII Orientation\nEach Fall semester, the MSAII program provides a program orientation to help new students learn about the program. All new students are required to attend them and treat them seriously because they explain the program sequence, its Core and Knowledge courses requirements and how students will meet the program learning outcomes.\n3.7 End of Semester Evaluation\nThe MSAII program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each semester in order to monitor individual student progress towards graduation. Should a student\u2019s effort fall below the acceptable level of academic performance and/or fail to meet the standards established by the MSAII program, the student may be dismissed from the program.\nAfter each academic progress review, a student may receive one or more letters, indicating the result of the review. See Section 3.1, Course Grade and GPA Requirements, above.\nAt the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \"black mark\" on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.\nIn the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student a letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.\n3.8 Enrollment Verification\nEnrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript, and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/transcripts/.\n17\n\n\n3.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading\n3.9.1 University Policy on Grades\nwww.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html\nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.\n3.9.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses & PCHE\nwww.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses are taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken but without a grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this.)\n3.10 Academic Integrity\nCarnegie Mellon\u2019s Academic Integrity policy is posted at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. All students are expected to be familiar with this policy, including the university-wide protocol for handling academic integrity violations. The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.\nA review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html) is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.\nIt is an absolute requirement that the work you submit must be your own, unless you specifically identify the source of any material that is not yours. This includes quotations and material from websites. In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any\n18\n\n\nperson other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that work. Any student who violates the academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in suspension or expulsion under University policies. THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE FACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY.\nYou are not permitted to copy material from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them as your own work. Any copied material MUST appear in quotation marks or italics and MUST be accompanied by a citation to the original source. Failure to do this violates CMU\u2019s Policy on Academic Integrity, which states, \u201cIn all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources is required. \u2026 Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals without proper attribution or citation. Unique ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be graded.\u201d\nIt is a violation of academic integrity for you to assist anyone else in violating the policy or to provide your work to others to assist them. Because team deliverables are the product of joint work, it is the responsibility of each member of a team to ensure that all team materials have been produced in conformance with CMU policies. Credit cannot be given for work that is not a student\u2019s own. Therefore, if one member of a team violates a policy, for example, by copying material from the Internet without indicating its source, then no one on the team can receive credit for that work, even if only one student is directly guilty of violating the policy.\nWe are aware that acts that constitute cheating can be viewed very differently in different countries and cultures. However, Carnegie Mellon is a U.S. university and its policies reflect U.S. culture. Employers expect that students who graduate from Carnegie Mellon have obtained their degree legitimately and according to Carnegie Mellon policies. If you have any doubt whether proposed conduct would be considered cheating under Carnegie Mellon policies, ASK A FACULTY MEMBER OR THE DIRECTOR FIRST.\nAll violations of the Academic Integrity policy MUST be reported to the University administration by the faculty members involved. Copies go to the Program Director, the Head of the Language Technology Institute, the Associate Dean for Master\u2019s Programs, and various officials at Warner Hall. The faculty do not have the option to decline to make a report. The offending student will receive an email to inform them of an Academic Integrity Violation (AIV). The email will specify the offense and the penalty, and will inform the student of available appeal procedures. An AIV that is successfully appealed is erased.\nImportant note: The university policy gives a department the option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.\u201d The LTI has a \u201ctwo strikes\u201d rule. The LTI may terminate a student for a first violation, depending upon the circumstances and severity of the violation. The LTI always terminates a student for a second violation, with no exceptions.\n19\n\n\n4 Academic Policies\n4.1 Course Registration\n4.1.1 Status\nAll Students must be registered for at least 48 units during each semester. Any questions about registration should be directed to the Enrollment Services (the HUB). Note that International students are required to be registered as full-time students, minimum 36 units.\n4.1.2 Academic Calendar\nThe Academic Calendar can be found at www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar.html. All dates about registration, add/drop deadlines, university holidays and more can be found there.\n4.1.3 Online Registration\nAll new students will already be registered for required courses and will be able to register for electives during the MSAII orientation session. After that, students will register following the schedule set by the HUB. Note that students must meet with their advisor to obtain approval for their course selection. Registration information is available at www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/registration/index.html. Online registration is done with an Andrew ID at www.cmu.edu/hub/sio.\nStudents must register for at least 48 units per semester.\n4.1.4 Pass/No Pass Courses (Pass/Fail)\nWith the approval of the Program Director, a graduate student may choose to take an ELECTIVE course pass/no pass. Core courses and Knowledge courses may not be taken pass/no pass. By the deadline for changing a course to pass/no pass, the student must fill out the Pass/No Pass Approval Form and receive permission from the course\u2019s instructor. Classes taken pass/no pass cannot be used to fulfill graduation requirements, and pass/no pass status is irrevocable. (A form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html)\n4.1.5 Auditing a Course\nWith the approval of the Program Director, a graduate student may audit a course by obtaining the permission of the instructor or teaching department and completing the Course Audit Approval Form. Audited classes are not taken for credit and cannot be used to fulfill graduation req"}
