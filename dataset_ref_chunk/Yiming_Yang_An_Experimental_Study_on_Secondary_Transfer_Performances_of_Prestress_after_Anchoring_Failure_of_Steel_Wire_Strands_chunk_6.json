The con\ufb01nement effect of stirrups on concrete can effectively improve the ultimate compressive strength of concrete and delay the occurrence of splitting cracks. This improves the bond strength between the concrete and steel strands, thereby reducing the secondary transfer length of residual prestress. The initial effective pre-tension of S1, S5, and S6 are set as 497 kN for the corrosion test simulation. The stress distribution of reinforcement cages with different diameters when the end anchoring of one side of the specimen fails are shown in Figure 13. As indicated, although S1 reaches the maximum stress value of 77.6 MPa among these three specimens, this value is still at a low stress level. This means that the con\ufb01nement of the stirrup on the concrete is relatively small, and the effect of the stirrup on the secondary transfer of residual prestress is not signi\ufb01cant. In other words, the stirrups do not fully exert their con\ufb01nement effect in this case. Therefore, increasing the diameter of stirrups has no signi\ufb01cant effect on the secondary transfer length before the splitting cracks appear in the concrete. 15 of 19 Metals 2023, 13, 1489 Figure 13.

Conclusions The secondary transfer behaviors of residual prestress after corrosion and fracture failure at the anchoring end on one side of six different post-tensioning prestressed concrete specimens were studied through an experiment in this study. The in\ufb02uences of concrete strength, stirrup con\ufb01guration, and length of components on the secondary transfer of prestress and anchoring performances were analyzed. The calculation method of the sec- ondary transfer of residual prestress was discussed preliminarily. Some major conclusions can be drawn: (1) After the corrosion fracture of the steel wire strand at the end anchoring, shrinkage and slippage occurred in the stranded wire. Due to the bonding action between the concrete and the strands, the strain of the steel wire strand on the corrosion side of all specimens decreases quickly, and the strain changes within a certain length range are close to zero. Similar to the pre-tensioning method, the residual prestress of the steel wire strand at the end of the corrosion fracture process can realize effective secondary transfer within a certain range when it has good bonding performance with concrete. (2) Although residual prestress can undergo a secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of the steel wire strand, effective prestress will decrease in all specimens. The loss ratio of prestress is negatively related to concrete strength. The lower the concrete strength, the higher the loss ratio of prestress. The stirrup diameter can slightly in\ufb02uence the effective prestress after transfer. (3) The secondary transfer length of residual prestress is signi\ufb01cantly correlated with concrete tensile strength. A higher concrete strength leads to a smaller secondary transfer length. When the thickness of the protective cover exceeds \ufb01ve times the diameter of prestressed tendons, the structure develops no splitting failure. Stirrup area changes in\ufb02uence the secondary transfer length slightly. (4) Whether secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of steel wire strand is deter- mined by their bond performances. In the existing standards, the calculation of the secondary transfer length of residual prestress in the steel wire strand is too conserva- tive and safe. The calculation method of the secondary transfer length based on the principle of equal actual stress and bond force of steel wire strands has a relatively high calculation accuracy. The average error and maximum error are only 2.58% and 5.2%, respectively.

The con\ufb01nement effect of stirrups on concrete can effectively improve the ultimate compressive strength of concrete and delay the occurrence of splitting cracks. This improves the bond strength between the concrete and steel strands, thereby reducing the secondary transfer length of residual prestress. The initial effective pre-tension of S1, S5, and S6 are set as 497 kN for the corrosion test simulation. The stress distribution of reinforcement cages with different diameters when the end anchoring of one side of the specimen fails are shown in Figure 13. As indicated, although S1 reaches the maximum stress value of 77.6 MPa among these three specimens, this value is still at a low stress level. This means that the con\ufb01nement of the stirrup on the concrete is relatively small, and the effect of the stirrup on the secondary transfer of residual prestress is not signi\ufb01cant. In other words, the stirrups do not fully exert their con\ufb01nement effect in this case. Therefore, increasing the diameter of stirrups has no signi\ufb01cant effect on the secondary transfer length before the splitting cracks appear in the concrete. 15 of 19 Metals 2023, 13, 1489 Figure 13.

Conclusions The secondary transfer behaviors of residual prestress after corrosion and fracture failure at the anchoring end on one side of six different post-tensioning prestressed concrete specimens were studied through an experiment in this study. The in\ufb02uences of concrete strength, stirrup con\ufb01guration, and length of components on the secondary transfer of prestress and anchoring performances were analyzed. The calculation method of the sec- ondary transfer of residual prestress was discussed preliminarily. Some major conclusions can be drawn: (1) After the corrosion fracture of the steel wire strand at the end anchoring, shrinkage and slippage occurred in the stranded wire. Due to the bonding action between the concrete and the strands, the strain of the steel wire strand on the corrosion side of all specimens decreases quickly, and the strain changes within a certain length range are close to zero. Similar to the pre-tensioning method, the residual prestress of the steel wire strand at the end of the corrosion fracture process can realize effective secondary transfer within a certain range when it has good bonding performance with concrete. (2) Although residual prestress can undergo a secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of the steel wire strand, effective prestress will decrease in all specimens. The loss ratio of prestress is negatively related to concrete strength. The lower the concrete strength, the higher the loss ratio of prestress. The stirrup diameter can slightly in\ufb02uence the effective prestress after transfer. (3) The secondary transfer length of residual prestress is signi\ufb01cantly correlated with concrete tensile strength. A higher concrete strength leads to a smaller secondary transfer length. When the thickness of the protective cover exceeds \ufb01ve times the diameter of prestressed tendons, the structure develops no splitting failure. Stirrup area changes in\ufb02uence the secondary transfer length slightly. (4) Whether secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of steel wire strand is deter- mined by their bond performances. In the existing standards, the calculation of the secondary transfer length of residual prestress in the steel wire strand is too conserva- tive and safe. The calculation method of the secondary transfer length based on the principle of equal actual stress and bond force of steel wire strands has a relatively high calculation accuracy.

The con\ufb01nement effect of stirrups on concrete can effectively improve the ultimate compressive strength of concrete and delay the occurrence of splitting cracks. This improves the bond strength between the concrete and steel strands, thereby reducing the secondary transfer length of residual prestress. The initial effective pre-tension of S1, S5, and S6 are set as 497 kN for the corrosion test simulation. The stress distribution of reinforcement cages with different diameters when the end anchoring of one side of the specimen fails are shown in Figure 13. As indicated, although S1 reaches the maximum stress value of 77.6 MPa among these three specimens, this value is still at a low stress level. This means that the con\ufb01nement of the stirrup on the concrete is relatively small, and the effect of the stirrup on the secondary transfer of residual prestress is not signi\ufb01cant. In other words, the stirrups do not fully exert their con\ufb01nement effect in this case. Therefore, increasing the diameter of stirrups has no signi\ufb01cant effect on the secondary transfer length before the splitting cracks appear in the concrete. 15 of 19 Metals 2023, 13, 1489 Figure 13.

Conclusions The secondary transfer behaviors of residual prestress after corrosion and fracture failure at the anchoring end on one side of six different post-tensioning prestressed concrete specimens were studied through an experiment in this study. The in\ufb02uences of concrete strength, stirrup con\ufb01guration, and length of components on the secondary transfer of prestress and anchoring performances were analyzed. The calculation method of the sec- ondary transfer of residual prestress was discussed preliminarily. Some major conclusions can be drawn: (1) After the corrosion fracture of the steel wire strand at the end anchoring, shrinkage and slippage occurred in the stranded wire. Due to the bonding action between the concrete and the strands, the strain of the steel wire strand on the corrosion side of all specimens decreases quickly, and the strain changes within a certain length range are close to zero. Similar to the pre-tensioning method, the residual prestress of the steel wire strand at the end of the corrosion fracture process can realize effective secondary transfer within a certain range when it has good bonding performance with concrete. (2) Although residual prestress can undergo a secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of the steel wire strand, effective prestress will decrease in all specimens. The loss ratio of prestress is negatively related to concrete strength. The lower the concrete strength, the higher the loss ratio of prestress. The stirrup diameter can slightly in\ufb02uence the effective prestress after transfer. (3) The secondary transfer length of residual prestress is signi\ufb01cantly correlated with concrete tensile strength. A higher concrete strength leads to a smaller secondary transfer length. When the thickness of the protective cover exceeds \ufb01ve times the diameter of prestressed tendons, the structure develops no splitting failure. Stirrup area changes in\ufb02uence the secondary transfer length slightly. (4) Whether secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of steel wire strand is deter- mined by their bond performances. In the existing standards, the calculation of the secondary transfer length of residual prestress in the steel wire strand is too conserva- tive and safe. The calculation method of the secondary transfer length based on the principle of equal actual stress and bond force of steel wire strands has a relatively high calculation accuracy. The average error and maximum error are only 2.58% and 5.2%, respectively.
