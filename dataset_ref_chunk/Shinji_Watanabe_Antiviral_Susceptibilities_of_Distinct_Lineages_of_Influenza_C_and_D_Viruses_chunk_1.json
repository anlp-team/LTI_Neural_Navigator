Four types exist: in\ufb02uenza A virus, in\ufb02uenza B virus, in- \ufb02uenza C virus, and in\ufb02uenza D virus. Three classes of antivirals have been approved for in\ufb02uenza treatment or prophylaxis in Japan: an M2 inhibitor (amantadine), neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir), and RNA polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir). Laninamivir and favipiravir are approved only in Japan. Because favipiravir increases the risk of teratogenicity and embryotoxicity, it received conditional marketing approval with strict regulations for its production and clinical use [1]. The M2 inhibitor blocks the M2 ion channel of in\ufb02uenza A viruses and inhibits virus uncoating [2]. The NA inhibitors bind to the NA enzyme active site of in- \ufb02uenza A and B viruses and inhibit virus release from infected cells [2].

Favipiravir acts as a chain terminator or a mutagen and inhibits RNA elongation, which is carried out by the PB1 subunit [4]. Antiviral-resistant influenza A viruses have emerged and spread globally. In 2003\u20132004, the prevalence of M2 inhibitor-resistant A(H3N2) viruses carrying an S31N substitution in the M2 protein increased markedly in China; these viruses spread globally during 2005\u20132006 [5]. Since the currently circulating in\ufb02uenza A viruses possess the M2 S31N substitution, the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend the use of the M2 inhibitors for the treatment or prevention of in\ufb02uenza A virus infections. In\ufb02uenza A(H1N1) viruses carrying an H275Y substitution in the NA protein, which confers cross- resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir, emerged in Europe during the 2007\u20132008 in\ufb02uenza season and spread globally within a year. In 2009, in\ufb02uenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, which were susceptible to NA inhibitors, emerged and replaced the NA H275Y mutant A(H1N1) viruses. Although a widespread cluster of baloxavir-resistant viruses has not been detected, human-to-human transmission of in\ufb02uenza A(H3N2) viruses carrying an I38T substitution in the PA protein, which confers resistance to baloxavir, has been reported [6\u20138]. The emergence and spread of antiviral-resistant viruses are of great concern. Because global surveillance of antiviral resistance is essential, the WHO Global In\ufb02uenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) Expert Working Group for Surveillance of Antiviral Susceptibility (WHO-AVWG) has been conducting a global analysis of circulating in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses for NA inhibitor and baloxavir susceptibilities by using a combination of phenotypic methods analyzing antiviral susceptibility and genotypic methods detecting amino acid substitutions associated with antiviral resistance [9]. In\ufb02uenza C and D viruses contain the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin-esterase- fusion (HEF), which combines the functions of the hemagglutinin (HA) and NA pro- teins of in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses.

Four types exist: in\ufb02uenza A virus, in\ufb02uenza B virus, in- \ufb02uenza C virus, and in\ufb02uenza D virus. Three classes of antivirals have been approved for in\ufb02uenza treatment or prophylaxis in Japan: an M2 inhibitor (amantadine), neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir), and RNA polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir). Laninamivir and favipiravir are approved only in Japan. Because favipiravir increases the risk of teratogenicity and embryotoxicity, it received conditional marketing approval with strict regulations for its production and clinical use [1]. The M2 inhibitor blocks the M2 ion channel of in\ufb02uenza A viruses and inhibits virus uncoating [2]. The NA inhibitors bind to the NA enzyme active site of in- \ufb02uenza A and B viruses and inhibit virus release from infected cells [2]. The in\ufb02uenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase consists of three subunits: polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA) in in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses or polymerase 3 protein (P3) in in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses.

Favipiravir acts as a chain terminator or a mutagen and inhibits RNA elongation, which is carried out by the PB1 subunit [4]. Antiviral-resistant influenza A viruses have emerged and spread globally. In 2003\u20132004, the prevalence of M2 inhibitor-resistant A(H3N2) viruses carrying an S31N substitution in the M2 protein increased markedly in China; these viruses spread globally during 2005\u20132006 [5]. Since the currently circulating in\ufb02uenza A viruses possess the M2 S31N substitution, the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend the use of the M2 inhibitors for the treatment or prevention of in\ufb02uenza A virus infections. In\ufb02uenza A(H1N1) viruses carrying an H275Y substitution in the NA protein, which confers cross- resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir, emerged in Europe during the 2007\u20132008 in\ufb02uenza season and spread globally within a year. In 2009, in\ufb02uenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, which were susceptible to NA inhibitors, emerged and replaced the NA H275Y mutant A(H1N1) viruses. Although a widespread cluster of baloxavir-resistant viruses has not been detected, human-to-human transmission of in\ufb02uenza A(H3N2) viruses carrying an I38T substitution in the PA protein, which confers resistance to baloxavir, has been reported [6\u20138]. The emergence and spread of antiviral-resistant viruses are of great concern. Because global surveillance of antiviral resistance is essential, the WHO Global In\ufb02uenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) Expert Working Group for Surveillance of Antiviral Susceptibility (WHO-AVWG) has been conducting a global analysis of circulating in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses for NA inhibitor and baloxavir susceptibilities by using a combination of phenotypic methods analyzing antiviral susceptibility and genotypic methods detecting amino acid substitutions associated with antiviral resistance [9]. In\ufb02uenza C and D viruses contain the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin-esterase- fusion (HEF), which combines the functions of the hemagglutinin (HA) and NA pro- teins of in\ufb02uenza A and B viruses. Based on the HEF gene sequences, in\ufb02uenza C and D viruses are classi\ufb01ed into six (C/Taylor, C/Yamagata, C/Sao Paulo, C/Aichi, C/Kanagawa, and C/Mississippi) [10] and \ufb01ve (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, D/Yama2019, and D/CA2019) [11] lineages, respectively.
