A prediction model of the effective stress transfer length of prestressed steel wire strand after failure was proposed. The results demonstrated that residual prestress can have a secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of end-anchored steel wire strands, but some effective prestress may be lost. Moreover, the loss of prestress is inversely proportional to concrete compressive strength. When the specimens are relatively short, the prestress loss increases significantly. Concrete strength has significant influences on the length of secondary transfer.

Patients and Methods One hundred and thirty patients with HCC who underwent preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and curative hepatic resection were retrospectively reviewed. Two radiologists reviewed all preoperative MR images and assessed the radiological features of HCCs. The ability of peritumoral HBP hypointensity to identify MVI and intrahepatic recurrence was analyzed.

Results Peritumoral HBP hypointensity (odds ratio, 3.019; 95% confidence interval: 1.071\u20138.512; P=0.037) was an independent predictor of MVI.
