Case Study of Haze Pollution from 8 to 15 February 2020 We investigated the effects of the vertical motion of the boundary layer on particulate matter and its optical properties during an extreme haze event and the link between the vertical distribution of aerosols and the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer. Based on observations from the Raman\u2013Mie scattering LiDAR and sun photometer combined with meteorological data, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of an extreme haze event in Beijing from 8 to 15 February 2020.

Meteorological Conditions within the Boundary Layer Figure 4 shows the variation of the PM2.5 mass concentration, the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent at 440\u2013870 nm (AE440\u2013870nm), the AOD, the boundary layer height, the temperature, the relative humidity, the wind direction and the wind speed in urban Beijing from 8 to 15 February 2020. Figure 4a shows that a heavy pollution event occurred in Beijing from February 8 to 15. Pollutants began to accumulate from about midnight on February 8, when the PM2.5 mass concentration increased suddenly from 15 to 180 \u00b5g m\u22123 and then remained steady at about 120 \u00b5g m\u22123. The concentration of pollutants increased suddenly from about 09:00 to 12:00 on 11 February, when the PM2.5 mass concentration increased from 120 to 250 \u00b5g m\u22123, after which it remained at around 240 \u00b5g m\u22123. Precipitation occurred in the Beijing area from the afternoon of 13 February to 14 February and the pollutants gradually cleared via wet deposition. The PM2.5 mass concentration decreased and the pollution event ended. We focus here on two cumulative growth processes of pollutants: from 12:00 on 8 February to 01:00 on 9 February (PE1) and from 18:00 on 10 February to 18:00 on 11 February (PE2). We analyzed the in\ufb02uence of the vertical motion of the boundary layer on particulate matter and its optical properties during HPEs and the connection between the vertical distribution of aerosols and the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer. Figure 4 shows that the near-surface wind speed was low in PE1 and mainly dominated by westerly and easterly winds. The PM2.5 mass concentration increased rapidly from 15 to 180 \u00b5g m\u22123 and the AOD showed an increasing trend similar to that of PM2.5. The boundary layer height showed a \ufb02uctuating decreasing trend, which was in\ufb02uenced by the combined effect of the daily variation in the boundary layer and the aerosol radiation effect [21]. The near-surface temperature had a clear daily trend, with the minimum temperature increasing from \u22129 to \u22123 \u25e6C at the beginning of the period of relative pollution, indicating that the presence of an aerosol particle layer at night enhances the downward counter-radiation in the atmosphere and heats the underlying atmosphere, increasing the daily minimum temperature [79]. The changes in the relative humidity and PM2.5 both showed an increasing trend. The change in the relative humidity was in\ufb02uenced by the daily change in the water vapor content and temperature [80]. Before sunset, the amount of shortwave radiation reaching the near-surface decreased as a result of aerosol extinction [21]. The near-surface region therefore cooled down, the saturated water vapor pressure decreased and the relative humidity gradually increased [80]. After sunset, the temperature near the ground gradually decreased and therefore the saturated water vapor pressure also decreased, resulting in a gradual increase in the relative humidity [80]. In PE2, the near-surface region was in a static state with a wind speed <2 m s\u22121. The temperature and relative humidity showed clear daily variations, but the minimum value of the relative humidity increased from 30% on 10 February to about 45% on 11 February and the maximum temperature decreased from 13 to about 11 \u25e6C. This suggests that the amount of solar radiation reaching the near-surface decreased as a result of the extinction effect of pollutants, which led to a decrease in the near-surface temperature and an increase in the relative humidity [50,51]. The PM2.5 mass concentration increased rapidly from 120 \u00b5g m\u22123 to about 250 \u00b5g m\u22123 at 09:00\u201312:00 on 11 February, whereas the boundary layer height decreased from 1.1 to about 0.6 km. This was caused by the accumulation of pollutants leading to radiative cooling near the ground, lowering the surface temperature and forming or enhancing the inverse temperature lamination. This inhibited the diffusion of vertical turbulence and led to a decrease in the boundary layer height [54,55]. 8 of 22 about 0.6 km.

Pollutants began to accumulate from about midnight on February 8, when the PM2.5 mass concentration increased suddenly from 15 to 180 \u00b5g m\u22123 and then remained steady at about 120 \u00b5g m\u22123. The concentration of pollutants increased suddenly from about 09:00 to 12:00 on 11 February, when the PM2.5 mass concentration increased from 120 to 250 \u00b5g m\u22123, after which it remained at around 240 \u00b5g m\u22123. Precipitation occurred in the Beijing area from the afternoon of 13 February to 14 February and the pollutants gradually cleared via wet deposition. The PM2.5 mass concentration decreased and the pollution event ended. We focus here on two cumulative growth processes of pollutants: from 12:00 on 8 February to 01:00 on 9 February (PE1) and from 18:00 on 10 February to 18:00 on 11 February (PE2). We analyzed the in\ufb02uence of the vertical motion of the boundary layer on particulate matter and its optical properties during HPEs and the connection between the vertical distribution of aerosols and the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer. Figure 4 shows that the near-surface wind speed was low in PE1 and mainly dominated by westerly and easterly winds. The PM2.5 mass concentration increased rapidly from 15 to 180 \u00b5g m\u22123 and the AOD showed an increasing trend similar to that of PM2.5. The boundary layer height showed a \ufb02uctuating decreasing trend, which was in\ufb02uenced by the combined effect of the daily variation in the boundary layer and the aerosol radiation effect [21]. The near-surface temperature had a clear daily trend, with the minimum temperature increasing from \u22129 to \u22123 \u25e6C at the beginning of the period of relative pollution, indicating that the presence of an aerosol particle layer at night enhances the downward counter-radiation in the atmosphere and heats the underlying atmosphere, increasing the daily minimum temperature [79]. The changes in the relative humidity and PM2.5 both showed an increasing trend. The change in the relative humidity was in\ufb02uenced by the daily change in the water vapor content and temperature [80]. Before sunset, the amount of shortwave radiation reaching the near-surface decreased as a result of aerosol extinction [21]. The near-surface region therefore cooled down, the saturated water vapor pressure decreased and the relative humidity gradually increased [80]. After sunset, the temperature near the ground gradually decreased and therefore the saturated water vapor pressure also decreased, resulting in a gradual increase in the relative humidity [80]. In PE2, the near-surface region was in a static state with a wind speed <2 m s\u22121. The temperature and relative humidity showed clear daily variations, but the minimum value of the relative humidity increased from 30% on 10 February to about 45% on 11 February and the maximum temperature decreased from 13 to about 11 \u25e6C. This suggests that the amount of solar radiation reaching the near-surface decreased as a result of the extinction effect of pollutants, which led to a decrease in the near-surface temperature and an increase in the relative humidity [50,51]. The PM2.5 mass concentration increased rapidly from 120 \u00b5g m\u22123 to about 250 \u00b5g m\u22123 at 09:00\u201312:00 on 11 February, whereas the boundary layer height decreased from 1.1 to about 0.6 km. This was caused by the accumulation of pollutants leading to radiative cooling near the ground, lowering the surface temperature and forming or enhancing the inverse temperature lamination. This inhibited the diffusion of vertical turbulence and led to a decrease in the boundary layer height [54,55]. 8 of 22 about 0.6 km.

In PE2, the near-surface region was in a static state with a wind speed <2 m s\u22121. The temperature and relative humidity showed clear daily variations, but the minimum value of the relative humidity increased from 30% on 10 February to about 45% on 11 February and the maximum temperature decreased from 13 to about 11 \u25e6C. This suggests that the amount of solar radiation reaching the near-surface decreased as a result of the extinction effect of pollutants, which led to a decrease in the near-surface temperature and an increase in the relative humidity [50,51]. The PM2.5 mass concentration increased rapidly from 120 \u00b5g m\u22123 to about 250 \u00b5g m\u22123 at 09:00\u201312:00 on 11 February, whereas the boundary layer height decreased from 1.1 to about 0.6 km. This was caused by the accumulation of pollutants leading to radiative cooling near the ground, lowering the surface temperature and forming or enhancing the inverse temperature lamination. This inhibited the diffusion of vertical turbulence and led to a decrease in the boundary layer height [54,55]. 8 of 22 about 0.6 km.

Case Study of Haze Pollution from 8 to 15 February 2020 We investigated the effects of the vertical motion of the boundary layer on particulate matter and its optical properties during an extreme haze event and the link between the vertical distribution of aerosols and the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer. Based on observations from the Raman\u2013Mie scattering LiDAR and sun photometer combined with meteorological data, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of an extreme haze event in Beijing from 8 to 15 February 2020.

Figure 4a shows that a heavy pollution event occurred in Beijing from February 8 to 15. Pollutants began to accumulate from about midnight on February 8, when the PM2.5 mass concentration increased suddenly from 15 to 180 \u00b5g m\u22123 and then remained steady at about 120 \u00b5g m\u22123. The concentration of pollutants increased suddenly from about 09:00 to 12:00 on 11 February, when the PM2.5 mass concentration increased from 120 to 250 \u00b5g m\u22123, after which it remained at around 240 \u00b5g m\u22123. Precipitation occurred in the Beijing area from the afternoon of 13 February to 14 February and the pollutants gradually cleared via wet deposition. The PM2.5 mass concentration decreased and the pollution event ended. We focus here on two cumulative growth processes of pollutants: from 12:00 on 8 February to 01:00 on 9 February (PE1) and from 18:00 on 10 February to 18:00 on 11 February (PE2). We analyzed the in\ufb02uence of the vertical motion of the boundary layer on particulate matter and its optical properties during HPEs and the connection between the vertical distribution of aerosols and the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer. Figure 4 shows that the near-surface wind speed was low in PE1 and mainly dominated by westerly and easterly winds. The PM2.5 mass concentration increased rapidly from 15 to 180 \u00b5g m\u22123 and the AOD showed an increasing trend similar to that of PM2.5. The boundary layer height showed a \ufb02uctuating decreasing trend, which was in\ufb02uenced by the combined effect of the daily variation in the boundary layer and the aerosol radiation effect [21]. The near-surface temperature had a clear daily trend, with the minimum temperature increasing from \u22129 to \u22123 \u25e6C at the beginning of the period of relative pollution, indicating that the presence of an aerosol particle layer at night enhances the downward counter-radiation in the atmosphere and heats the underlying atmosphere, increasing the daily minimum temperature [79]. The changes in the relative humidity and PM2.5 both showed an increasing trend. The change in the relative humidity was in\ufb02uenced by the daily change in the water vapor content and temperature [80].
