Consistent with the results of the mi-gration nursery, the number and types of volatile substances in Schisandra chinensis dried fruits are signi\ufb01cantly higher than those in Schisandra chinensis branch sap, indicating that the aroma of Schisandra chinensis dried fruits is richer than that of branch sap. W1 and W2 have high similarity, W4 and W5 have high similarity, and the \ufb01ngerprint spectra of white and yellow fruits are more similar. Figure 3. Fingerprint spectra of white, yellow, and red Schisandra chinensis branch sap. Figure 4. Fingerprint spectra of white, yellow, and red Schisandra chinensis dried fruits. 2.3. Classi\ufb01cation of Volatile Chemical Substances in Branch Sap and Dried Fruits The volatile compounds in dried fruits and branch exudates can be classi\ufb01ed into alkenes, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, and others (as shown in Figure 5). Overall, the amount of volatile substances detected in dried fruits is higher than that in branch exudates. Among them, alkenes, alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes are present in high amounts in dried fruits. The volatile components in branch exudates are mainly alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes. Alkenes are the high-content volatile substances in dried fruits. The total amount of volatile substances in white and yellow fruits is relatively high, both in dried fruits and branch exudates. The content of alkenes is the highest in W4 and W5. In the corresponding W1 and W2, the content of ketones is the highest, followed by Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 18 internal standard. By comparing the actual retention index and ion drift time of di\ufb00erent substances with the database, it is possible to compare volatile chemical substances. The peak volume of volatile chemical substances is calculated, and the concentration of chem-ical substances can be obtained by calculating using the internal standard method, achiev-ing quanti\ufb01cation of chemical substances in di\ufb00erent samples. Volatile compounds that are not identi\ufb01ed are represented by numerical codes. As shown in Figures 3 and 4, the di\ufb00erence in the content of each substance can be intuitively seen from the depth of the colors on the \ufb01ngerprint spectra. The establishment of \ufb01ngerprint spectra visualizes the spectral data and directly helps in the directional se- lection of germplasm resources rich in special chemical substances (odor thresholds: com- 2.2. Qualitative Analysis of Volatile Chemical Substances in White, Yellow, and Red Fruit Branch Sap and Dried Fruits The VoCal software 0.4.03built into the \ufb02avor analyzer is used to analyze the ion migration spectra. The NIST and IMS databases built into the software are used to organize and compare the original data in the GC-IMS spectra to obtain the \ufb01ngerprint spectra of the sample\u2019s volatile chemical substances. The experiment uses 4-methyl-2-pentanol as an internal standard. By comparing the actual retention index and ion drift time of different substances with the database, it is possible to compare volatile chemical substances. The peak volume of volatile chemical substances is calculated, and the concentration of chemical substances can be obtained by calculating using the internal standard method, achieving quanti\ufb01cation of chemical substances in different samples. Volatile compounds that are not identi\ufb01ed are represented by numerical codes. As shown in Figures 3 and 4, the difference in the content of each substance can be intuitively seen from the depth of the colors on the \ufb01ngerprint spectra. The establishment of \ufb01ngerprint spectra visualizes the spectral data and directly helps in the directional selection of germplasm resources rich in special chemical substances (odor thresholds: compilations of odor threshold values in air, water, and other media (edition 2011)).
