SIMULATION RESULTS A symmetrical monopole hybrid MMC-HVDC link is built in Matlab/Simulink to verify the proposed method. Parameters are given in Table II. The dc fault detection time is selected as a typical value of 3 ms. A dc side pole-to-pole short circuit fault occurs at t = 0.5 s, and SMs start to block at t = 0.503 s. Fig. 3(a) shows that after all SMs are blocked, the dc voltage becomes negative, and the dc current is decreased. The ac currents increase and then start to decrease. The fault currents are concentrated in two arms. The maximum arm current is 3.385 kA. FB-SM voltages increase a lot. The maximum FB- SM voltage is 2.525 kV. HB-SM voltages are not changed after SM blocking. IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Experiments have been conducted using a three-phase hybrid MMC, as shown in Fig. 4. Parameters of the experiment setup are given in Table II. For the safety of the experiment setup, the overcurrent protection is used. In this case, the converter starts to clear the dc fault current once the dc current reaches 17 A. Fig. 5(a) shows the experiment results of the conventional SM blocking method (all SMs are blocked) [1], [9], [12]. After SM blocking, the dc voltage becomes negative, and the dc fault current decreases. The maximum arm current is 14 A, and the highest FB-SM voltage is 160 V.

SIMULATION RESULTS A symmetrical monopole hybrid MMC-HVDC link is built in Matlab/Simulink to verify the proposed method. Parameters are given in Table II. The dc fault detection time is selected as a typical value of 3 ms. A dc side pole-to-pole short circuit fault occurs at t = 0.5 s, and SMs start to block at t = 0.503 s. Fig. 3(a) shows that after all SMs are blocked, the dc voltage becomes negative, and the dc current is decreased. The ac currents increase and then start to decrease. The fault currents are concentrated in two arms. The maximum arm current is 3.385 kA. FB-SM voltages increase a lot. The maximum FB- SM voltage is 2.525 kV. HB-SM voltages are not changed after SM blocking. IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Experiments have been conducted using a three-phase hybrid MMC, as shown in Fig. 4. Parameters of the experiment setup are given in Table II. For the safety of the experiment setup, the overcurrent protection is used. In this case, the converter starts to clear the dc fault current once the dc current reaches 17 A. Fig. 5(a) shows the experiment results of the conventional SM blocking method (all SMs are blocked) [1], [9], [12]. After SM blocking, the dc voltage becomes negative, and the dc fault current decreases. The maximum arm current is 14 A, and the highest FB-SM voltage is 160 V.
