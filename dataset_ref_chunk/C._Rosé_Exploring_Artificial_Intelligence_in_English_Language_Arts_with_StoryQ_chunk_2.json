Appropriate responses to emotions must be programmed by humans. Big Idea #5. Societal Impact: AI can impact \u2022 society in both positive and negative ways. AI technologies are changing the ways we work, travel, communicate, and care for each other. But we must be mindful of the harms that can potentially occur. For example, biases in the data used to train an AI system could lead to some people being less well served than others. Thus, it is important to discuss the impacts that AI is having on our society and develop criteria for the ethical design and deployment of AI-based systems. This module uses StoryQ, a code-free web-based machine learning and text mining tool as the primary learning tool. While many tools exist for professional NLP work (e.g., R and Python packages), tools for learning in this domain have been very limited, especially for younger learners with inadequate math and CS foundations. One such example is Machine Learning for Kids (Lane n.d.) modeling environment, which offers a tool for young learners to train text classification models. While adequate Representation: Feature Extraction StoryQ visualizes how text is represented as features. Figure 1 shows that when a unigram (single word) extraction method is applied to training data, some words such as \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201ctry\u201d are extracted as a list of features, while other words, punctuation, and emojis are removed due to certain inclusion criteria. This feature list is the representation of the original text. Although it is not as readable for humans, it captures the meanings underlying the target label (in this case, words like \u201cgreat\u201d indicate positive sentiment). the learning algorithm's choices when Figure 1: StoryQ visualizes features extracted from any document. Representation: Feature Space StoryQ extracts features from all documents (Figure 2.a) and compiles them into one feature table (a.k.a. feature space) and summarizes their frequencies associated with each label (Figure 2.b). Students can select any feature (e.g., the word \u201cgreat\u201d) in the feature table and examine how the feature is used in each document (Figure 2.c) and how the feature is distributed across the two labels (Figure 2.d). This linking between the data, feature table, and feature distribution graph allows students to gain a deep understanding of how models represent knowledge and the inevitable loss of meanings as perceived by humans. 16001 Machine Learning: Model Performance Similarly, students can see how model performance changes over iterations. Figure 4 shows a confusion matrix of documents correctly or incorrectly predicted by the model. As the ML algorithm runs, the model becomes more accurate with a higher level of \u201cconfidence\u201d for the majority of documents. Figure 2: StoryQ generates a feature table that is dynamically linked with training data and feature distribution graph. Machine Learning: Feature Weights StoryQ allows learners to step through an ML algorithm and observe how the internal representation of a model (i.e., feature weights) changes as the algorithm iteratively searches for better model performance. Figure 3 shows all features as points mapped on a weight scale. As the algorithm proceeds through more iterations, the feature weights become more spread out. For example, features \u201clike\u201d and \u201cgreat\u201d start with weights of -0.01 and 0.05, quite close to each other, and eventually move far apart: - 0.24 and 0.46, respectively.

This parallels the process machine learning algorithms use to make sense of the English language. In machine learning, a program determines the weights of different features within the text to create a predictive model for labeling future text. In this eight-lesson module, students embark on a journey to make sense of how creating artificial intelligence using machine learning tools and techniques requires a strong command of English language arts skills. Students build on their knowledge of the English language to analyze the ways humans use language and to determine strategies for sorting text examples into discrete categories. Using the StoryQ text classification models (e.g., if a light should be turned on or off depending on the command) and seek to discover which features the model was trained to respond to. They also learn how to extract their own features, train their own model, and then use graphical representations to analyze the success of the model. Students also iteratively improve their models by analyzing the error cases to see what was overlooked or which features may have been ambiguous.

Students can select any feature (e.g., the word \u201cgreat\u201d) in the feature table and examine how the feature is used in each document (Figure 2.c) and how the feature is distributed across the two labels (Figure 2.d).
