As shown in Figure 15, both GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product can capture well the variation in monthly BC column concentration over the NEI region. Spe-cifically, GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product presents the same trend of BC column concentration with high values in November, December, and January, whereas low values in July, August, and September.

Indo\u2013China Peninsula The comparisons of BC column concentration between GRASP/Component BC re-trieval and MERRA-2 BC over the Indo\u2013China Peninsula (ICP) region are represented in Figure 16. The temporal variation in monthly BC column concentration over the ICP re-gion for the calculation of regional means is reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product with good consistencies. Specifically, GRASP/Com-ponent BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product present very high BC column concentra-tion in April and May, whereas low BC column concentration in July. The correlation co-efficient of R = 0.89 together with RMSE = 1.30 mg/m2 (in Table 4) are obtained between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the ICP region. The differ-ences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the ICP region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval throughout the year, with the absolute differences varying from 0.4 mg/m2 to 1.7 mg/m2 and the relative differences varying from 21.0% to 77.4%.

Northeast India Figure 15 shows the comparisons of BC column concentration in Northeast India (NEI) region between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product. As shown in Figure 15, both GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product can capture well the variation in monthly BC column concentration over the NEI region. Spe-cifically, GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product presents the same trend of BC column concentration with high values in November, December, and January, whereas low values in July, August, and September. The correlation coefficient of R = 0.72 together with RMSE = 2.31 mg/m2 (in Table 4) is found between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the NEI region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the NEI region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 presents approximately 60~85% higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval throughout the year. The absolute minimum difference of 1.4 mg/m2 is recorded in July when BC column concentration reaches the lowest values reflected by both GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC prod-uct.

Specifically, GRASP/Com-ponent BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product present very high BC column concentra-tion in April and May, whereas low BC column concentration in July. The correlation co-efficient of R = 0.89 together with RMSE = 1.30 mg/m2 (in Table 4) are obtained between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the ICP region. The differ-ences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the ICP region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval throughout the year, with the absolute differences varying from 0.4 mg/m2 to 1.7 mg/m2 and the relative differences varying from 21.0% to 77.4%. Figure 16. Same as Figure 13, but for Indo\u2013China Peninsula (ICP) region. 3.2.5. North China Plain Figure 17 presents the comparisons of BC column concentration between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product over the North China Plain (NCP) region. As shown in Figure 17, although both GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product can describe the variation in monthly BC column concentration over the NCP region, large discrepancies are found for all months except in June. The Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 388 16 of 22 was obtained in December. The BC column concentration over the SOA region in August, re\ufb02ected by GRASP/Component retrievals and MERRA-2 products, are almost the same. Figure 14. Same as Figure 13, but for Southern Africa (SOA) region. 3.2.3. Northeast India Figure 15 shows the comparisons of BC column concentration in Northeast India (NEI) region between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product. As shown in Figure 15, both GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product can capture well the variation in monthly BC column concentration over the NEI region. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product presents the same trend of BC column concentration with high values in November, December, and January, whereas low values in July, August, and September. The correlation coef\ufb01cient of R = 0.72 together with RMSE = 2.31 mg/m2 (in Table 4) is found between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the NEI region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the NEI region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 presents approximately 60~85% higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval throughout the year. The absolute minimum difference of 1.4 mg/m2 is recorded in July when BC column concentration reaches the lowest values re\ufb02ected by both GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product.
