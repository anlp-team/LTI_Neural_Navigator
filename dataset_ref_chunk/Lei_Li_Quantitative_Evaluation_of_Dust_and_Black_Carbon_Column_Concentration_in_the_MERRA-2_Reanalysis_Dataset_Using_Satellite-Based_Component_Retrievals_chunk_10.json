Arabian Sea The differences in dust column concentration over the Arabian Sea (ARA) region are presented in Figure 11. On a regional means, the temporal variation in dust column concentration between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is in very good agreement over the ARA region. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in June and July, whereas there are low values in November, December, and January. The statistics in the comparisons are also investigated for the regional dust column concentration (in Table 2). A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.98) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the ARA region with RMSE = 89.48 mg/m2. It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 11. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the ARA region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in July (186.8 mg/m2) and the relative difference in August (44.2%). The absolute minimum difference and relative difference were recorded simultaneously in December (9.2 mg/m2 and 21.8%, respectively). Figure 11. Same as Figure 3, but for Arabian Sea (ARA) region. 3.1.10. Bay of Bengal Figure 12 presents the comparisons of dust column concentration over another down- wind Bay of Bengal (BOB) region. As shown in Figure 12, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentration over the BOB region. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high val- ues in May, June, and July. However, low values are retrieved in November, December, and January from satellite observations, whereas low values are obtained in October, November, and December from the MERRA-2 dataset. The correlation coef\ufb01cient of R = 0.84 together with RMSE = 29.61 mg/m2 (in Table 2) is found between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the BOB region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that over the BOB region, the dust column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component dust re- trieval from February to May; however, lower concentration for other months (from June to January). The maximum absolute differences of \u221237.7 mg/m2 and \u221237.1 mg/m2 (negative values indicate MERRA-2 dust column concentration is lower than GRASP/Component dust column concentration) are obtained in September and June, respectively, as well as the maximum relative difference of \u2212177.8% (negative values indicate MERRA-2 dust column concentration are lower than GRASP/Component dust column concentration) is obtained Figure 12.

Specifically, GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product presents the same trend of BC column concentration with high values in December and January and low values in April and May. The statistics in the comparisons for the regional BC column concentration are listed in Table 4. A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.92) and low RMSE = 0.66 mg/m2 are recorded between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the SUS region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. It is worth mentioning that over the SUS region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC re-trieval from March to November; however, lower during the months of December, Janu-ary, and February. The maximum absolute difference of \u22121.0 mg/m2 (negative values in-dicate MERRA-2 BC column concentration is lower than GRASP/Component BC column concentration) is obtained in January, as well as the maximum relative difference of 70.5% is obtained in May.

Arabian Sea The differences in dust column concentration over the Arabian Sea (ARA) region are presented in Figure 11. On a regional means, the temporal variation in dust column concentration between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is in very good agreement over the ARA region. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in June and July, whereas there are low values in November, December, and January. The statistics in the comparisons are also investigated for the regional dust column concentration (in Table 2). A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.98) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the ARA region with RMSE = 89.48 mg/m2. It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 11. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the ARA region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in July (186.8 mg/m2) and the relative difference in August (44.2%). The absolute minimum difference and relative difference were recorded simultaneously in December (9.2 mg/m2 and 21.8%, respectively). Figure 11. Same as Figure 3, but for Arabian Sea (ARA) region. 3.1.10. Bay of Bengal Figure 12 presents the comparisons of dust column concentration over another down- wind Bay of Bengal (BOB) region. As shown in Figure 12, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentration over the BOB region. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high val- ues in May, June, and July. However, low values are retrieved in November, December, and January from satellite observations, whereas low values are obtained in October, November, and December from the MERRA-2 dataset. The correlation coef\ufb01cient of R = 0.84 together with RMSE = 29.61 mg/m2 (in Table 2) is found between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the BOB region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that over the BOB region, the dust column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component dust re- trieval from February to May; however, lower concentration for other months (from June to January). The maximum absolute differences of \u221237.7 mg/m2 and \u221237.1 mg/m2 (negative values indicate MERRA-2 dust column concentration is lower than GRASP/Component dust column concentration) are obtained in September and June, respectively, as well as the maximum relative difference of \u2212177.8% (negative values indicate MERRA-2 dust column concentration are lower than GRASP/Component dust column concentration) is obtained Figure 12.

Sub-Sahel Figure 13 presents the comparisons of BC column concentration over the Sub-Sahel (SUS) region. We can see that both GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product can capture well the variation in monthly BC column concentration over the SUS region. Specifically, GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product presents the same trend of BC column concentration with high values in December and January and low values in April and May. The statistics in the comparisons for the regional BC column concentration are listed in Table 4. A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.92) and low RMSE = 0.66 mg/m2 are recorded between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the SUS region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. It is worth mentioning that over the SUS region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC re-trieval from March to November; however, lower during the months of December, Janu-ary, and February. The maximum absolute difference of \u22121.0 mg/m2 (negative values in-dicate MERRA-2 BC column concentration is lower than GRASP/Component BC column concentration) is obtained in January, as well as the maximum relative difference of 70.5% is obtained in May.
