However, the K value of the crack tip at the bottom of the corrosion pit is always signi\ufb01cantly higher than the value at both ends. The crack propagation rate reaches its maximum when it propagates to the bottom of the pit. From the perspective of the whole crack tip section, when the crack tip extends to the left edge of the pit, the K of the crack tip near the pit edge is the highest. This is different from the distribution of K at the crack tip of the non-corroded specimen. This shows that the specimen with a corrosion pit is in a dangerous stress state under the action of fatigue load. Figure 17. The stress state of the crack tip for the pit at a depth of 0.75 B. Figure 18 shows a diagram of the stress state of the crack tip at the end of crack propagation in the corrosion pit. It shows that the K value of the crack tip gradually decreases from the side with the corrosion pit (from 2 or 1 in Figure 17) to the other side, specimen with a corrosion pit is in a dangerous stress state under the action of fatigue load. Figure 18 shows a diagram of the stress state of the crack tip at the end of crack prop-agation in the corrosion pit. It shows that the K value of the crack tip gradually decreases from the side with the corrosion pit (from 2 or 1 in Figure 17) to the other side, and the stress is still the highest near the pit. This indicates that the corrosion pit around the crack propagation surface will reach the yield state \ufb01rst, and a stronger stress \ufb01eld can be ob-served near the crack tip. Figure 17.

Conclusions In this study, the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance steel was experimentally investigated. The fatigue crack growth performance of Q550 was compared with that of Q235. The e\ufb00ects of some factors, such as the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting, on crack propagation were numerically studied. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: 1. The crack growth rate of Q550E is obviously higher than that of Q235 in the late stage of crack growth. The crack propagation life of Q550E is reduced by about 18% when corroded, as compared to intact specimens. The crack growth curve associated with corrosion pitting is divided into three stages, but it has little in\ufb02uence on the crack propagation path. 2. A higher crack depth ratio easily leads to a higher K value, which, in turn, a\ufb00ects the structural life. The critical angle in the initial crack propagation process is 52.5\u00b0, and K is signi\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ected by the initial crack angle once this critical value is exceeded. When the initial crack angle is 0\u00b0, the crack tip stress is maximized, and fractures are Metals 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 16 of 18 Metals 2023, 13, 1496 16 of 18 and the stress is still the highest near the pit. This indicates that the corrosion pit around the crack propagation surface will reach the yield state \ufb01rst, and a stronger stress \ufb01eld can be observed near the crack tip. Figure 18.

A higher crack depth ratio easily leads to a higher K value, which, in turn, affects the structural life. The critical angle in the initial crack propagation process is 52.5\u25e6, and K is signi\ufb01cantly affected by the initial crack angle once this critical value is exceeded. When the initial crack angle is 0\u25e6, the crack tip stress is maximized, and fractures are most likely to occur. Otherwise, the crack initiation angle tends to expand perpendicular to the load direction. The stress ratio is directly proportional to the crack length and inversely proportional to the stress intensity factor. The thickness has an obvious"}
