Mineral dust particles emitted from the Saharan and Middle East-ern deserts to the Mediterranean are demonstrated by the observations [6,49,52,59], which can be attributed to the nocturnal low-level jets, Harmattan surge, and Mediterranean de-pressions [60,61]. Figure 10 shows the comparison of dust column concentration between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the MED region. We can see that both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can cap-ture well the variation in monthly dust column concentration over the MED region. Spe-cifically, in the MED region, high dust column concentrations are revealed by both GRASP/Component dust retrievals and MERRA-2 dust products in April and May, as well as low values recorded in November, December, and January. A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.88) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust prod-uct is obtained in the MED region with RMSE = 82.34 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 10. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentra-tion in the MED region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust re-trieval, with the maximum absolute difference in April (131.5 mg/m2) and the maximum relative difference in March (60.0%). The absolute minimum difference was obtained in January (29.7 mg/m2), together with a minimum relative difference of 38.3% in February. The estimation of nocturnal low-level jets, Harmattan surge, and Mediterranean depres-sions in the model employed by MERRA-2 could make contributions to the differences. Figure 10. Same as Figure 3, but for Mediterranean Basin (MED) region. 3.1.9. Arabian Sea The differences in dust column concentration over the Arabian Sea (ARA) region are presented in Figure 11. On a regional means, the temporal variation in dust column con-centration between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is in very good agreement over the ARA region. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust re-trieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in June and July, whereas there are low values in November, December, and January. The statistics in the comparisons are also investigated for the regional dust column concentration (in Table 2). A good correlation coefficient (R = 0.98) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the ARA region with RMSE = 89.48 mg/m2. It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 11.

As shown in Figure 12, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentration over the BOB region. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust re-trieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in May, June, and July. However, low values are retrieved in November, December, and January from satellite observations, whereas low values are obtained in October, November, and December from the MERRA-2 dataset. The correlation coeffi-cient of R = 0.84 together with RMSE = 29.61 mg/m2 (in Table 2) is found between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the BOB region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3.
