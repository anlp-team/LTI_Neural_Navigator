This is not always feasible. On the other hand, the inverse problem of parameter estimation of phonation models is quite dif\ufb01cult to solve through purely computational means. For example, in order to estimate the parameters of a vocal tract (VT) model, one must take into account the vocal tract coupling, the effect of the lossy medium that comprises the walls of the vocal tract, lip radiation, etc. Without serious approximations, the inverse problem in this case becomes eventually intractable. Some approaches simplify the solution by discretizing the vocal tract as a sequence of consecutive tubes of varying cross-sectional area, or with a mesh-grid. However, these approximations invariably increase the estimation error. This paper proposes a methodology for solving the inverse problem of phonation models through purely computational means. As mentioned earlier, the methodology follows an analysis-by-synthesis approach. We explain this by \ufb01rst reviewing our previously proposed Adjoint Least Squares Estimation (ADLES) algorithm [31] that estimates the parameters of a VFO model by minimizing the error between a reference glottal \ufb02ow waveform and the signal generated by the physical VFO model. We then describe our proposed ADLES-VFT algorithm to estimate the parameters of a joint VFO and VT model (also called a body-cover model). Instead of comparing the model-generated excitation at the glottis to a reference glottal \ufb02ow, the \ufb02ow is propagated through the vocal tract to generate a signal at the lips, which is compared to a recorded voice signal which is used as a reference. The algorithm proposed iteratively re-estimates the model parameters by minimizing the error between the reference voice sample and this generated signal. Once estimated, these parameters are used with the VFO model to generate the speaker\u2019s VFOs. 3. Vocal Folds, Vocal Tract and Joint Models In this section we describe the VFO and VT models that we use as examples in this paper. We also explain the formulation of the joint model that we ultimately use to solve the inverse problem of parameter estimation. 3.1. The VFO Model A schematic illustration of a general mass-spring oscillator model for the vocal folds is shown in Figure 2. This is used to model the phonation process as described below. 4 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Figure 2. Approximating the vocal folds with mass-spring oscillators in the phonation process. Air\ufb02ow from the lungs, driven by the subglottal pressure Ps, passes through the glottis, and vocal folds are set into a state of self-sustained vibration, producing the glottal \ufb02ow ug which is a quasi- periodic pressure wave. The vibration of vocal folds is analogous to a pair of mass-spring-damper oscillators. Further, the glottal \ufb02ow resonates in the speaker\u2019s vocal tract and nasal tract and produces voiced sound. One-mass models describe the vibration of the vocal folds as that of a single mass- damper-spring oscillator. M \u00a8x + B \u02d9x + Kx = f (x, \u02d9x, t) where x is lateral displacement of a mass M, B and K are damping and stiffness coef\ufb01cients, respectively, f is the driving force, and t is time [2]. The driving force is velocity-dependent and can be estimated by Bernoulli\u2019s energy law: Pg = Ps \u2212 1 2 \u03c1v2 where Pg is the mean glottal pressure, Ps is sub-glottal pressure, \u03c1 is air density, and v is the air particle velocity. The kinetic pressure in the supra-glottal region is neglected [2]. Other models, namely two-mass, multi-mass and \ufb01nite element models can also be used as the basis for the VFO model, and are described brie\ufb02y in the Appendix A for reference. For our paper, we adopt the version of the one-mass model of the vocal folds proposed in [24], illustrated in Figure 3. This is an asymmetric body-cover model which models the left and right vocal folds individually as one-mass components of a coupled dynamical system. It incorporates an asymmetry parameter, which can emulate the asymmetry in the vibratory motions of left and right vocal folds, and hence is also ideally suited to modeling pathological or atypical phonation [32]. The key assumptions made in formulating this model are: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) The degree of asymmetry is independent of the oscillation frequency; The glottal \ufb02ow is stationary, frictionless, and incompressible; All subglottal and supraglottal loads are neglected, eliminating the effect of source- vocal tract interaction; There is no glottal closure and hence no vocal fold collision during the oscillation cycle; The small-amplitude body-cover assumption is applicable (see de\ufb01nition below). 5 of 39 (1) (2) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Figure 3. Diagram of the one-mass body-cover model for vocal folds. The lateral displacements at the midpoint of the left and right vocal folds are denoted as \u03bel and \u03ber, and \u03be0 represents the half glottal width at rest. Assumption 1 (Body-cover assumption). The body-cover assumption assumes that a glottal \ufb02ow- induced mucosal wave travels upwards within the transglottal region, causing a small displacement of the mucosal tissue, which attenuates down within a few millimeters into the tissue as an energy exchange happens between the airstream and the tissue [2]. This assumption allows us to represent the mucosal wave as a one-dimensional surface wave on the mucosal surface (the cover) and treat the remainder of the vocal folds (the body) as a single mass or safely neglect it. As a result, the oscillation model can be linearized, and the oscillatory conditions are much simpli\ufb01ed while maintaining the model\u2019s accuracy. In the one-mass asymmetric model proposed in [24], with reference to Figure 3, the center-line of the glottis is denoted as the z-axis. At the midpoint (z = 0) of the thickness of the vocal folds, the left and right vocal folds oscillate with lateral displacement \u03bel and \u03ber, resulting in a pair of coupled Van der Pol oscillators: \u00a8\u03ber + \u03b2(1 + \u03be2 \u00a8\u03bel + \u03b2(1 + \u03be2 r )"}, {"question": " Why is it not always feasible to take actual physical measurements of vocal fold oscillations?", "answer": " It is not always feasible due to the difficulty of solving the inverse problem of parameter estimation of phonation models through purely computational means.", "ref_chunk": "of such models, the traditional solution has been to take actual physical measurements of the vocal fold oscillations, or of the glottal \ufb02ow using techniques such as high-speed videostroboscopy, as mentioned in Section 1.

The body-cover assumption assumes that a glottal \ufb02ow- induced mucosal wave travels upwards within the transglottal region, causing a small displacement of the mucosal tissue, which attenuates down within a few millimeters into the tissue as an energy exchange happens between the airstream and the tissue [2]. This assumption allows us to represent the mucosal wave as a one-dimensional surface wave on the mucosal surface (the cover) and treat the remainder of the vocal folds (the body) as a single mass or safely neglect it. As a result, the oscillation model can be linearized, and the oscillatory conditions are much simpli\ufb01ed while maintaining the model\u2019s accuracy. In the one-mass asymmetric model proposed in [24], with reference to Figure 3, the center-line of the glottis is denoted as the z-axis. At the midpoint (z = 0) of the thickness of the vocal folds, the left and right vocal folds oscillate with lateral displacement \u03bel and \u03ber, resulting in a pair of coupled Van der Pol oscillators: \u00a8\u03ber + \u03b2(1 + \u03be2 \u00a8\u03bel + \u03b2(1 + \u03be2 r )"}, {"question": " What key assumptions are made in formulating the one-mass body-cover model for vocal folds?", "answer": " The key assumptions include independence of asymmetry degree from oscillation frequency, stationary and frictionless glottal flow, neglect of subglottal and supraglottal loads, absence of glottal closure, and applicability of the small-amplitude body-cover assumption.", "ref_chunk": "of such models, the traditional solution has been to take actual physical measurements of the vocal fold oscillations, or of the glottal \ufb02ow using techniques such as high-speed videostroboscopy, as mentioned in Section 1.

For example, in order to estimate the parameters of a vocal tract (VT) model, one must take into account the vocal tract coupling, the effect of the lossy medium that comprises the walls of the vocal tract, lip radiation, etc. Without serious approximations, the inverse problem in this case becomes eventually intractable. Some approaches simplify the solution by discretizing the vocal tract as a sequence of consecutive tubes of varying cross-sectional area, or with a mesh-grid. However, these approximations invariably increase the estimation error. This paper proposes a methodology for solving the inverse problem of phonation models through purely computational means.

We explain this by \ufb01rst reviewing our previously proposed Adjoint Least Squares Estimation (ADLES) algorithm [31] that estimates the parameters of a VFO model by minimizing the error between a reference glottal \ufb02ow waveform and the signal generated by the physical VFO model. We then describe our proposed ADLES-VFT algorithm to estimate the parameters of a joint VFO and VT model (also called a body-cover model). Instead of comparing the model-generated excitation at the glottis to a reference glottal \ufb02ow, the \ufb02ow is propagated through the vocal tract to generate a signal at the lips, which is compared to a recorded voice signal which is used as a reference. The algorithm proposed iteratively re-estimates the model parameters by minimizing the error between the reference voice sample and this generated signal. Once estimated, these parameters are used with the VFO model to generate the speaker\u2019s VFOs. 3. Vocal Folds, Vocal Tract and Joint Models In this section we describe the VFO and VT models that we use as examples in this paper. We also explain the formulation of the joint model that we ultimately use to solve the inverse problem of parameter estimation. 3.1. The VFO Model A schematic illustration of a general mass-spring oscillator model for the vocal folds is shown in Figure 2. This is used to model the phonation process as described below. 4 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Figure 2. Approximating the vocal folds with mass-spring oscillators in the phonation process. Air\ufb02ow from the lungs, driven by the subglottal pressure Ps, passes through the glottis, and vocal folds are set into a state of self-sustained vibration, producing the glottal \ufb02ow ug which is a quasi- periodic pressure wave. The vibration of vocal folds is analogous to a pair of mass-spring-damper oscillators. Further, the glottal \ufb02ow resonates in the speaker\u2019s vocal tract and nasal tract and produces voiced sound. One-mass models describe the vibration of the vocal folds as that of a single mass- damper-spring oscillator. M \u00a8x + B \u02d9x + Kx = f (x, \u02d9x, t) where x is lateral displacement of a mass M, B and K are damping and stiffness coef\ufb01cients, respectively, f is the driving force, and t is time [2]. The driving force is velocity-dependent and can be estimated by Bernoulli\u2019s energy law: Pg = Ps \u2212 1 2 \u03c1v2 where Pg is the mean glottal pressure, Ps is sub-glottal pressure, \u03c1 is air density, and v is the air particle velocity. The kinetic pressure in the supra-glottal region is neglected [2]. Other models, namely two-mass, multi-mass and \ufb01nite element models can also be used as the basis for the VFO model, and are described brie\ufb02y in the Appendix A for reference. For our paper, we adopt the version of the one-mass model of the vocal folds proposed in [24], illustrated in Figure 3. This is an asymmetric body-cover model which models the left and right vocal folds individually as one-mass components of a coupled dynamical system. It incorporates an asymmetry parameter, which can emulate the asymmetry in the vibratory motions of left and right vocal folds, and hence is also ideally suited to modeling pathological or atypical phonation [32]. The key assumptions made in formulating this model are: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) The degree of asymmetry is independent of the oscillation frequency; The glottal \ufb02ow is stationary, frictionless, and incompressible; All subglottal and supraglottal loads are neglected, eliminating the effect of source- vocal tract interaction; There is no glottal closure and hence no vocal fold collision during the oscillation cycle; The small-amplitude body-cover assumption is applicable (see de\ufb01nition below). 5 of 39 (1) (2) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Figure 3.

It incorporates an asymmetry parameter, which can emulate the asymmetry in the vibratory motions of left and right vocal folds, and hence is also ideally suited to modeling pathological or atypical phonation [32]. The key assumptions made in formulating this model are: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) The degree of asymmetry is independent of the oscillation frequency; The glottal \ufb02ow is stationary, frictionless, and incompressible; All subglottal and supraglottal loads are neglected, eliminating the effect of source- vocal tract interaction; There is no glottal closure and hence no vocal fold collision during the oscillation cycle; The small-amplitude body-cover assumption is applicable (see de\ufb01nition below). 5 of 39 (1) (2) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Figure 3. Diagram of the one-mass body-cover model for vocal folds. The lateral displacements at the midpoint of the left and right vocal folds are denoted as \u03bel and \u03ber, and \u03be0 represents the half glottal width at rest. Assumption 1 (Body-cover assumption). The body-cover assumption assumes that a glottal \ufb02ow- induced mucosal wave travels upwards within the transglottal region, causing a small displacement of the mucosal tissue, which attenuates down within a few millimeters into the tissue as an energy exchange happens between the airstream and the tissue [2]. This assumption allows us to represent the mucosal wave as a one-dimensional surface wave on the mucosal surface (the cover) and treat the remainder of the vocal folds (the body) as a single mass or safely neglect it. As a result, the oscillation model can be linearized, and the oscillatory conditions are much simpli\ufb01ed while maintaining the model\u2019s accuracy. In the one-mass asymmetric model proposed in [24], with reference to Figure 3, the center-line of the glottis is denoted as the z-axis. At the midpoint (z = 0) of the thickness of the vocal folds, the left and right vocal folds oscillate with lateral displacement \u03bel and \u03ber, resulting in a pair of coupled Van der Pol oscillators: \u00a8\u03ber + \u03b2(1 + \u03be2 \u00a8\u03bel + \u03b2(1 + \u03be2 r )"}], "doc_text": "of such models, the traditional solution has been to take actual physical measurements of the vocal fold oscillations, or of the glottal \ufb02ow using techniques such as high-speed videostroboscopy, as mentioned in Section 1. This is not always feasible. On the other hand, the inverse problem of parameter estimation of phonation models is quite dif\ufb01cult to solve through purely computational means. For example, in order to estimate the parameters of a vocal tract (VT) model, one must take into account the vocal tract coupling, the effect of the lossy medium that comprises the walls of the vocal tract, lip radiation, etc. Without serious approximations, the inverse problem in this case becomes eventually intractable. Some approaches simplify the solution by discretizing the vocal tract as a sequence of consecutive tubes of varying cross-sectional area, or with a mesh-grid. However, these approximations invariably increase the estimation error. This paper proposes a methodology for solving the inverse problem of phonation models through purely computational means. As mentioned earlier, the methodology follows an analysis-by-synthesis approach. We explain this by \ufb01rst reviewing our previously proposed Adjoint Least Squares Estimation (ADLES) algorithm [31] that estimates the parameters of a VFO model by minimizing the error between a reference glottal \ufb02ow waveform and the signal generated by the physical VFO model. We then describe our proposed ADLES-VFT algorithm to estimate the parameters of a joint VFO and VT model (also called a body-cover model). Instead of comparing the model-generated excitation at the glottis to a reference glottal \ufb02ow, the \ufb02ow is propagated through the vocal tract to generate a signal at the lips, which is compared to a recorded voice signal which is used as a reference. The algorithm proposed iteratively re-estimates the model parameters by minimizing the error between the reference voice sample and this generated signal. Once estimated, these parameters are used with the VFO model to generate the speaker\u2019s VFOs. 3. Vocal Folds, Vocal Tract and Joint Models In this section we describe the VFO and VT models that we use as examples in this paper. We also explain the formulation of the joint model that we ultimately use to solve the inverse problem of parameter estimation. 3.1. The VFO Model A schematic illustration of a general mass-spring oscillator model for the vocal folds is shown in Figure 2. This is used to model the phonation process as described below. 4 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Figure 2. Approximating the vocal folds with mass-spring oscillators in the phonation process. Air\ufb02ow from the lungs, driven by the subglottal pressure Ps, passes through the glottis, and vocal folds are set into a state of self-sustained vibration, producing the glottal \ufb02ow ug which is a quasi- periodic pressure wave. The vibration of vocal folds is analogous to a pair of mass-spring-damper oscillators. Further, the glottal \ufb02ow resonates in the speaker\u2019s vocal tract and nasal tract and produces voiced sound. One-mass models describe the vibration of the vocal folds as that of a single mass- damper-spring oscillator. M \u00a8x + B \u02d9x + Kx = f (x, \u02d9x, t) where x is lateral displacement of a mass M, B and K are damping and stiffness coef\ufb01cients, respectively, f is the driving force, and t is time [2]. The driving force is velocity-dependent and can be estimated by Bernoulli\u2019s energy law: Pg = Ps \u2212 1 2 \u03c1v2 where Pg is the mean glottal pressure, Ps is sub-glottal pressure, \u03c1 is air density, and v is the air particle velocity. The kinetic pressure in the supra-glottal region is neglected [2]. Other models, namely two-mass, multi-mass and \ufb01nite element models can also be used as the basis for the VFO model, and are described brie\ufb02y in the Appendix A for reference. For our paper, we adopt the version of the one-mass model of the vocal folds proposed in [24], illustrated in Figure 3. This is an asymmetric body-cover model which models the left and right vocal folds individually as one-mass components of a coupled dynamical system. It incorporates an asymmetry parameter, which can emulate the asymmetry in the vibratory motions of left and right vocal folds, and hence is also ideally suited to modeling pathological or atypical phonation [32].
