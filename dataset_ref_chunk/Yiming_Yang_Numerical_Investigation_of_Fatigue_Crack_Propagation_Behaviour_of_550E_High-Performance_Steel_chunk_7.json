Stress Ratio Previous studies have shown that stress ratios of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 can well demon- strate the effect of stress ratios on crack propagation [24]. For this reason, these stress ratios with a thickness of 10 mm and a load of 36 kN were used in the FEM to study the relationship between the crack propagation length, cycle times, and the K value. As shown in Figure 14, whether the steel is corroded or not, the stress ratio is directly proportional to the crack length and inversely proportional to the stress intensity factor.

This is because the effective length of the crack tip decreases when the crack propagation length is about to reach the corrosion pit. This leads to a sudden increase in crack tip stress and, in turn, to a sudden change in the crack propagation rate. 4.3.4. Thickness According to ASTM E647-15, the thickness B of the CT specimen should be between W\u204420 and W\u20444. Considering the information in the related literature [24], steel samples with thicknesses of 5 mm, 8 mm, and 10 mm with a load of 7 kN and a stress ratio of 0.1 were used to study the effect of thickness on the crack propagation. As shown in Figure 15, an increase in thickness leads to a downward curve shift in the K\u2013a relationship, which shows that the thickness is inversely proportional to K. When the thickness was 10mm, the variation in K was the lowest, and the extreme difference occurred at 595.18 MPa\u00b7mm1/2.

When the thickness was 10mm, the variation in K was the lowest, and the extreme di\ufb00erence occurred at 595.18 MPa\u2219mm(cid:2869)/(cid:2870). For the K\u2013N curves, the stress intensity factors at the ini-tial fracture of the crack tip for these thicknesses were 923.96 MPa\u2219mm(cid:2869)/(cid:2870), 589.01 MPa\u2219mm(cid:2869)/(cid:2870), and 482.32 MPa\u2219mm(cid:2869)/(cid:2870), respectively. Obviously, halving the thickness from 10 mm to 5 mm led to an increase in K. The numbers of cycles that began to develop rapidly when the thickness reached 8 mm and 10 mm were roughly 133,761 and 335,330, respec-tively. This indicates that a smaller stress intensity factor of crack tip fracture appears when the thickness is greater, and the critical value of rapid fracture cycles gradually in-creases, that is, the steel is less likely to fracture. In the a\u2013N relationship, increasing the thickness resulted in a lower crack growth rate. For the same number of cycles, the exten-sion length decreases as the thickness increases. Therefore, as the thickness increases, the K value of the crack tip at the stress concentration position reaches a maximum. Combined with the theoretical formula for K, the thickness a\ufb00ects K in the crack propagation area and signi\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ects the crack growth rate.

Stress diagram of crack propagation with different crack depth ratios of (A) 0.2, (B) 0.25, (C) 0.3, (D) 0.35, (E) 0.4, and (F) 0.45. 4.3.3. Stress Ratio Previous studies have shown that stress ratios of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 can well demon- strate the effect of stress ratios on crack propagation [24]. For this reason, these stress ratios with a thickness of 10 mm and a load of 36 kN were used in the FEM to study the relationship between the crack propagation length, cycle times, and the K value. As shown in Figure 14, whether the steel is corroded or not, the stress ratio is directly proportional to the crack length and inversely proportional to the stress intensity factor. The curves of corroded specimens \ufb02uctuated and experienced a sharp\u2013slow\u2013sharp growth process. This is because the effective length of the crack tip decreases when the crack propagation length is about to reach the corrosion pit. This leads to a sudden increase in crack tip stress and, in turn, to a sudden change in the crack propagation rate. 4.3.4. Thickness According to ASTM E647-15, the thickness B of the CT specimen should be between W\u204420 and W\u20444. Considering the information in the related literature [24], steel samples with thicknesses of 5 mm, 8 mm, and 10 mm with a load of 7 kN and a stress ratio of 0.1 were used to study the effect of thickness on the crack propagation. As shown in Figure 15, an increase in thickness leads to a downward curve shift in the K\u2013a relationship, which shows that the thickness is inversely proportional to K. When the thickness was 10mm, the variation in K was the lowest, and the extreme difference occurred at 595.18 MPa\u00b7mm1/2.

Considering the information in the related literature [24], steel samples with thicknesses of 5 mm, 8 mm, and 10 mm with a load of 7 kN and a stress ratio of 0.1 were used to study the e\ufb00ect of thickness on the crack propagation.

When the thickness was 10mm, the variation in K was the lowest, and the extreme di\ufb00erence occurred at 595.18 MPa\u2219mm(cid:2869)/(cid:2870). For the K\u2013N curves, the stress intensity factors at the ini-tial fracture of the crack tip for these thicknesses were 923.96 MPa\u2219mm(cid:2869)/(cid:2870), 589.01 MPa\u2219mm(cid:2869)/(cid:2870), and 482.32 MPa\u2219mm(cid:2869)/(cid:2870), respectively. Obviously, halving the thickness from 10 mm to 5 mm led to an increase in K. The numbers of cycles that began to develop rapidly when the thickness reached 8 mm and 10 mm were roughly 133,761 and 335,330, respec-tively. This indicates that a smaller stress intensity factor of crack tip fracture appears when the thickness is greater, and the critical value of rapid fracture cycles gradually in-creases, that is, the steel is less likely to fracture. In the a\u2013N relationship, increasing the thickness resulted in a lower crack growth rate. For the same number of cycles, the exten-sion length decreases as the thickness increases. Therefore, as the thickness increases, the K value of the crack tip at the stress concentration position reaches a maximum. Combined with the theoretical formula for K, the thickness a\ufb00ects K in the crack propagation area and signi\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ects the crack growth rate.

Considering the information in the related literature [24], steel samples with thicknesses of 5 mm, 8 mm, and 10 mm with a load of 7 kN and a stress ratio of 0.1 were used to study the e\ufb00ect of thickness on the crack propagation. As shown in Figure 15, an increase in thickness leads to a downward curve shift in the K\u2013a relationship, which shows that the thickness is inversely proportional to K. When the thickness was 10mm, the variation in K was the lowest, and the extreme di\ufb00erence occurred at 595.18 MPa\u2219mm(cid:2869)/(cid:2870). For the K\u2013N curves, the stress intensity factors at the ini-tial fracture of the crack tip for these thicknesses were 923.96 MPa\u2219mm(cid:2869)/(cid:2870), 589.01 MPa\u2219mm(cid:2869)/(cid:2870), and 482.32 MPa\u2219mm(cid:2869)/(cid:2870), respectively. Obviously, halving the thickness from 10 mm to 5 mm led to an increase in K. The numbers of cycles that began to develop rapidly when the thickness reached 8 mm and 10 mm were roughly 133,761 and 335,330, respec-tively. This indicates that a smaller stress intensity factor of crack tip fracture appears when the thickness is greater, and the critical value of rapid fracture cycles gradually in-creases, that is, the steel is less likely to fracture. In the a\u2013N relationship, increasing the thickness resulted in a lower crack growth rate. For the same number of cycles, the exten-sion length decreases as the thickness increases. Therefore, as the thickness increases, the K value of the crack tip at the stress concentration position reaches a maximum. Combined with the theoretical formula for K, the thickness a\ufb00ects K in the crack propagation area and signi\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ects the crack growth rate.
