The increasing trends presented by both PM2.5 and AOD440nm were not synchronized in time. The PM2.5 mass concentration increased about 2.1 times from 09:00 (about 120 \u03bcg m\u22123) to 12:00 (about 250 \u03bcg m\u22123) on 11 February, whereas the AOD440nm increased about four times from 18:00 (about 0.4) on 10 February to 09:00 (about 1.6) on 11 February (Figure 4). Figure 4 shows that the increase in the AOD was synchronized with the increase in the relative humidity. The increase in the AOD may be because, at high particle concentrations (about Remote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 22 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 475 9 of 22 Figure 4.

The arrows indicate explosive increase in PM mass concentration. The AOD440nm increased from 0.4 to 1.6 from about 18:00 on 10 February to 08:00 on 11 February, whereas the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent increased from 1.2 to 1.6, indicating that the accumulation of pollutants during PE2 was dominated by \ufb01ne particles [14]. The increasing trends presented by both PM2.5 and AOD440nm were not synchronized in time. The PM2.5 mass concentration increased about 2.1 times from 09:00 (about 120 \u00b5g m\u22123) to 12:00 (about 250 \u00b5g m\u22123) on 11 February, whereas the AOD440nm increased about four times from 18:00 (about 0.4) on 10 February to 09:00 (about 1.6) on 11 February (Figure 4). Figure 4 shows that the increase in the AOD was synchronized with the increase in the relative humidity. The increase in the AOD may be because, at high particle concentrations (about 120 \u00b5g m\u22123), the hygroscopic growth of a large number of \ufb01ne particles with increasing relative humidity increases the scattering of particles [32]. The increases in the SSA at 675, 870 and 1020 nm all showed different degrees of growth. The vertical pro\ufb01le of the extinction coef\ufb01cient also showed different degrees of growth at each height, especially at the lowest layer, where there was an increase of about 3.3 times from 0.6 to 2.0 (Figure S1). This led to a decrease in the amount of radiation reaching the Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 475 near-surface and an increase in the amount of radiation trapped in the boundary layer. This strengthened the inversion layer in the boundary layer and suppressed the development of turbulence. The height of the boundary layer decreased from 1.1 to 0.6 km from 09:00 to 12:00 on 11 February (Figure 4). Particulate matter accumulated continuously from high altitudes to the near-surface, which promoted the rapid growth in the mass concentration of PM2.5. The vertical transport of particulate matter may also explain the lack of synchroniza- tion in the incremental trends presented by the AOD440nm and the PM2.5 mass concen- tration. The PM2.5 mass concentration is measured with the micro-oscillation balance and \u03b2-absorption methods [81], which respond to the near-surface mass concentration of PM2.5, whereas the AOD re\ufb02ects the whole aerosol column [21]. The pollutants may be suspended in the atmosphere, resulting in low PM2.5 mass concentrations from near-surface observations, while the AOD shows an increasing trend. Figure S1 shows that the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient at 1\u20131.5 km continued to grow from 18:00 on February 10 to about 10:00 on 11 February. The aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient increased from about 0.1 to 0.3 km\u22121 at 1 km height and the high-value region of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient (>0.3 km\u22121) gradually thickened from <1 km to about 1.25 km, indicating the continuous accumulation of pollutants between 1 and 1.5 km. At the height of 1000 hPa, the Beijing area was located on the eastern side of a region of high pressure system and the near-surface winds were mainly northerly. With an eastward shift in the region of high pressure, the wind speed gradually decreased at the near-surface and was relatively stable, and the strengthening of the sinking air\ufb02ow in Beijing. From 00:03 to 12:00 on 11 February, there was a sinking air\ufb02ow with a wind speed of about 0.5 m s\u22121 between 0 and 1.5 km, which continuously transported pollutants from altitudes of 1\u20131.5 km to the near-surface. This promoted the rapid increase in pollutants. Figure 5 shows the contribution of CAPE to the variation in the PM2.5 concentration. When the CAPE is negative, the diffusion of pollutants is inhibited and is expressed by the CIN [62,63]. During PE1 and PE2, the atmosphere had a stable strati\ufb01cation at 08:00 and 20:00 and the diffusion of pollutants was inhibited. The temperature within the boundary layer (1000\u2013900 hPa) gradually increased with height during PE2 at 08:00 and 20:00 on 10\u201311 February, showing an inverse temperature strati\ufb01cation. This further enhanced the accumulation of pollutants. The wind \ufb01eld is an important meteorological factor affecting the accumulation or dispersion of atmospheric pollutants [66]. Figures 6 and 7 show the horizontal wind \ufb01eld pro\ufb01les and vertical wind \ufb01eld plots, respectively, during this period of haze pollution. Positive values in the vertical wind \ufb01eld plots indicate a sinking air\ufb02ow and negative values indicate a rising air\ufb02ow. During PE1, Beijing was in the southeast of the low- pressure system from 12:00 to 18:00 and the near-surface winds were mainly southerly. Pollutants were continuously transported from southern Beijing to downtown Beijing, which accelerated the accumulation of pollutants [50]. With the eastward movement of the low-pressure system, the near-surface wind speed weakened and the lifting air\ufb02ow gradually strengthened. During PE2, the Beijing area was located on the eastern side of the high-pressure region and the near-surface winds were mainly northerly. The near-surface wind speed decreased with the eastward shift in the high-pressure region and the sinking air\ufb02ow was enhanced.

The AOD440nm increased from 0.4 to 1.6 from about 18:00 on 10 February to 08:00 on 11 February, whereas the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent increased from 1.2 to 1.6, indicating that the accumulation of pollutants during PE2 was dominated by \ufb01ne particles [14]. The increasing trends presented by both PM2.5 and AOD440nm were not synchronized in time. The PM2.5 mass concentration increased about 2.1 times from 09:00 (about 120 \u00b5g m\u22123) to 12:00 (about 250 \u00b5g m\u22123) on 11 February, whereas the AOD440nm increased about four times from 18:00 (about 0.4) on 10 February to 09:00 (about 1.6) on 11 February (Figure 4). Figure 4 shows that the increase in the AOD was synchronized with the increase in the relative humidity. The increase in the AOD may be because, at high particle concentrations (about 120 \u00b5g m\u22123), the hygroscopic growth of a large number of \ufb01ne particles with increasing relative humidity increases the scattering of particles [32]. The increases in the SSA at 675, 870 and 1020 nm all showed different degrees of growth. The vertical pro\ufb01le of the extinction coef\ufb01cient also showed different degrees of growth at each height, especially at the lowest layer, where there was an increase of about 3.3 times from 0.6 to 2.0 (Figure S1). This led to a decrease in the amount of radiation reaching the Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 475 near-surface and an increase in the amount of radiation trapped in the boundary layer. This strengthened the inversion layer in the boundary layer and suppressed the development of turbulence. The height of the boundary layer decreased from 1.1 to 0.6 km from 09:00 to 12:00 on 11 February (Figure 4). Particulate matter accumulated continuously from high altitudes to the near-surface, which promoted the rapid growth in the mass concentration of PM2.5. The vertical transport of particulate matter may also explain the lack of synchroniza- tion in the incremental trends presented by the AOD440nm and the PM2.5 mass concen- tration. The PM2.5 mass concentration is measured with the micro-oscillation balance and \u03b2-absorption methods [81], which respond to the near-surface mass concentration of PM2.5, whereas the AOD re\ufb02ects the whole aerosol column [21]. The pollutants may be suspended in the atmosphere, resulting in low PM2.5 mass concentrations from near-surface observations, while the AOD shows an increasing trend. Figure S1 shows that the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient at 1\u20131.5 km continued to grow from 18:00 on February 10 to about 10:00 on 11 February.

At the height of 1000 hPa, the Beijing area was located on the eastern side of a region of high pressure system and the near-surface winds were mainly northerly.

From 00:03 to 12:00 on 11 February, there was a sinking air\ufb02ow with a wind speed of about 0.5 m s\u22121 between 0 and 1.5 km, which continuously transported pollutants from altitudes of 1\u20131.5 km to the near-surface. This promoted the rapid increase in pollutants. Figure 5 shows the contribution of CAPE to the variation in the PM2.5 concentration. When the CAPE is negative, the diffusion of pollutants is inhibited and is expressed by the CIN [62,63]. During PE1 and PE2, the atmosphere had a stable strati\ufb01cation at 08:00 and 20:00 and the diffusion of pollutants was inhibited. The temperature within the boundary layer (1000\u2013900 hPa) gradually increased with height during PE2 at 08:00 and 20:00 on 10\u201311 February, showing an inverse temperature strati\ufb01cation. This further enhanced the accumulation of pollutants. The wind \ufb01eld is an important meteorological factor affecting the accumulation or dispersion of atmospheric pollutants [66]. Figures 6 and 7 show the horizontal wind \ufb01eld pro\ufb01les and vertical wind \ufb01eld plots, respectively, during this period of haze pollution.

Figure 4 shows that the increase in the AOD was synchronized with the increase in the relative humidity. The increase in the AOD may be because, at high particle concentrations (about Remote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 22 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 475 9 of 22 Figure 4.

The arrows indicate explosive increase in PM mass concentration. The AOD440nm increased from 0.4 to 1.6 from about 18:00 on 10 February to 08:00 on 11 February, whereas the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent increased from 1.2 to 1.6, indicating that the accumulation of pollutants during PE2 was dominated by \ufb01ne particles [14]. The increasing trends presented by both PM2.5 and AOD440nm were not synchronized in time. The PM2.5 mass concentration increased about 2.1 times from 09:00 (about 120 \u00b5g m\u22123) to 12:00 (about 250 \u00b5g m\u22123) on 11 February, whereas the AOD440nm increased about four times from 18:00 (about 0.4) on 10 February to 09:00 (about 1.6) on 11 February (Figure 4). Figure 4 shows that the increase in the AOD was synchronized with the increase in the relative humidity. The increase in the AOD may be because, at high particle concentrations (about 120 \u00b5g m\u22123), the hygroscopic growth of a large number of \ufb01ne particles with increasing relative humidity increases the scattering of particles [32]. The increases in the SSA at 675, 870 and 1020 nm all showed different degrees of growth. The vertical pro\ufb01le of the extinction coef\ufb01cient also showed different degrees of growth at each height, especially at the lowest layer, where there was an increase of about 3.3 times from 0.6 to 2.0 (Figure S1). This led to a decrease in the amount of radiation reaching the Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 475 near-surface and an increase in the amount of radiation trapped in the boundary layer. This strengthened the inversion layer in the boundary layer and suppressed the development of turbulence. The height of the boundary layer decreased from 1.1 to 0.6 km from 09:00 to 12:00 on 11 February (Figure 4). Particulate matter accumulated continuously from high altitudes to the near-surface, which promoted the rapid growth in the mass concentration of PM2.5. The vertical transport of particulate matter may also explain the lack of synchroniza- tion in the incremental trends presented by the AOD440nm and the PM2.5 mass concen- tration. The PM2.5 mass concentration is measured with the micro-oscillation balance and \u03b2-absorption methods [81], which respond to the near-surface mass concentration of PM2.5, whereas the AOD re\ufb02ects the whole aerosol column [21]. The pollutants may be suspended in the atmosphere, resulting in low PM2.5 mass concentrations from near-surface observations, while the AOD shows an increasing trend. Figure S1 shows that the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient at 1\u20131.5 km continued to grow from 18:00 on February 10 to about 10:00 on 11 February. The aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient increased from about 0.1 to 0.3 km\u22121 at 1 km height and the high-value region of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient (>0.3 km\u22121) gradually thickened from <1 km to about 1.25 km, indicating the continuous accumulation of pollutants between 1 and 1.5 km. At the height of 1000 hPa, the Beijing area was located on the eastern side of a region of high pressure system and the near-surface winds were mainly northerly. With an eastward shift in the region of high pressure, the wind speed gradually decreased at the near-surface and was relatively stable, and the strengthening of the sinking air\ufb02ow in Beijing. From 00:03 to 12:00 on 11 February, there was a sinking air\ufb02ow with a wind speed of about 0.5 m s\u22121 between 0 and 1.5 km, which continuously transported pollutants from altitudes of 1\u20131.5 km to the near-surface. This promoted the rapid increase in pollutants. Figure 5 shows the contribution of CAPE to the variation in the PM2.5 concentration. When the CAPE is negative, the diffusion of pollutants is inhibited and is expressed by the CIN [62,63]. During PE1 and PE2, the atmosphere had a stable strati\ufb01cation at 08:00 and 20:00 and the diffusion of pollutants was inhibited. The temperature within the boundary layer (1000\u2013900 hPa) gradually increased with height during PE2 at 08:00 and 20:00 on 10\u201311 February, showing an inverse temperature strati\ufb01cation. This further enhanced the accumulation of pollutants. The wind \ufb01eld is an important meteorological factor affecting the accumulation or dispersion of atmospheric pollutants [66]. Figures 6 and 7 show the horizontal wind \ufb01eld pro\ufb01les and vertical wind \ufb01eld plots, respectively, during this period of haze pollution. Positive values in the vertical wind \ufb01eld plots indicate a sinking air\ufb02ow and negative values indicate a rising air\ufb02ow. During PE1, Beijing was in the southeast of the low- pressure system from 12:00 to 18:00 and the near-surface winds were mainly southerly. Pollutants were continuously transported from southern Beijing to downtown Beijing, which accelerated the accumulation of pollutants [50]. With the eastward movement of the low-pressure system, the near-surface wind speed weakened and the lifting air\ufb02ow gradually strengthened. During PE2, the Beijing area was located on the eastern side of the high-pressure region and the near-surface winds were mainly northerly.
