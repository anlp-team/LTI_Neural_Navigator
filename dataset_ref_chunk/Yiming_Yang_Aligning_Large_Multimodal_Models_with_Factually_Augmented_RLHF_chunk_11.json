We follow Dubois et al. (2023) on the implementation of the PPO algorithm, which is a variant of (Ouyang et al., 2022)3. Specifically, we normalize the advantage across the entire batch of rollouts obtained for each PPO step and initialize the value model from the reward model. We used a batch size of 512 for each PPO step. This comprised two epochs of gradient steps, each having 256 rollouts. We applied a peak learning rate of 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 with cosine decay. We clipped the gradient by its Euclidean norm at a limit of 1. Our training spanned 4 complete rounds on our held- out RL data, equaling around 500 PPO steps. For generalized advantage estimation (GAE; Schulman et al. (2015)), both \u03bb and \u03b3 were set at 1. We opted for a constant KL regularizer coefficient of 0.1. For symbolic rewards, the length penalty is set as the number of response tokens divided by the maximum response length (set to 896) times the length penalty coefficient. We set the length penalty coefficient to \u221210.0 for general questions, \u221240.0 for detailed description questions in LLaVA data, and 2.5 for complex reasoning questions in LLaVA data. The correctness penalty is set to 0 for incorrect responses (or irrelevant responses), and to 2 for correct responses. A penalty of \u22128.0 is also applied to incomplete responses.

We follow Dubois et al. (2023) on the implementation of the PPO algorithm, which is a variant of (Ouyang et al., 2022)3. Specifically, we normalize the advantage across the entire batch of rollouts obtained for each PPO step and initialize the value model from the reward model. We used a batch size of 512 for each PPO step. This comprised two epochs of gradient steps, each having 256 rollouts. We applied a peak learning rate of 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 with cosine decay. We clipped the gradient by its Euclidean norm at a limit of 1. Our training spanned 4 complete rounds on our held- out RL data, equaling around 500 PPO steps. For generalized advantage estimation (GAE; Schulman et al. (2015)), both \u03bb and \u03b3 were set at 1. We opted for a constant KL regularizer coefficient of 0.1. For symbolic rewards, the length penalty is set as the number of response tokens divided by the maximum response length (set to 896) times the length penalty coefficient. We set the length penalty coefficient to \u221210.0 for general questions, \u221240.0 for detailed description questions in LLaVA data, and 2.5 for complex reasoning questions in LLaVA data. The correctness penalty is set to 0 for incorrect responses (or irrelevant responses), and to 2 for correct responses. A penalty of \u22128.0 is also applied to incomplete responses.

Question: Is the jam on the bread made of strawberry? Ground Truth: In fact, this photo only shows a cut and toasted bread slice. There is no jam on it. LLaVA: Yes, the jam on the bread is made of strawberry. Table 12: An example question where LLaVA hallucinates a non-existent object. 21 Preprint Question: Which electronic device is larger? Ground Truth: The iPod touch on the left is larger than the iPod nano on the right. LLaVA: The iPod is larger than the cell phone. Table 13: An example question where LLaVA hallucinates the comparison between multiple objects. Question: How many oysters can you see in the photo? Ground Truth: There are five oysters visible in the photo. LLaVA: There are three oysters visible in the photo. Table 14: An example question where LLaVA hallucinates the number of objects. Question: How is the yellow boat positioned in relation to the white yacht in the image? Ground Truth: The yellow boat is positioned in front of the white yacht in the image. LLaVA: The yellow boat is positioned behind the white yacht in the image, traveling in the same direction. Table 15: An example question where LLaVA hallucinates the spatial relation between objects. Question: Is this photo taken indoors or outdoors? Ground Truth: The photo is taken indoors, since there is a group of hockey players playing in an ice stadium. LLaVA: The photo is taken outdoors, as it features a group of hockey players on a frozen lake. Table 16: An example question where LLaVA hallucinates the environment of the image. 22 Preprint Question: Describe the image in detail. Ground Truth: In this image, I see a book, a pen, and a television on a table. The TV screen shows a man speaking in a park. LLaVA: The image shows a man sitting in front of a television, watching a video. The man is wearing a suit and has a mustache, giving him a distinguished appearance. The television screen displays a video, which is likely a news report or a documentary. Table 17: An example question where LLaVA hallucinates during giving a holistic description. Question: What is the name of the book? Ground Truth: The name of the book is \u201cProverbial Philosophy.\u201d LLaVA: The name of the book is \u201cThe Over-Soul.\u201d Table 18: An example question where LLaVA hallucinates the text in the image. 23 Preprint F DETAILS ON IMPLEMENTATIONS AND HYPERPARAMETERS For LoRA-based fine-tuning during the RLHF stage, we use a low-rank r = 64 for both attention modules and feed-forward network modules. We follow Dubois et al. (2023) on the implementation of the PPO algorithm, which is a variant of (Ouyang et al., 2022)3. Specifically, we normalize the advantage across the entire batch of rollouts obtained for each PPO step and initialize the value model from the reward model. We used a batch size of 512 for each PPO step. This comprised two epochs of gradient steps, each having 256 rollouts. We applied a peak learning rate of 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 with cosine decay. We clipped the gradient by its Euclidean norm at a limit of 1. Our training spanned 4 complete rounds on our held- out RL data, equaling around 500 PPO steps. For generalized advantage estimation (GAE; Schulman et al. (2015)), both \u03bb and \u03b3 were set at 1. We opted for a constant KL regularizer coefficient of 0.1. For symbolic rewards, the length penalty is set as the number of response tokens divided by the maximum response length (set to 896) times the length penalty coefficient. We set the length penalty coefficient to \u221210.0 for general questions, \u221240.0 for detailed description questions in LLaVA data, and 2.5 for complex reasoning questions in LLaVA data. The correctness penalty is set to 0 for incorrect responses (or irrelevant responses), and to 2 for correct responses. A penalty of \u22128.0 is also applied to incomplete responses. G GPT-4 EXAMPLERS AND PROMPT FOR MMHAL-BENCH We leverage GPT-4 OpenAI (2023) to evaluate the model responses to the image-question pairs in MMHAL-BENCH. To this end, we first explain the concept of \u201challucination\u201d in the context of LMM and list several examples, and request GPT-4 to analyze and rate the response by LMMs. Finally, we instantiate the query by providing the image contents (extracted from OpenImages an- notations), question, standard human-generated answer, and the LMM response to evaluate. We use the following template prompt as the input to GPT-4, and extract its output to quantify the quality of each response. Please act as an impartial and objective judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) to the user question. Your evaluation should be mainly based on whether the response is informative, and whether the response contains any hallucination. Hallucination, in this context, refers to"}
