You have joined a Ph.D. program that focuses on excellence, creativity, and training the next generation of research leaders. While the next few years will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI will also be rewarding professionally and personally.\nObtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work-life balance helps to keep it in perspective. Carnegie Mellon is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor heritage. In the past, it was the heart of the U.S. steel industry, a source for quality packaged foods, an important financial hub, and an early pioneer in railroads, radio, and nuclear power. This is a city where people worked hard and made things that changed the world. Today, Pittsburgh has reinvented itself as a leader in Computer Science and medicine, but it is still a place where people work hard and make things that change the world. It is also an informal city, where people don\u2019t take themselves too seriously and remember to have fun. It is home to excellent museums, competitive professional sports teams, inexpensive magic shows, and free music during the summer, with skiing and magnificent state parks nearby. Your stay here will be more rewarding if you make time for exploring the many activities that Pittsburgh and Southwest Pennsylvania have to offer.\nThere are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to standard information. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies. All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies. For information about Carnegie Mellon requirements and policies, please see the university\u2019s handbook The Word, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs web page, the Office of the Dean of Students web page, and other resources contained in Appendix A of this handbook.\nWelcome! We hope that your time here is a life-changing experience.\n1.1 Degrees Offered\nThe Language Technologies Institute offers two Ph.D. programs and four Master degrees.\nPh.D. in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D.) \u2022 Dual-Degree Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (CMU-PT Ph.D.) \u2022 Masters in Language Technologies (MLT) \u2022 Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) \u2022 Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) \u2022 Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII)\nLTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 9\n\n\nThis handbook applies to the LTI Ph.D.\nThe Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D.) is focused on understanding and extending the state of the art in computational linguistics, natural language processing, information retrieval, machine translation, speech processing, video dialogue systems, understanding, multimodal systems, automated reasoning, and other topics related to analysis and understanding of unstructured information (e.g., machine learning, and software engineering of intelligent systems).\n1.2 Department Personnel\nThe people responsible for administering the LTI Ph.D. degree are:\nJamie Callan Ph.D. Program Director Professor GHC 5419 callan@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-4525\nStacey Young Ph.D. Academic Program Manager LTI Graduate Program Manager GHC 6415 staceyy@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-2623\nMona Diab LTI Director Professor GHC 5723 mdiab@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-3669\nJoan Axelson Office Manager GHC 5405 jaxelson@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-7517\nJulie Nys Employment Processes Manger GHC 5405 jnys@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-3515\n1.3 University Policies and Expectations\nIt is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines.

Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.\nAs members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.\nThe discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.\nThe commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.\nThe Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found here: https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/.\n2 The Language Technologies Institute\n2.1 Pittsburgh Campus Location\nThe Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5th and 6th floors of the Gates Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Pittsburgh campus.
