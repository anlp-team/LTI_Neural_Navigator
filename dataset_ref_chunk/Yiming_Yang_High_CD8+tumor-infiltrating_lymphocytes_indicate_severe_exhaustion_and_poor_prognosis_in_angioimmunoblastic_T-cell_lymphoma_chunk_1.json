However, the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL and its in\ufb02uence on prognosis. Methods: The correlation between CD8+TILs and IC expression in AITL was analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (n = 2), \ufb02ow cytometry (n = 20), and RNA sequencing (n = 20). Biological changes related to CD8+TILs exhaustion at different cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) levels (mean expression levels of CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1) in AITL were evaluated using RNA sequencing (n = 20) and further validated using the GEO dataset (n = 51). The impact of CD8 protein expression and CTL levels on patient prognosis was analyzed using \ufb02ow cytometry and RNA sequencing, respectively. Results: Our \ufb01ndings demonstrated that the higher the in\ufb01ltration of CD8+TILs, the higher was the proportion of exhausted CD8+TILs characterized by the overexpression of multiple IC. This was accompanied by extensive exhaustion- related biological changes, which suggested severe exhaustion in CD8+TILs and may be one of the main reasons for the poor prognosis of patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL. Conclusion: Our study comprehensively reveals the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs and their potential negative impact on AITL prognosis, which facilitates further mechanistic studies and is valuable for guiding immunotherapy strategies.

AITL originates from T-follicular helper cells and mainly occurs in elderly patients with a heterogeneous prognosis. Most clinical manifestations of AITL, including polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, circulating immune complexes, and cold agglutinin with hemolytic anemia, represent an impaired immune system (2). The AITL microenvironment is rich in multiple cell in\ufb01ltrates, including tumor-in\ufb01ltrating lymphocytes (TILs), macrophages, eosinophils, and mast cells, of which TILs account for a large proportion and play a critical role in AITL. We evaluated the relationship between TILs and AITL prognosis using \ufb02ow cytometry in our previous study, which was the largest cohort focusing on TILs in de novo AITL using fresh lymph node samples (3). Our results suggested that an increase in CD8+TILs, characterized by anti-tumor immunity impairment, was related to an inferior prognosis (3, 4). Notably, the impact of CD8+TILs on AITL was contrary to the results for most other tumors (5, 6); we thus hypothesized that CD8+TILs in AITL may be dysfunctional or exhausted. CD8+TILs play a central role in exerting effector functions, while CD8 +TILs exhaustion, characterized by upregulated expression of immune checkpoints leads to a serious de\ufb01ciency in anti-tumor responses. (IC), Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the correlations among CD8+TILs and expression of IC, exhaustion-related biological changes, and prognosis of patients with AITL, to elucidate the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL and to further explore its in\ufb02uence on AITL occurrence and development as well as to determine possible therapeutic targets. 2 Patients and methods 2.1 Patients De novo AITL cases were identi\ufb01ed from January 2015 to September 2021 at the Department of Pathology of West China Hospital, Sichuan University.

However, the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL and its in\ufb02uence on prognosis. Methods: The correlation between CD8+TILs and IC expression in AITL was analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (n = 2), \ufb02ow cytometry (n = 20), and RNA sequencing (n = 20). Biological changes related to CD8+TILs exhaustion at different cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) levels (mean expression levels of CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1) in AITL were evaluated using RNA sequencing (n = 20) and further validated using the GEO dataset (n = 51). The impact of CD8 protein expression and CTL levels on patient prognosis was analyzed using \ufb02ow cytometry and RNA sequencing, respectively. Results: Our \ufb01ndings demonstrated that the higher the in\ufb01ltration of CD8+TILs, the higher was the proportion of exhausted CD8+TILs characterized by the overexpression of multiple IC. This was accompanied by extensive exhaustion- related biological changes, which suggested severe exhaustion in CD8+TILs and may be one of the main reasons for the poor prognosis of patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL. Conclusion: Our study comprehensively reveals the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs and their potential negative impact on AITL prognosis, which facilitates further mechanistic studies and is valuable for guiding immunotherapy strategies.

AITL originates from T-follicular helper cells and mainly occurs in elderly patients with a heterogeneous prognosis. Most clinical manifestations of AITL, including polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, circulating immune complexes, and cold agglutinin with hemolytic anemia, represent an impaired immune system (2). The AITL microenvironment is rich in multiple cell in\ufb01ltrates, including tumor-in\ufb01ltrating lymphocytes (TILs), macrophages, eosinophils, and mast cells, of which TILs account for a large proportion and play a critical role in AITL. We evaluated the relationship between TILs and AITL prognosis using \ufb02ow cytometry in our previous study, which was the largest cohort focusing on TILs in de novo AITL using fresh lymph node samples (3). Our results suggested that an increase in CD8+TILs, characterized by anti-tumor immunity impairment, was related to an inferior prognosis (3, 4). Notably, the impact of CD8+TILs on AITL was contrary to the results for most other tumors (5, 6); we thus hypothesized that CD8+TILs in AITL may be dysfunctional or exhausted. CD8+TILs play a central role in exerting effector functions, while CD8 +TILs exhaustion, characterized by upregulated expression of immune checkpoints leads to a serious de\ufb01ciency in anti-tumor responses. (IC), Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the correlations among CD8+TILs and expression of IC, exhaustion-related biological changes, and prognosis of patients with AITL, to elucidate the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL and to further explore its in\ufb02uence on AITL occurrence and development as well as to determine possible therapeutic targets. 2 Patients and methods 2.1 Patients De novo AITL cases were identi\ufb01ed from January 2015 to September 2021 at the Department of Pathology of West China Hospital, Sichuan University.

This was accompanied by extensive exhaustion- related biological changes, which suggested severe exhaustion in CD8+TILs and may be one of the main reasons for the poor prognosis of patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL. Conclusion: Our study comprehensively reveals the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs and their potential negative impact on AITL prognosis, which facilitates further mechanistic studies and is valuable for guiding immunotherapy strategies.

AITL originates from T-follicular helper cells and mainly occurs in elderly patients with a heterogeneous prognosis. Most clinical manifestations of AITL, including polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, circulating immune complexes, and cold agglutinin with hemolytic anemia, represent an impaired immune system (2). The AITL microenvironment is rich in multiple cell in\ufb01ltrates, including tumor-in\ufb01ltrating lymphocytes (TILs), macrophages, eosinophils, and mast cells, of which TILs account for a large proportion and play a critical role in AITL. We evaluated the relationship between TILs and AITL prognosis using \ufb02ow cytometry in our previous study, which was the largest cohort focusing on TILs in de novo AITL using fresh lymph node samples (3). Our results suggested that an increase in CD8+TILs, characterized by anti-tumor immunity impairment, was related to an inferior prognosis (3, 4). Notably, the impact of CD8+TILs on AITL was contrary to the results for most other tumors (5, 6); we thus hypothesized that CD8+TILs in AITL may be dysfunctional or exhausted. CD8+TILs play a central role in exerting effector functions, while CD8 +TILs exhaustion, characterized by upregulated expression of immune checkpoints leads to a serious de\ufb01ciency in anti-tumor responses. (IC), Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the correlations among CD8+TILs and expression of IC, exhaustion-related biological changes, and prognosis of patients with AITL, to elucidate the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL and to further explore its in\ufb02uence on AITL occurrence and development as well as to determine possible therapeutic targets. 2 Patients and methods 2.1 Patients De novo AITL cases were identi\ufb01ed from January 2015 to September 2021 at the Department of Pathology of West China Hospital, Sichuan University.
