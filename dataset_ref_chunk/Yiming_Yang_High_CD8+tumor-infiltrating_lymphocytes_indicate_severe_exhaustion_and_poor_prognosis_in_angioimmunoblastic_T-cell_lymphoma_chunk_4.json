Intriguingly, Pritchett et al. recently suggested the presence of exhausted CD8 +TILs in AITL, characterized by IC overexpression (18) compared with those in healthy controls. However, the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs among patients with AITL and their clinical signi\ufb01cance remain unknown. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs based on the expression of IC and multilevel analysis of exhaustion biology-related genes, as well as their impact on prognosis, to better understand the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL, which is bene\ufb01cial for developing targeted immunotherapy. TABLE 3 The expression of IC on CD8+TILs in AITL.

This could impair anti-tumor function and be the main cause of poor prognosis in patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL levels, which has not been reported so far. IC overexpression is a hallmark of CD8+TILs exhaustion (19). By interacting with the corresponding ligands expressed on tumor cells and/or antigen-presenting cells, IC can activate signaling- related pathways and interfere with the metabolism and mitochondrial function of T lymphocytes. These changes eventually induce T lymphocytes exhaustion and impair effector function, resulting in tumor progression (20). Our scRNA-seq study found that there were two clusters of CD8+TILs from AITL, and the expression of multiple IC genes in one cluster (CD8-2 cells) was markedly increased compared with that in the other cluster (CD8-1 cells). Meanwhile, the proportion of CD8-2 cells was higher in AITL cases with more CD8+TILs, suggesting that the proportions of both CD8+TILs and exhausted CD8+TILs was increased in AITL. Further analysis demonstrated that the proportion of CD8+TILs positively To further explore the relationship between the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs and their possible negative impact on prognosis in AITL, we evaluated the functional status associated with CD8+TILs exhaustion from multiple biological aspects (9, 10) at the gene transcription level to reveal the anti-tumor function of CD8+TILs within the high- and low-CTL groups. Our data as well the data from the study of 51 AITL cases by Iqbal et al. (GSE19069 and GSE58445), the largest sample size of RNA sequencing for AITL to date, revealed that CD8+TILs in the high CTL group were more prone to exhaustion-related biological changes and were involved in regulating exhaustion, the obvious de\ufb01ciency in biological function, and immune suppression of the TME. On the one hand, inhibitory cytokines, cell surface receptors, and abnormal signal transduction-related changes may participate in regulating CD8+TILs exhaustion, such as by inducing the expression of A B C D E FIGURE 3 The expression of CD8+PD-1+, CD8+CTLA-4+, CD8+TIM3+, CD8+LAG3+ and CD8+TIGIT+ in AITL (A\u2013E) detected using FCM (n = 20).

On the other hand, there were obvious de\ufb01ciencies in the biological function of CD8+TILs in the high CTL group, characterized by the dysregulated expression of genes related to metabolism, mitochondria, and effector function in CD8+TILs, suggesting a disturbance in normal metabolic processes (27), mitochondrial dysfunction, and de\ufb01ciency in energetic adaptations (28, 29).

However, the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs among patients with AITL and their clinical signi\ufb01cance remain unknown. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs based on the expression of IC and multilevel analysis of exhaustion biology-related genes, as well as their impact on prognosis, to better understand the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL, which is bene\ufb01cial for developing targeted immunotherapy.

This could impair anti-tumor function and be the main cause of poor prognosis in patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL levels, which has not been reported so far. IC overexpression is a hallmark of CD8+TILs exhaustion (19). By interacting with the corresponding ligands expressed on tumor cells and/or antigen-presenting cells, IC can activate signaling- related pathways and interfere with the metabolism and mitochondrial function of T lymphocytes. These changes eventually induce T lymphocytes exhaustion and impair effector function, resulting in tumor progression (20). Our scRNA-seq study found that there were two clusters of CD8+TILs from AITL, and the expression of multiple IC genes in one cluster (CD8-2 cells) was markedly increased compared with that in the other cluster (CD8-1 cells). Meanwhile, the proportion of CD8-2 cells was higher in AITL cases with more CD8+TILs, suggesting that the proportions of both CD8+TILs and exhausted CD8+TILs was increased in AITL. Further analysis demonstrated that the proportion of CD8+TILs positively To further explore the relationship between the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs and their possible negative impact on prognosis in AITL, we evaluated the functional status associated with CD8+TILs exhaustion from multiple biological aspects (9, 10) at the gene transcription level to reveal the anti-tumor function of CD8+TILs within the high- and low-CTL groups. Our data as well the data from the study of 51 AITL cases by Iqbal et al. (GSE19069 and GSE58445), the largest sample size of RNA sequencing for AITL to date, revealed that CD8+TILs in the high CTL group were more prone to exhaustion-related biological changes and were involved in regulating exhaustion, the obvious de\ufb01ciency in biological function, and immune suppression of the TME. On the one hand, inhibitory cytokines, cell surface receptors, and abnormal signal transduction-related changes may participate in regulating CD8+TILs exhaustion, such as by inducing the expression of A B C D E FIGURE 3 The expression of CD8+PD-1+, CD8+CTLA-4+, CD8+TIM3+, CD8+LAG3+ and CD8+TIGIT+ in AITL (A\u2013E) detected using FCM (n = 20).

IC Mean (range) CD8+TILs/T-TILs 40.57(4.1\u201378.9) CD8+PD-1+/CD8+TILs 14.39(0.19\u201345.53) CD8+CTLA-4+/CD8+TILs 9.09(0.11\u201344.28) CD8+TIM3+/CD8+TILs 2.63(0\u201310.66) CD8+LAG3+/CD8+TILs 3.36(0.22\u201314.93) CD8+TIGIT+/CD8+TILs 13.57(0.24\u201347.88) correlated with the expression as well as types of IC at the protein and transcription levels, indicating that the more CD8+TILs, the more exhausted CD8+TILs were induced by the overexpression of IC (21) in AITL. This could impair anti-tumor function and be the main cause of poor prognosis in patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL levels, which has not been reported so far. IC overexpression is a hallmark of CD8+TILs exhaustion (19). By interacting with the corresponding ligands expressed on tumor cells and/or antigen-presenting cells, IC can activate signaling- related pathways and interfere with the metabolism and mitochondrial function of T lymphocytes. These changes eventually induce T lymphocytes exhaustion and impair effector function, resulting in tumor progression (20). Our scRNA-seq study found that there were two clusters of CD8+TILs from AITL, and the expression of multiple IC genes in one cluster (CD8-2 cells) was markedly increased compared with that in the other cluster (CD8-1 cells). Meanwhile, the proportion of CD8-2 cells was higher in AITL cases with more CD8+TILs, suggesting that the proportions of both CD8+TILs and exhausted CD8+TILs was increased in AITL. Further analysis demonstrated that the proportion of CD8+TILs positively To further explore the relationship between the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs and their possible negative impact on prognosis in AITL, we evaluated the functional status associated with CD8+TILs exhaustion from multiple biological aspects (9, 10) at the gene transcription level to reveal the anti-tumor function of CD8+TILs within the high- and low-CTL groups. Our data as well the data from the study of 51 AITL cases by Iqbal et al. (GSE19069 and GSE58445), the largest sample size of RNA sequencing for AITL to date, revealed that CD8+TILs in the high CTL group were more prone to exhaustion-related biological changes and were involved in regulating exhaustion, the obvious de\ufb01ciency in biological function, and immune suppression of the TME. On the one hand, inhibitory cytokines, cell surface receptors, and abnormal signal transduction-related changes may participate in regulating CD8+TILs exhaustion, such as by inducing the expression of A B C D E FIGURE 3 The expression of CD8+PD-1+, CD8+CTLA-4+, CD8+TIM3+, CD8+LAG3+ and CD8+TIGIT+ in AITL (A\u2013E) detected using FCM (n = 20).

On the other hand, there were obvious de\ufb01ciencies in the biological function of CD8+TILs in the high CTL group, characterized by the dysregulated expression of genes related to metabolism, mitochondria, and effector function in CD8+TILs, suggesting a disturbance in normal metabolic processes (27), mitochondrial dysfunction, and de\ufb01ciency in energetic adaptations (28, 29).
