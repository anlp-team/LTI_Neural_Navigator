The temporal variation in monthly BC column concentration over the ICP re-gion for the calculation of regional means is reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product with good consistencies.

However, anthropogenic BC emission in Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) inventory shows an increasing trend of 2.7% over eastern China for the period 2006\u20132014, which is a complete reversal of the trend of PKU inventory.

As shown in Figure 17, although both GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product can describe the variation in monthly BC column concentration over the NCP region, large discrepancies are found for all months except in June. The correlation coef\ufb01cient of R = 0.46 together with RMSE = 3.88 mg/m2 (in Table 4) is found between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the NCP region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the NCP region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval for all months. The absolute differences are larger than 3.5 mg/m2, and the relative difference is higher than 70%, except in June. It is noted that the absolute minimum difference and minimum relative difference (1.7 mg/m2 and 31.3%, respectively) are recorded simultaneously in June when GRASP/Component retrieval presents well the strongest BC emission associated with the biomass burning of agricultural activities in the NCP region. The signi\ufb01cant differences, to some extent, could be attributed to the emissions inventory assumption employed in models [30,31]. Specif- ically, anthropogenic BC emission in CEDS inventory does not describe the decreasing trend of BC in eastern China from 2006 to 2014 [30]. For instance, several anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the key regions of China have shown decreasing trends since 2006, such as anthropogenic black carbon (BC) emission has a statistically noteworthy trend of \u22121.4% per year in the Peking University (PKU) inventory. However, anthropogenic BC emission in Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) inventory shows an increasing trend of 2.7% over eastern China for the period 2006\u20132014, which is a complete reversal of the trend of PKU inventory. Therefore, the models that employ CEDS inventory cannot suc- cessfully capture the practical descending tendency [30].

Indo\u2013China Peninsula The comparisons of BC column concentration between GRASP/Component BC re-trieval and MERRA-2 BC over the Indo\u2013China Peninsula (ICP) region are represented in Figure 16. The temporal variation in monthly BC column concentration over the ICP re-gion for the calculation of regional means is reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product with good consistencies. Specifically, GRASP/Com-ponent BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product present very high BC column concentra-tion in April and May, whereas low BC column concentration in July. The correlation co-efficient of R = 0.89 together with RMSE = 1.30 mg/m2 (in Table 4) are obtained between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the ICP region. The differ-ences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the ICP region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval throughout the year, with the absolute differences varying from 0.4 mg/m2 to 1.7 mg/m2 and the relative differences varying from 21.0% to 77.4%.

North China Plain Figure 17 presents the comparisons of BC column concentration between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product over the North China Plain (NCP) region. As shown in Figure 17, although both GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product can describe the variation in monthly BC column concentration over the NCP region, large discrepancies are found for all months except in June. The for the calculation of regional means is re\ufb02ected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product with good consistencies. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product present very high BC column concentration in April and May, whereas low BC column concentration in July.

North China Plain Figure 17 presents the comparisons of BC column concentration between GRASP/ Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product over the North China Plain (NCP) region. As shown in Figure 17, although both GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product can describe the variation in monthly BC column concentration over the NCP region, large discrepancies are found for all months except in June. The correlation coef\ufb01cient of R = 0.46 together with RMSE = 3.88 mg/m2 (in Table 4) is found between GRASP/Component BC retrieval and MERRA-2 BC product in the NCP region. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 5. We can see that over the NCP region, the BC column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component BC retrieval for all months. The absolute differences are larger than 3.5 mg/m2, and the relative difference is higher than 70%, except in June. It is noted that the absolute minimum difference and minimum relative difference (1.7 mg/m2 and 31.3%, respectively) are recorded simultaneously in June when GRASP/Component retrieval presents well the strongest BC emission associated with the biomass burning of agricultural activities in the NCP region. The signi\ufb01cant differences, to some extent, could be attributed to the emissions inventory assumption employed in models [30,31]. Specif- ically, anthropogenic BC emission in CEDS inventory does not describe the decreasing trend of BC in eastern China from 2006 to 2014 [30]. For instance, several anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the key regions of China have shown decreasing trends since 2006, such as anthropogenic black carbon (BC) emission has a statistically noteworthy trend of \u22121.4% per year in the Peking University (PKU) inventory. However, anthropogenic BC emission in Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) inventory shows an increasing trend of 2.7% over eastern China for the period 2006\u20132014, which is a complete reversal of the trend of PKU inventory. Therefore, the models that employ CEDS inventory cannot suc- cessfully capture the practical descending tendency [30].
