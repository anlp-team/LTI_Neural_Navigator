Prominent arguments with respect to training and model selec- tion were that the pressure to achieve state-of-the- art performance leads to extensive hyperparameter tuning and that a large variety of models are being trained during research and development (even if just for debugging) without being ever deployed. 4 Equity The (in)equity of the available compute resources across groups (e.g., academia and industry) is an increasingly brought up topic in discussions. While the general gist seems to be that many researchers feel excluded by not having access to substantially large compute power (e.g., thousands of GPUs), it often remains unclear whether this is really the case. One of the main objectives of this survey was therefore to quantify such potential disparities. 4.1 Analysis For \ud835\udc444, 229 participants responded (73.4%) with the number of GPUs they have access to. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the total number of GPUs across our participants (in %). Overall, we observe a high disparity across our participants in terms of access to GPUs. For instance, 62% of the partici- pants had access to less than eight GPUs (Fig. 6a), the number used for training academic BERT (Izsak et al., 2021), and 87.8% of the participants had ac- cess to only 9.7% of the total number of GPUs. 15 participants (6.6%) had access to more than 100 GPUs, up to 3000 GPUs, representing 85.6% of the total GPU count (\u223c11.2k). An outlier analysis shows that 13.1% of the respondents had access to a substantially higher number of GPUs (more than 22 GPUs) than the rest. We further find that 57.4% of our participants were unable to run exper- iments due to the lack of computational resources, and 36.2% had no lack of resources (\ud835\udc445). Finally, Fig. 5 shows that 31.4% of our respondents never or rarely thought that more resources could make their work valuable, while 34.3% of respondents answered sometimes, and 34.3% answered often or always (\ud835\udc446).

As in \u00a73, our analysis shows no sig- nificant differences w.r.t. the seniority, and we find larger disparities by job sector. As we can observe in Fig. 6c, respondents in industry (large) had access to a higher number of GPUs than industry (small) and academia. This is one of the few cases where we have to resort to pairwise testing, as the Kruskal- Wallis test indicates that the Null hypothesis cannot be rejected with \ud835\udc3b 5 = 16.976 > \ud835\udc3b 5 0 = 9.488. While we do not find significant differences in our pairwise comparisons, there are still substantial differences between Ind. (l) and Aca. PI (p-value = 0.0827), as well as Ind. (s) and Ind. (l) (p-value = 0.0850). Even though students reported the low- est number of available GPUs, the differences seem less substantial compared to researchers at small industry (p-value = 0.110). Additionally, we find that large industry has the highest percentage of outliers and the largest in-group disparity. Interest- ingly, researchers from small industry seem to have the least issues when running experiments; a stark contrast considering they are among those who re- ported the fewest GPU resources (\ud835\udc445). Regard- ing \ud835\udc446, researchers from large industry responded slightly less often than other groups that their re- search could be more valuable if they had access to more compute power.

Most surprising might be the general disparity we find across the field, as 87.8% of our partici- pants had access to less than 10% of the total num- ber of GPUs, and 62% had access to less then 8 GPUs. Only a very small faction of researchers (2.2% of our respondents) had access to GPU com- pute (1000 or more) to train models with several hundreds of billion parameters for several days or weeks. Many researchers, hence, could only fine- tune models\u2014which requires far fewer resources than pre-training (Zhou et al., 2021)\u2014which is only possible when pre-trained model weights are avail- able.

As in \u00a73, our analysis shows no sig- nificant differences w.r.t. the seniority, and we find larger disparities by job sector. As we can observe in Fig. 6c, respondents in industry (large) had access to a higher number of GPUs than industry (small) and academia. This is one of the few cases where we have to resort to pairwise testing, as the Kruskal- Wallis test indicates that the Null hypothesis cannot be rejected with \ud835\udc3b 5 = 16.976 > \ud835\udc3b 5 0 = 9.488. While we do not find significant differences in our pairwise comparisons, there are still substantial differences between Ind. (l) and Aca. PI (p-value = 0.0827), as well as Ind. (s) and Ind. (l) (p-value = 0.0850). Even though students reported the low- est number of available GPUs, the differences seem less substantial compared to researchers at small industry (p-value = 0.110). Additionally, we find that large industry has the highest percentage of outliers and the largest in-group disparity. Interest- ingly, researchers from small industry seem to have the least issues when running experiments; a stark contrast considering they are among those who re- ported the fewest GPU resources (\ud835\udc445). Regard- ing \ud835\udc446, researchers from large industry responded slightly less often than other groups that their re- search could be more valuable if they had access to more compute power.

Most surprising might be the general disparity we find across the field, as 87.8% of our partici- pants had access to less than 10% of the total num- ber of GPUs, and 62% had access to less then 8 GPUs. Only a very small faction of researchers (2.2% of our respondents) had access to GPU com- pute (1000 or more) to train models with several hundreds of billion parameters for several days or weeks. Many researchers, hence, could only fine- tune models\u2014which requires far fewer resources than pre-training (Zhou et al., 2021)\u2014which is only possible when pre-trained model weights are avail- able. Unfortunately, many recent models are being kept private, which has intensified the discussion about equity in the field (Togelius and Yannakakis, 2023). 5 Impact on"}, {"question": " What percentage of respondents were unable to run experiments due to the lack of computational resources?,answer: 57.4% of the participants were unable to run experiments due to the lack of computational resources.", "ref_chunk": "argued that there exist various methods for efficient inference (see, e.g., Treviso et al., 2023). Prominent arguments with respect to training and model selec- tion were that the pressure to achieve state-of-the- art performance leads to extensive hyperparameter tuning and that a large variety of models are being trained during research and development (even if just for debugging) without being ever deployed. 4 Equity The (in)equity of the available compute resources across groups (e.g., academia and industry) is an increasingly brought up topic in discussions. While the general gist seems to be that many researchers feel excluded by not having access to substantially large compute power (e.g., thousands of GPUs), it often remains unclear whether this is really the case. One of the main objectives of this survey was therefore to quantify such potential disparities. 4.1 Analysis For \ud835\udc444, 229 participants responded (73.4%) with the number of GPUs they have access to. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the total number of GPUs across our participants (in %). Overall, we observe a high disparity across our participants in terms of access to GPUs. For instance, 62% of the partici- pants had access to less than eight GPUs (Fig. 6a), the number used for training academic BERT (Izsak et al., 2021), and 87.8% of the participants had ac- cess to only 9.7% of the total number of GPUs. 15 participants (6.6%) had access to more than 100 GPUs, up to 3000 GPUs, representing 85.6% of the total GPU count (\u223c11.2k). An outlier analysis shows that 13.1% of the respondents had access to a substantially higher number of GPUs (more than 22 GPUs) than the rest. We further find that 57.4% of our participants were unable to run exper- iments due to the lack of computational resources, and 36.2% had no lack of resources (\ud835\udc445). Finally, Fig. 5 shows that 31.4% of our respondents never or rarely thought that more resources could make their work valuable, while 34.3% of respondents answered sometimes, and 34.3% answered often or always (\ud835\udc446).

Most surprising might be the general disparity we find across the field, as 87.8% of our partici- pants had access to less than 10% of the total num- ber of GPUs, and 62% had access to less then 8 GPUs. Only a very small faction of researchers (2.2% of our respondents) had access to GPU com- pute (1000 or more) to train models with several hundreds of billion parameters for several days or weeks. Many researchers, hence, could only fine- tune models\u2014which requires far fewer resources than pre-training (Zhou et al., 2021)\u2014which is only possible when pre-trained model weights are avail- able. Unfortunately, many recent models are being kept private, which has intensified the discussion about equity in the field (Togelius and Yannakakis, 2023). 5 Impact on"}, {"question": " Why has the discussion about equity in the field intensified according to the text?,answer: Many recent models are being kept private, intensifying the discussion about equity in the field.", "ref_chunk": "argued that there exist various methods for efficient inference (see, e.g., Treviso et al., 2023). Prominent arguments with respect to training and model selec- tion were that the pressure to achieve state-of-the- art performance leads to extensive hyperparameter tuning and that a large variety of models are being trained during research and development (even if just for debugging) without being ever deployed. 4 Equity The (in)equity of the available compute resources across groups (e.g., academia and industry) is an increasingly brought up topic in discussions. While the general gist seems to be that many researchers feel excluded by not having access to substantially large compute power (e.g., thousands of GPUs), it often remains unclear whether this is really the case. One of the main objectives of this survey was therefore to quantify such potential disparities. 4.1 Analysis For \ud835\udc444, 229 participants responded (73.4%) with the number of GPUs they have access to. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the total number of GPUs across our participants (in %). Overall, we observe a high disparity across our participants in terms of access to GPUs. For instance, 62% of the partici- pants had access to less than eight GPUs (Fig. 6a), the number used for training academic BERT (Izsak et al., 2021), and 87.8% of the participants had ac- cess to only 9.7% of the total number of GPUs. 15 participants (6.6%) had access to more than 100 GPUs, up to 3000 GPUs, representing 85.6% of the total GPU count (\u223c11.2k). An outlier analysis shows that 13.1% of the respondents had access to a substantially higher number of GPUs (more than 22 GPUs) than the rest. We further find that 57.4% of our participants were unable to run exper- iments due to the lack of computational resources, and 36.2% had no lack of resources (\ud835\udc445). Finally, Fig. 5 shows that 31.4% of our respondents never or rarely thought that more resources could make their work valuable, while 34.3% of respondents answered sometimes, and 34.3% answered often or always (\ud835\udc446).

As in \u00a73, our analysis shows no sig- nificant differences w.r.t. the seniority, and we find larger disparities by job sector. As we can observe in Fig. 6c, respondents in industry (large) had access to a higher number of GPUs than industry (small) and academia. This is one of the few cases where we have to resort to pairwise testing, as the Kruskal- Wallis test indicates that the Null hypothesis cannot be rejected with \ud835\udc3b 5 = 16.976 > \ud835\udc3b 5 0 = 9.488. While we do not find significant differences in our pairwise comparisons, there are still substantial differences between Ind. (l) and Aca. PI (p-value = 0.0827), as well as Ind. (s) and Ind. (l) (p-value = 0.0850). Even though students reported the low- est number of available GPUs, the differences seem less substantial compared to researchers at small industry (p-value = 0.110). Additionally, we find that large industry has the highest percentage of outliers and the largest in-group disparity. Interest- ingly, researchers from small industry seem to have the least issues when running experiments; a stark contrast considering they are among those who re- ported the fewest GPU resources (\ud835\udc445).
