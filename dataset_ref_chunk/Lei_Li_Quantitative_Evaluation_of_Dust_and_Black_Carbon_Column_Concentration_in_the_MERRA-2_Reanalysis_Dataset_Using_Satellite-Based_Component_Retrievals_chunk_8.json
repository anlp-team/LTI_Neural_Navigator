For instance, during boreal winter, relatively high dust concentrations are observed over the Gulf of Guinea and across the northern regions (from Ghana to Cameroon) that are transported by the Harmattan from Saharan dust [52,58]. Therefore, we also selected the Sub-Sahel (SUS) region as a region of interest for the comparisons (Figure 9). As shown in Figure 9, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentration over the SUS region. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in February, March, and April, whereas low values in August. A good corre-lation coefficient (R = 0.89) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the SUS region with RMSE = 159.08 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentra-tions for all months in Figure 9. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the SUS region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in March (330.3 mg/m2) and the rel-ative difference in January (45.0%).

Therefore, we investigate the differences in dust column concentration over the Eastern Tropical Atlantic (ETA) region for these two products. Similar variations in monthly means for the calculation of regional values are re\ufb02ected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product (Figure 8), with high values in June and July, whereas low values are in November and December.

A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.92) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the ETA region with RMSE = 86.79 mg/m2 (in Table 2).

Dust particles originating from North Africa are also observed over the Caribbean Sea [42,55]. Therefore, we investigate the differences in dust column concentration over the Eastern Tropical Atlantic (ETA) region for these two products. Similar variations in monthly means for the calculation of regional values are re\ufb02ected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product (Figure 8), with high values in June and July, whereas low values are in November and December. This behavior is consistent regardless of the differences observed, with a maximum absolute difference in July (140.0 mg/m2) and a maximum relative difference in June and July (about 53%); the absolute minimum difference and relative differences are obtained in November (15.3 mg/m2 and 20.5%, respectively) (Table 3). A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.92) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the ETA region with RMSE = 86.79 mg/m2 (in Table 2). The differences could be partly attributed to the estimation of dust source emission intensity and their long-distance transport in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system. Figure 8.

Sub-Sahel The transatlantic transport of dust particles originating from Saharan and North Africa has been investigated by many studies [56,57]. For instance, during boreal winter, relatively high dust concentrations are observed over the Gulf of Guinea and across the northern regions (from Ghana to Cameroon) that are transported by the Harmattan from Saharan dust [52,58]. Therefore, we also selected the Sub-Sahel (SUS) region as a region of interest for the comparisons (Figure 9). As shown in Figure 9, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentration over the SUS region. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in February, March, and April, whereas low values in August. A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.89) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the SUS region with RMSE = 159.08 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 9. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the SUS region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in March (330.3 mg/m2) and the relative difference in January (45.0%). The absolute minimum difference and relative difference were recorded simultaneously in June (116.4 mg/m2, 39.2%, respectively). Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 388 12 of 24 Figure 8.
