Results and Discussion This section presents the comparisons of mineral dust and BC column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals in the global key regions for the period from March 2005 to October 2013. It provides a fundamental evaluation of the quality of aerosol component reanalysis \ufb01elds using the satellite-measured aerosol component concentration to examine the magnitude of mineral dust and BC column concentration because measured aerosol component concentration data were not assimilated in the MERRA-2 reanalysis. 3.1. Dust Column Concentration There are many natural dust emission sources globally, such as the Sahara region [8,44], the Middle East, Arabian Peninsula [8,9], Taklamakan desert in northwestern China, and Gobi desert across northern China\u2013southern Mongolia [9], etc., making dust particles have major contributions to aerosol mass loading. The prevailing winds can take the dust particles to long-distance areas up to thousands of kilometers from emission sources. For instance, the Atlantic Ocean is under the in\ufb02uence of dust particles emitted from the Sahara region in North Africa [45\u201347]. Dust aerosols also can be transported from the Sahara Desert in North Africa toward the Mediterranean and Europe [48,49]. Therefore, some key regions of dust deserts and downwind dust-dominated regions globally (shown in Figure 1) are selected to investigate the differences in mineral dust column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals. 3.1.1. Sahara Desert The Sahara (SAH) desert region is of great interest in the comparison of satellite- measured and MERRA-2 dust column concentrations with the most active and extensive natural dust sources. According to Figure 3, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentra- tion over the SAH region. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in May, June, and July, whereas low values in November, December, and January. A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.91) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the SAH region with RMSE = 237.67 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust con- centrations for all months in Figure 3. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column con- centration in the SAH region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval with the maximum absolute difference in June (305.9 mg/m2) and the maximum relative difference in November (62.8%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in January (116.4 mg/m2), and the minimum relative difference is obtained in August (39.2%). The differences could be associated with the estimation of some meteorological parameters (such as precipitation [50] and wind speed [4]) in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system that makes signi\ufb01cant contributions to the magnitude of dust column concentration.

Results and Discussion This section presents the comparisons of mineral dust and BC column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals in the global key regions for the period from March 2005 to October 2013. It provides a fundamental evaluation of the quality of aerosol component reanalysis \ufb01elds using the satellite-measured aerosol component concentration to examine the magnitude of mineral dust and BC column concentration because measured aerosol component concentration data were not assimilated in the MERRA-2 reanalysis. 3.1. Dust Column Concentration There are many natural dust emission sources globally, such as the Sahara region [8,44], the Middle East, Arabian Peninsula [8,9], Taklamakan desert in northwestern China, and Gobi desert across northern China\u2013southern Mongolia [9], etc., making dust particles have major contributions to aerosol mass loading. The prevailing winds can take the dust particles to long-distance areas up to thousands of kilometers from emission sources. For instance, the Atlantic Ocean is under the in\ufb02uence of dust particles emitted from the Sahara region in North Africa [45\u201347]. Dust aerosols also can be transported from the Sahara Desert in North Africa toward the Mediterranean and Europe [48,49]. Therefore, some key regions of dust deserts and downwind dust-dominated regions globally (shown in Figure 1) are selected to investigate the differences in mineral dust column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals. 3.1.1. Sahara Desert The Sahara (SAH) desert region is of great interest in the comparison of satellite- measured and MERRA-2 dust column concentrations with the most active and extensive natural dust sources. According to Figure 3, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentra- tion over the SAH region. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in May, June, and July, whereas low values in November, December, and January. A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.91) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the SAH region with RMSE = 237.67 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust con- centrations for all months in Figure 3. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column con- centration in the SAH region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval with the maximum absolute difference in June (305.9 mg/m2) and the maximum relative difference in November (62.8%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in January (116.4 mg/m2), and the minimum relative difference is obtained in August (39.2%). The differences could be associated with the estimation of some meteorological parameters (such as precipitation [50] and wind speed [4]) in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system that makes signi\ufb01cant contributions to the magnitude of dust column concentration.

Results and Discussion This section presents the comparisons of mineral dust and BC column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals in the global key regions for the period from March 2005 to October 2013. It provides a fundamental evaluation of the quality of aerosol component reanalysis \ufb01elds using the satellite-measured aerosol component concentration to examine the magnitude of mineral dust and BC column concentration because measured aerosol component concentration data were not assimilated in the MERRA-2 reanalysis. 3.1. Dust Column Concentration There are many natural dust emission sources globally, such as the Sahara region [8,44], the Middle East, Arabian Peninsula [8,9], Taklamakan desert in northwestern China, and Gobi desert across northern China\u2013southern Mongolia [9], etc., making dust particles have major contributions to aerosol mass loading. The prevailing winds can take the dust particles to long-distance areas up to thousands of kilometers from emission sources. For instance, the Atlantic Ocean is under the in\ufb02uence of dust particles emitted from the Sahara region in North Africa [45\u201347]. Dust aerosols also can be transported from the Sahara Desert in North Africa toward the Mediterranean and Europe [48,49]. Therefore, some key regions of dust deserts and downwind dust-dominated regions globally (shown in Figure 1) are selected to investigate the differences in mineral dust column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals. 3.1.1. Sahara Desert The Sahara (SAH) desert region is of great interest in the comparison of satellite- measured and MERRA-2 dust column concentrations with the most active and extensive natural dust sources. According to Figure 3, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentra- tion over the SAH region. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in May, June, and July, whereas low values in November, December, and January. A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.91) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the SAH region with RMSE = 237.67 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust con- centrations for all months in Figure 3. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column con- centration in the SAH region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval with the maximum absolute difference in June (305.9 mg/m2) and the maximum relative difference in November (62.8%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in January (116.4 mg/m2), and the minimum relative difference is obtained in August (39.2%). The differences could be associated with the estimation of some meteorological parameters (such as precipitation [50] and wind speed [4]) in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system that makes signi\ufb01cant contributions to the magnitude of dust column concentration.

Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in May, June, and July, whereas low values in November, December, and January. A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.91) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the SAH region with RMSE = 237.67 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust con- centrations for all months in Figure 3. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column con- centration in the SAH region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval with the maximum absolute difference in June (305.9 mg/m2) and the maximum relative difference in November (62.8%).

Results and Discussion This section presents the comparisons of mineral dust and BC column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals in the global key regions for the period from March 2005 to October 2013. It provides a fundamental evaluation of the quality of aerosol component reanalysis \ufb01elds using the satellite-measured aerosol component concentration to examine the magnitude of mineral dust and BC column concentration because measured aerosol component concentration data were not assimilated in the MERRA-2 reanalysis. 3.1. Dust Column Concentration There are many natural dust emission sources globally, such as the Sahara region [8,44], the Middle East, Arabian Peninsula [8,9], Taklamakan desert in northwestern China, and Gobi desert across northern China\u2013southern Mongolia [9], etc., making dust particles have major contributions to aerosol mass loading. The prevailing winds can take the dust particles to long-distance areas up to thousands of kilometers from emission sources. For instance, the Atlantic Ocean is under the in\ufb02uence of dust particles emitted from the Sahara region in North Africa [45\u201347]. Dust aerosols also can be transported from the Sahara Desert in North Africa toward the Mediterranean and Europe [48,49]. Therefore, some key regions of dust deserts and downwind dust-dominated regions globally (shown in Figure 1) are selected to investigate the differences in mineral dust column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals. 3.1.1. Sahara Desert The Sahara (SAH) desert region is of great interest in the comparison of satellite- measured and MERRA-2 dust column concentrations with the most active and extensive natural dust sources. According to Figure 3, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentra- tion over the SAH region. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in May, June, and July, whereas low values in November, December, and January. A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.91) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the SAH region with RMSE = 237.67 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust con- centrations for all months in Figure 3. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column con- centration in the SAH region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval with the maximum absolute difference in June (305.9 mg/m2) and the maximum relative difference in November (62.8%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in January (116.4 mg/m2), and the minimum relative difference is obtained in August (39.2%). The differences could be associated with the estimation of some meteorological parameters (such as precipitation [50] and wind speed [4]) in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system that makes signi\ufb01cant contributions to the magnitude of dust column concentration.
