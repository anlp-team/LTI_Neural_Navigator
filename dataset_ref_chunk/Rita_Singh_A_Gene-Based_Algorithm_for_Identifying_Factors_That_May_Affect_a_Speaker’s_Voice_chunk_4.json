A voice chain thus establishes a relationship between an in\ufb02uencing factor\u2014a genetic microdeletion syndrome in this case\u2014and a corresponding effect on voice/speech production. We refer to a voice chain that includes a sequence of \u03b1 pathways from the microdeletion region to the FOXP2 gene as a level-\u03b1 voice chain (Figure 1).

The lines connecting genes are only meant for visual clarity. Chains are formed with respect to genes on a chromosome (a microdeletion region in this case, shown shaded in yellow). In this ideogram, Gene-1 and FOXP2 lie on the same pathway, contributing to a level-1 voice chain. In a level-2 chain, FOXP2 and the microdeletion region are on different pathways, but the pathways share a set of genes. Gene 2 and Gene 3 have level-2 voice chains. In order to trace the genetic links between a microdeletion syndrome and voice, we \ufb01rst attempt to identify voice chains of different lengths that link to the genes in the microdeletion region. For this, we must \ufb01nd voice chains that link the FOXP2 gene to the syndrome, and identify the speci\ufb01c genes from the syndrome through which they are linked. We do so using the graph-search algorithm described below. From our perspective, a biological pathway B is represented by the set of genes it involves: B := {g : g is a gene in the speci\ufb01ed pathway}. Two pathways, B1 and B2, are linked if there are genes that are common to both pathways, i.e., B1 \u2229 B2 (cid:54)= \u2205.

The length of the chain |V | is the number of nodes \u03b1 in the chain, not counting the terminal node S. For the purpose of this paper, we will assume S to be the set of genes in a microdeletion region associated with a syndrome. Thus, S = {g : g is a gene in the microdeletion region}. All voice chains of length \u03b1 form the set of level-\u03b1 voice chains, and the chainlink genes that connect S to the level-\u03b1 voice chains form the chainlink set VN\u03b1.

We do so using the graph-search algorithm described below. From our perspective, a biological pathway B is represented by the set of genes it involves: B := {g : g is a gene in the speci\ufb01ed pathway}. Two pathways, B1 and B2, are linked if there are genes that are common to both pathways, i.e., B1 \u2229 B2 (cid:54)= \u2205. Thus, the set of all pathways can be represented as a graph where the nodes are biological pathways, and two nodes are linked only if the corresponding pathways have common genes, as illustrated in Figure 2a. A pathway chain is any non-repeating sequence of pathways B1B2B3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 BN such that Bi \u2229 Bi+1 (cid:54)= \u2205 and Bi i.e., where every pair of adjacent pathways has common genes, and there are no closed loops in the chain. In terms of the graph (see Figure 2a), a pathway chain is any path between any two nodes in the graph. A voice chain V is any chain V = BVB2B3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 BNS where the head node BV (and the head node alone) is a pathway that includes the FOXP2 gene, i.e., FOXP2 \u2208 BV, and the terminal node S is a set of genes with common characterization, as mentioned earlier. The length of the chain |V | is the number of nodes \u03b1 in the chain, not counting the terminal node S. For the purpose of this paper, we will assume S to be the set of genes in a microdeletion region associated with a syndrome. Thus, S = {g : g is a gene in the microdeletion region}. All voice chains of length \u03b1 form the set of level-\u03b1 voice chains, and the chainlink genes that connect S to the level-\u03b1 voice chains form the chainlink set VN\u03b1.

Each node in this graph represents a biological pathway. The genes gi that contribute to each pathway are listed within the node. Nodes are linked to each other through edges that represent the set of shared genes. If two nodes have no gene in common, no edge exists between them. Genes that link pathways (nodes) are explicitly shown on the edges.

Voice chains are now the paths from BV to S (Figure 2c,d). A breadth-\ufb01rst algorithm, described in Algorithm 1, is used to extract the chainlink sets VN\u03b1 for voice chains of multiple levels.

A voice chain thus establishes a relationship between an in\ufb02uencing factor\u2014a genetic microdeletion syndrome in this case\u2014and a corresponding effect on voice/speech production. We refer to a voice chain that includes a sequence of \u03b1 pathways from the microdeletion region to the FOXP2 gene as a level-\u03b1 voice chain (Figure 1). The speci\ufb01c genes on the microdeletion that link it to the voice chain are referred to as \u201cchainlink\u201d genes. We represent the set of chainlink genes that connect a microdeletion to level-\u03b1 voice chains as the chainlink set VN\u03b1. Since we aim to analyze the genetic basis of the effect of microdeletions on voice, these chainlink sets are the focus of our analysis. Note that the subscript N in VN\u03b1 denotes the manner in which overlaps or linkages between biological pathways are de\ufb01ned. This subscript is \ufb01xed for the purpose of this paper, for which the exact manner in which pathway overlaps are de\ufb01ned is described in Figures 1 and 2 below. We however leave the N in place to facilitate future differentiations and variations of the proposed algorithm based on how the pathway intersections (or unions) may be de\ufb01ned. 5 of 33 Entropy 2023, 25, 897 Figure 1. Voice chains of different levels. In this reversed perspective ideogram, a link depicts a pathway, the black dots on it are genes, and the chromosomes that they belong to are shown as rods where relevant. The lines connecting genes are only meant for visual clarity. Chains are formed with respect to genes on a chromosome (a microdeletion region in this case, shown shaded in yellow). In this ideogram, Gene-1 and FOXP2 lie on the same pathway, contributing to a level-1 voice chain. In a level-2 chain, FOXP2 and the microdeletion region are on different pathways, but the pathways share a set of genes. Gene 2 and Gene 3 have level-2 voice chains. In order to trace the genetic links between a microdeletion syndrome and voice, we \ufb01rst attempt to identify voice chains of different lengths that link to the genes in the microdeletion region. For this, we must \ufb01nd voice chains that link the FOXP2 gene to the syndrome, and identify the speci\ufb01c genes from the syndrome through which they are linked. We do so using the graph-search algorithm described below. From our perspective, a biological pathway B is represented by the set of genes it involves: B := {g : g is a gene in the speci\ufb01ed pathway}. Two pathways, B1 and B2, are linked if there are genes that are common to both pathways, i.e., B1 \u2229 B2 (cid:54)= \u2205.

In terms of the graph (see Figure 2a), a pathway chain is any path between any two nodes in the graph.

All voice chains of length \u03b1 form the set of level-\u03b1 voice chains, and the chainlink genes that connect S to the level-\u03b1 voice chains form the chainlink set VN\u03b1.
