The further enhancement in solar PV and wind energy is mainly attributed sharp reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions (Supplementary Fig. 2). Aerosol emissions reduction can improve the solar energy capture (due to larger surface downwelling shortwave and, to a lesser extent, the cooler PV cells) and increase the favourable ramp-up wind speed conditions. Reaching global carbon neutrality by the mid-twenty-first century is a bold goal for climate change mitigation. More than 120 nations, contributing 70% of global CO2 emissions, have pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions by the mid-twenty-first century31,46. Meanwhile, the installation of renewable energy capacity, including solar PV and wind, is accelerating worldwide. It is expected that the global renew- able energy capacity will increase by about 75% in the next five years47. Although the world is moving in the right direction, much needs to be done to reach net zero carbon emissions by the mid-twenty-first cen- tury. A few recommendations can be made based on the analysis here. (1) Coordination of renewable energy capacity building at the interna- tional level is required due to large regional differences in renewable energy quality (Extended Data Fig. 6). (2) Planning of complementary energy sources because the projected power potentials\u2019 response to future climate change are different for different types of renewable energy. For example, solar PV increases but wind energy decreases in western Africa due to deep decarbonization (Figs. 1 and 3). (3) Smart design of energy transmission and storage due to the temporal inter- mittency of renewable energy. Each country should set their own priorities based on underlying climate and climate projection, local resources, expertise and technologies. Some uncertainties are acknowledged here. First, the wind energy and solar PVPOT are estimated on a daily scale due to model output availability. Here, we compare wind energy and solar PVPOT calculated Nature Climate Change | Volume 13 | July 2023 | 693\u2013700 698 based on daily and hourly fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA5) reanalysis during 1995\u20132014. The daily-based wind energy underestimates hourly-based wind energy by 7.4% on global average due to high frequency fluctuation aver- aged out at the daily level (Supplementary Fig. 6). On the contrary, the daily-based solar PVPOT shows a positive bias of 6.3% on global average compared with hourly-based solar PVPOT (Supplementary Fig. 7). By fix- ing two of three hourly variables and varying the third daily variable, we further show that such positive bias of solar PVPOT is mainly dominated by daily surface downwelling shortwave radiation (Supplementary Fig. 8b), with limited contributions from daily temperature and wind speed (Supplementary Fig. 8a,c). Second, the temporal variability within a day is not included, again due to lack of sub-daily model out- put. The solar PVPOT shows a strong intra-daily variability: zero during the night and peaking in the noontime48,49. Compared to solar PVPOT, the wind energy is relatively stable in a day. However, observational studies showed that wind energy tended to be unstable in a day under clear-sky rather than all-sky conditions50. Third, climate feedback due to constructed wind or solar farms is not considered in the model simulations here. Previous studies show that the installed wind turbines and PV panels would modify land surface properties, such as roughness and albedo, resulting in changes in regional climate51\u201353. 10.

Second, the temporal variability within a day is not included, again due to lack of sub-daily model out- put. The solar PVPOT shows a strong intra-daily variability: zero during the night and peaking in the noontime48,49. Compared to solar PVPOT, the wind energy is relatively stable in a day. However, observational studies showed that wind energy tended to be unstable in a day under clear-sky rather than all-sky conditions50. Third, climate feedback due to constructed wind or solar farms is not considered in the model simulations here. Previous studies show that the installed wind turbines and PV panels would modify land surface properties, such as roughness and albedo, resulting in changes in regional climate51\u201353. 10.

The further enhancement in solar PV and wind energy is mainly attributed sharp reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions (Supplementary Fig. 2). Aerosol emissions reduction can improve the solar energy capture (due to larger surface downwelling shortwave and, to a lesser extent, the cooler PV cells) and increase the favourable ramp-up wind speed conditions. Reaching global carbon neutrality by the mid-twenty-first century is a bold goal for climate change mitigation. More than 120 nations, contributing 70% of global CO2 emissions, have pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions by the mid-twenty-first century31,46.

In order to facilitate the transition into a global economy powered by clean energy, international coordination should be strengthened further, due to the spatial, temporal and technological imbalance of renewable energy resources. 17.

The further enhancement in solar PV and wind energy is mainly attributed sharp reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions (Supplementary Fig. 2). Aerosol emissions reduction can improve the solar energy capture (due to larger surface downwelling shortwave and, to a lesser extent, the cooler PV cells) and increase the favourable ramp-up wind speed conditions. Reaching global carbon neutrality by the mid-twenty-first century is a bold goal for climate change mitigation. More than 120 nations, contributing 70% of global CO2 emissions, have pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions by the mid-twenty-first century31,46. Meanwhile, the installation of renewable energy capacity, including solar PV and wind, is accelerating worldwide. It is expected that the global renew- able energy capacity will increase by about 75% in the next five years47. Although the world is moving in the right direction, much needs to be done to reach net zero carbon emissions by the mid-twenty-first cen- tury. A few recommendations can be made based on the analysis here. (1) Coordination of renewable energy capacity building at the interna- tional level is required due to large regional differences in renewable energy quality (Extended Data Fig. 6). (2) Planning of complementary energy sources because the projected power potentials\u2019 response to future climate change are different for different types of renewable energy. For example, solar PV increases but wind energy decreases in western Africa due to deep decarbonization (Figs. 1 and 3). (3) Smart design of energy transmission and storage due to the temporal inter- mittency of renewable energy. Each country should set their own priorities based on underlying climate and climate projection, local resources, expertise and technologies. Some uncertainties are acknowledged here. First, the wind energy and solar PVPOT are estimated on a daily scale due to model output availability. Here, we compare wind energy and solar PVPOT calculated Nature Climate Change | Volume 13 | July 2023 | 693\u2013700 698 based on daily and hourly fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA5) reanalysis during 1995\u20132014. The daily-based wind energy underestimates hourly-based wind energy by 7.4% on global average due to high frequency fluctuation aver- aged out at the daily level (Supplementary Fig. 6). On the contrary, the daily-based solar PVPOT shows a positive bias of 6.3% on global average compared with hourly-based solar PVPOT (Supplementary Fig. 7). By fix- ing two of three hourly variables and varying the third daily variable, we further show that such positive bias of solar PVPOT is mainly dominated by daily surface downwelling shortwave radiation (Supplementary Fig. 8b), with limited contributions from daily temperature and wind speed (Supplementary Fig. 8a,c). Second, the temporal variability within a day is not included, again due to lack of sub-daily model out- put. The solar PVPOT shows a strong intra-daily variability: zero during the night and peaking in the noontime48,49. Compared to solar PVPOT, the wind energy is relatively stable in a day. However, observational studies showed that wind energy tended to be unstable in a day under clear-sky rather than all-sky conditions50. Third, climate feedback due to constructed wind or solar farms is not considered in the model simulations here. Previous studies show that the installed wind turbines and PV panels would modify land surface properties, such as roughness and albedo, resulting in changes in regional climate51\u201353. 10.
