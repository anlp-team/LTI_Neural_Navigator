The cumulative enhancement of PM2.5 concentrations was jointly in\ufb02uenced by local emis-sions, regional transport, and liquid/heterogeneous reactions at di\ufb00erent stages of this persistent pollution episode [49].

The temporal variations in both aerosol number and mass concentration are shown in Figure 1c. The range of aerosol number concentration varied from ~1000 to 17,000 cm\u22123, with an average of 6714 \u00b1 3117 cm\u22123. The PM2.5 mass concentration ranged from 2 \u00b5g m\u22123 to 197 \u00b5g m\u22123, with an average of 34 \u00b1 39 \u00b5g m\u22123. During the most increasing stages of PM2.5 mass concentration, the aerosol number concentration consistently varied with the mass concentration. However, when an intermittent fog event occurred from January 23rd to 24th, the number concentration decreased with the increasing mass concentration. This suggests that the wet scavenging e\ufb00ect of fog droplets substantially reduced aerosol num-ber concentration, but enhanced liquid-phase reactions alternatively resulting in the in-creases in mass concentration. The CCN concentration at low supersaturations (0.1%) was signi\ufb01cantly lower than the two relatively higher supersaturations (0.2% and 0.3%) (Fig-ure 1d), with average concentrations of 1345 \u00b1 1270 cm\u22123, 2752 \u00b1 2114 cm\u22123, and 3267 \u00b1 2325 cm\u22123, respectively. The time series of PM2.5 chemical composition, dry particle number size distribution (PNSD), and D50 are given in Figure 2. The particle chemical composition is closely related to its hygroscopicity and activation characteristics. The hygroscopic properties of aerosols are mainly determined by composition, with inorganics having higher hygroscopicity [9,50] than less water-soluble substances, such as BC [51,52] or primary organics [53].

The CCN concentration at low supersaturations (0.1%) was signi\ufb01cantly lower than the two relatively higher supersaturations (0.2% and 0.3%) (Fig-ure 1d), with average concentrations of 1345 \u00b1 1270 cm\u22123, 2752 \u00b1 2114 cm\u22123, and 3267 \u00b1 2325 cm\u22123, respectively. The time series of PM2.5 chemical composition, dry particle number size distribution (PNSD), and D50 are given in Figure 2. The particle chemical composition is closely related to its hygroscopicity and activation characteristics.

However, when an intermittent fog event occurred from January 23rd to 24th, the number concentration decreased with the increasing mass concentration. This suggests that the wet scavenging effect of fog droplets substantially reduced aerosol number concentration, but enhanced liquid-phase reactions alternatively resulting in the increases in mass concentration. The CCN concentration at low supersaturations (0.1%) was signi\ufb01cantly lower than the two relatively higher supersaturations (0.2% and 0.3%) (Figure 1d), with average concentrations of 1345 \u00b1 1270 cm\u22123, 2752 \u00b1 2114 cm\u22123, and 3267 \u00b1 2325 cm\u22123, respectively. The time series of PM2.5 chemical composition, dry particle number size distribution (PNSD), and D50 are given in Figure 2. The particle chemical composition is closely related to its hygroscopicity and activation characteristics. The hygroscopic properties of aerosols are mainly determined by composition, with inorganics having higher hygroscopicity [9,50] than less water-soluble substances, such as BC [51,52] or primary organics [53]. At a given SS, particles with higher hygroscopicity are corresponding to smaller D50, indicating such particles are more prone to activation and form cloud droplets. During the observation period, organic matter and nitrate were the most important components, with average percentages of 42.4% \u00b1 11.9% and 21.5% \u00b1 12.1%, respectively, followed by ammonium (18.4% \u00b1 5.0%), sulfate (10.3% \u00b1 7.3%), BC (5.0% \u00b1 2.2%),"}], "doc_text": "were generally associated with southerly winds, whereas higher wind speeds (>3 m s\u22121) corresponded to northerly winds.
