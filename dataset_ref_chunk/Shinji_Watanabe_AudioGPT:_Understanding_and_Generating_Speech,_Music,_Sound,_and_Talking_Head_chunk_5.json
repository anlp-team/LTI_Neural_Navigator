Sound Extraction Query: Translate the English speech into Spanish speech Call Speech Separation Mo-del Target Sound Detection Response: The denoised audio is saved on \"audio/34cffogh.wav\". Speech Enhancement Call Sound Ex-tract Model Response: The mixture audio in-cludes two speakers, the separat-ed audios are saved on \"audio/fhb32il.wav\" and \"audio/iugp67w.wav\" Speech Translation Content: it can be found in algeria lebanon portugal and spain Call Speech T-ranslation Mo-del Query: I want to extract the explosive sound from the mixture Speech Separation Query: Can you help me to separate the mixture speech into two speaker speech ? Content: se encuentra en argelia l\u00edbano portugal y espa\u00f1a Response: The keyboard sound happened in this audio from 1.9 to 3.8 seconds and from 5.9 to 9.3 seconds. Call Speech E-nhancement M-odel Query: Please help me to denoise this audio. Response: The generated audio is saved on audio/83jkoo9.wav Figure 5: Qualitative analysis on simple tasks. 11 References Agostinelli, A., Denk, T.
