Finite Element Model A \ufb01nite element model was developed by using the commercial software ANSYS workbench. The specimen size, material parameters, and load of the \ufb01nite element model were consistent with those of the crack propagation test. A tetrahedral mesh and Solid185 el- ements were adopted, and the overall mesh accuracy was set to 1.5 mm. For a more realistic simulation and considering the requirements of time and accuracy, an in\ufb02uence ball with a radius of 6 mm and a mesh precision of 0.4 mm was set at the crack tip for mesh re\ufb01nement, as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 10b shows the crack propagation path, and it can be seen that the experimental value is very close to the simulated value in terms of crack length and angle. Therefore, the developed \ufb01nite element model was deemed reliable for further parameter analysis. Figure 9. Flowchart for developing the FEM. 4.2. Veri\ufb01cation The results of the \ufb01nite element simulation were compared with the corresponding experimental values, as shown in Figure 10. The maximum errors of the intact Q550E and Q235 in terms of a\u2013N curves in Figure 10a were 6.53% and 3.4%, respectively. The maxi-mum errors of Q550E and Q235 with corrosion pitting were 9.17% and 8.94%, respectively. Due to the grid division of the crack tip, the error of the specimens with corrosion pitting is relatively high, but the overall error is small, which can truly re\ufb02ect the crack propaga-tion of CT specimens.

Initial Crack Angle To study the effect of the initial crack angle on the crack propagation, initial cracks at four angles of 0\u25e6, 30\u25e6, 45\u25e6, and 60\u25e6 were prefabricated on the specimens in this study. The initial crack length was 1.5 mm with a 7 kN load level, thickness of 8 mm, and stress ratio of 0.1. As shown in Figure 11, the trends of crack propagation at different angles were the same. The curves are very close to each other when the initial angles are in the range of 0\u25e6\u201345\u25e6, but they change signi\ufb01cantly at 60\u25e6. Thus, there is a critical angle of crack propagation. An encrypted approximation at 45\u25e6\u201360\u25e6 was carried out. It was found that the critical angle was 52.5\u25e6, where the crack growth rate suddenly changed. According to the K\u2013N curve, with an increase in the initial crack propagation angle, the stress intensity factor caused by crack tip fracture decreases, and the reduction range is as high as 59%.

Finite Element Model A \ufb01nite element model was developed by using the commercial software ANSYS workbench. The specimen size, material parameters, and load of the \ufb01nite element model were consistent with those of the crack propagation test. A tetrahedral mesh and Solid185 el- ements were adopted, and the overall mesh accuracy was set to 1.5 mm. For a more realistic simulation and considering the requirements of time and accuracy, an in\ufb02uence ball with a radius of 6 mm and a mesh precision of 0.4 mm was set at the crack tip for mesh re\ufb01nement, as shown in Figure 8. Smart crack growth simulation was adopted in the mesh processing. This process is based on mesh division that simulates the features of fatigue or crack growth morphology in engineering structures, representing separation, deformation, adaptation, and re-division technology. To simulate static or dynamic fatigue crack growth in the solution process, the in\ufb02uence of the crack tip stress singularity on the crack growth rate can be effectively alleviated. Because the grid changes occur at the crack front, the stress state at the crack tip can be well represented in the process of crack propagation, and the high stress intensity factor at the crack tip caused by rough grid division can be avoided.
