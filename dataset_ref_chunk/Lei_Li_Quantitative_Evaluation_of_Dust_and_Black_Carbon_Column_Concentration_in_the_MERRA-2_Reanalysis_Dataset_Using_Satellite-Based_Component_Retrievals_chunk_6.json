Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with extremely high values from March to June. A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.88) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the BOD region with RMSE = 412.36 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is noted that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust con- centrations for all months in Figure 4. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column con- centration in the BOD region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval with the maximum absolute difference in May (479.1 mg/m2) and a maximum rela- tive difference in November (67.7%). The absolute minimum difference of 302.2 mg/m2 was recorded in September, and the minimum relative difference was obtained in April (34.3%). Figure 4.

Taklamakan Desert The comparison of the Taklamakan (TAK) desert in northwestern China is shown in Figure 6. We can see that the same variation in monthly means for the calculation of re-gional values is reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product pre-sent the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in April and May, whereas there are low values in November, December, and January. A correlation coeffi-cient of 0.80 is found between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the TAK region with RMSE = 122.30 mg/m2 (in Table 2). The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that over the TAK region, the dust column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component dust retrieval from May to December and February; however, it is lower for the months of January, March, and April. The maximum absolute differences of 144.7 mg/m2 and 141.7 mg/m2 are obtained in August and September, respectively, and the maximum relative difference is recorded in October (49.2%).

A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.90) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the MIE region with RMSE = 134.43 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is worth mentioning that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 5. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the MIE region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in August (209.7 mg/m2) and the relative difference in November (55.9%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in February (54.0 mg/m2) and the relative difference in May (18.0%). We should point out that the highest dust col- umn concentration in the MIE region was retrieved in 2012 (Figure 5), which is consistent with the \ufb01ndings that the maximum values of AOD observed in 2012 over the MIE region using MODIS products during the period 2000 to 2015 [5]. The meteorological parameters of sea level pressure and wind speed representing the in\ufb02uences of synoptic systems on dust concentration make contributions to aerosol loading in the MIE region. The variation in dust column concentration in the Arabian Peninsula is intensely associated with the Shamal winds, the magnitude of precipitation, the tropical Indian Ocean, and the Mediter- ranean Sea temperatures [51]. The accuracy of meteorological parameters estimation in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system could partly affect the differences. Figure 5. Same as Figure 3, but for Middle East (MIE) region. 3.1.4.

We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the MIE region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in August (209.7 mg/m2) and the relative difference in November (55.9%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in February (54.0 mg/m2) and the relative difference in May (18.0%). We should point out that the highest dust col- umn concentration in the MIE region was retrieved in 2012 (Figure 5), which is consistent with the \ufb01ndings that the maximum values of AOD observed in 2012 over the MIE region using MODIS products during the period 2000 to 2015 [5]. The meteorological parameters of sea level pressure and wind speed representing the in\ufb02uences of synoptic systems on dust concentration make contributions to aerosol loading in the MIE region. The variation in dust column concentration in the Arabian Peninsula is intensely associated with the Shamal winds, the magnitude of precipitation, the tropical Indian Ocean, and the Mediter- ranean Sea temperatures [51].

We can see that the same variation in monthly means for the calculation of re-gional values is reflected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product pre-sent the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in April and May, whereas there are low values in November, December, and January. A correlation coeffi-cient of 0.80 is found between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product in the TAK region with RMSE = 122.30 mg/m2 (in Table 2). The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that over the TAK region, the dust column concentration of MERRA-2 is higher than those of GRASP/Component dust retrieval from May to December and February; however, it is lower for the months of January, March, and April. The maximum absolute differences of 144.7 mg/m2 and 141.7 mg/m2 are obtained in August and September, respectively, and the maximum relative difference is recorded in October (49.2%). The absolute minimum difference was obtained in January (\u22126.8 mg/m2 indicating MERRA-2 dust column con-centration is lower than GRASP/Component dust column concentration), and a minimum relative difference of 3.2% was recorded in February.

The statistics in the comparisons are also investigated for the regional dust column concentration. A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.90) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the MIE region with RMSE = 134.43 mg/m2 (in Table 2). It is worth mentioning that MERRA-2 dust concentrations are higher than GRASP/Component dust concentrations for all months in Figure 5. The differences in regional means between these two products can be found in Table 3. We can see that MERRA-2 overestimates dust column concentration in the MIE region throughout the year compared to GRASP/Component dust retrieval, with the maximum absolute difference in August (209.7 mg/m2) and the relative difference in November (55.9%). The absolute minimum difference is obtained in February (54.0 mg/m2) and the relative difference in May (18.0%). We should point out that the highest dust col- umn concentration in the MIE region was retrieved in 2012 (Figure 5), which is consistent with the \ufb01ndings that the maximum values of AOD observed in 2012 over the MIE region using MODIS products during the period 2000 to 2015 [5]. The meteorological parameters of sea level pressure and wind speed representing the in\ufb02uences of synoptic systems on dust concentration make contributions to aerosol loading in the MIE region. The variation in dust column concentration in the Arabian Peninsula is intensely associated with the Shamal winds, the magnitude of precipitation, the tropical Indian Ocean, and the Mediter- ranean Sea temperatures [51]. The accuracy of meteorological parameters estimation in the MERRA-2 reanalysis system could partly affect the differences. Figure 5. Same as Figure 3, but for Middle East (MIE) region. 3.1.4. Taklamakan Desert The comparison of the Taklamakan (TAK) desert in northwestern China is shown in Figure 6. We can see that the same variation in monthly means for the calculation of regional values is re\ufb02ected by both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product. Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with high values in April and May, whereas there are low values in November, December, and January.

Speci\ufb01cally, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of dust column concentration with extremely high values from March to June. A good correlation coef\ufb01cient (R = 0.88) between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product is obtained in the BOD region with RMSE = 412.36 mg/m2 (in Table 2).

The differences in column dust concentration between GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product over MIE are shown in Figure 5.
