We have analyzed the influence of the vertical distribution of aerosols and their interconnection with the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer during an episode of heavy haze pollution in Beijing from 8 to 15 February 2020. The vertical profile of the aerosol extinction coefficient was different in different seasons and at different altitudes. Below 2 km, the aerosol extinction coefficient was Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 475 17 of 22 The daily mean PM2.5/CO values showed a \ufb02uctuating increasing trend as the pollu- tion developed from 8 to 13 February. The daily mean PM2.5/CO values increased about 1.3 times from the early (68.3 \u00d7 10\u22123) to late (95.0 \u00d7 10\u22123) stages of the pollution event. This indicates that secondary transformation intensi\ufb01ed when the pollution accumulated in the late stage [87]. During PE1, the PM2.5/CO ratio increased from about 40.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 to about 120.0 \u00d7 10\u22123, indicating that secondary transformation was gradually increasing during PE1. CO, NO2 and O3 all increased with the PM2.5/CO ratio, but the SO2 concentration did not change signi\ufb01cantly and the incremental increase in the SSA (Figure 9) on 8\u20139 February was probably due to secondary sulfate.

Conclusions We have studied the vertical distribution of aerosols over Beijing from 2017 to 2021 based on long-term LiDAR observations. We have analyzed the in\ufb02uence of the vertical distribution of aerosols and their interconnection with the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer during an episode of heavy haze pollution in Beijing from 8 to 15 February 2020. The vertical pro\ufb01le of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was different in different seasons and at different altitudes. Below 2 km, the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was highest in summer, lower in winter, and lowest in spring and autumn; the lowest extinction coef\ufb01cients were about 0.4, 0.35 and 0.3 km\u22121, respectively. The maximum height of the boundary layer in Beijing can reach about 2 km in the summer months. Aerosol particles can be transported to an altitude of about 2 km via turbulence and the high relative humidity in summer makes it easier for aerosol particles to absorb moisture and grow, resulting in the high aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient below 2 km in summer. At the upper level of 2\u20133 km, the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was highest (about 0.1 km\u22121) in spring and roughly comparable in summer, autumn and winter (<0.1 km\u22121). This is due to the frequent occurrence of dust pollution events in Beijing in spring and the transport of dust aerosols to an altitude of 2\u20133 km. This leads to a larger aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient that does not change with height. The vertical pro\ufb01le of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient showed a clear daily variation in all four seasons. The development of the boundary layer and the vertical distribution of aerosols were different in different seasons. The height of the high-value zone of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was highest in summer, with a maximum value at about 1.25 km at 13:00. By contrast, the height of the high-value zone of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was lowest in winter, with a maximum of about 0.7 km at 14:00. The maximum height in both spring and autumn was about 0.8 km at 12:00. We have discussed the in\ufb02uence and interconnections of the vertical distribution of aerosols, the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer and the optical properties of aerosols during a haze event in Beijing. During PE2, the updraft promoted the accumula- tion of pollutants between 0.5 and 1.5 km. Together with the hygroscopic growth of aerosol particles, this led to a gradual increase in AOD440nm, but the PM2.5 mass concentration did not change signi\ufb01cantly. A sinking air\ufb02ow of 1\u20131.5 m s\u22121 appeared around 11:00, which transported pollutants from high altitudes to the near-surface, promoting a rapid increase in the PM2.5 mass concentration. Scattered spherical \ufb01ne particles dominated this heavy haze pollution event.

The daily mean PM2.5/CO values increased about 1.3 times from the early (68.3 \u00d7 10\u22123) to late (95.0 \u00d7 10\u22123) stages of the pollution event. This indicates that secondary transformation intensi\ufb01ed when the pollution accumulated in the late stage [87]. During PE1, the PM2.5/CO ratio increased from about 40.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 to about 120.0 \u00d7 10\u22123, indicating that secondary transformation was gradually increasing during PE1.

Conclusions We have studied the vertical distribution of aerosols over Beijing from 2017 to 2021 based on long-term LiDAR observations. We have analyzed the in\ufb02uence of the vertical distribution of aerosols and their interconnection with the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer during an episode of heavy haze pollution in Beijing from 8 to 15 February 2020. The vertical pro\ufb01le of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was different in different seasons and at different altitudes. Below 2 km, the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was highest in summer, lower in winter, and lowest in spring and autumn; the lowest extinction coef\ufb01cients were about 0.4, 0.35 and 0.3 km\u22121, respectively. The maximum height of the boundary layer in Beijing can reach about 2 km in the summer months. Aerosol particles can be transported to an altitude of about 2 km via turbulence and the high relative humidity in summer makes it easier for aerosol particles to absorb moisture and grow, resulting in the high aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient below 2 km in summer. At the upper level of 2\u20133 km, the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was highest (about 0.1 km\u22121) in spring and roughly comparable in summer, autumn and winter (<0.1 km\u22121). This is due to the frequent occurrence of dust pollution events in Beijing in spring and the transport of dust aerosols to an altitude of 2\u20133 km. This leads to a larger aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient that does not change with height. The vertical pro\ufb01le of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient showed a clear daily variation in all four seasons. The development of the boundary layer and the vertical distribution of aerosols were different in different seasons. The height of the high-value zone of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was highest in summer, with a maximum value at about 1.25 km at 13:00. By contrast, the height of the high-value zone of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was lowest in winter, with a maximum of about 0.7 km at 14:00. The maximum height in both spring and autumn was about 0.8 km at 12:00. We have discussed the in\ufb02uence and interconnections of the vertical distribution of aerosols, the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer and the optical properties of aerosols during a haze event in Beijing. During PE2, the updraft promoted the accumula- tion of pollutants between 0.5 and 1.5 km. Together with the hygroscopic growth of aerosol particles, this led to a gradual increase in AOD440nm, but the PM2.5 mass concentration did not change signi\ufb01cantly. A sinking air\ufb02ow of 1\u20131.5 m s\u22121 appeared around 11:00, which transported pollutants from high altitudes to the near-surface, promoting a rapid increase in the PM2.5 mass concentration. Scattered spherical \ufb01ne particles dominated this heavy haze pollution event.

The daily mean PM2.5/CO values increased about 1.3 times from the early (68.3 \u00d7 10\u22123) to late (95.0 \u00d7 10\u22123) stages of the pollution event. This indicates that secondary transformation intensi\ufb01ed when the pollution accumulated in the late stage [87]. During PE1, the PM2.5/CO ratio increased from about 40.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 to about 120.0 \u00d7 10\u22123, indicating that secondary transformation was gradually increasing during PE1. CO, NO2 and O3 all increased with the PM2.5/CO ratio, but the SO2 concentration did not change signi\ufb01cantly and the incremental increase in the SSA (Figure 9) on 8\u20139 February was probably due to secondary sulfate.

The CO and SO2 concentrations showed a clear increase, whereas O3 showed clear daily variations, indicating that the role of secondary conversion gradually decreased.

Conclusions We have studied the vertical distribution of aerosols over Beijing from 2017 to 2021 based on long-term LiDAR observations. We have analyzed the in\ufb02uence of the vertical distribution of aerosols and their interconnection with the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer during an episode of heavy haze pollution in Beijing from 8 to 15 February 2020. The vertical pro\ufb01le of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was different in different seasons and at different altitudes. Below 2 km, the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was highest in summer, lower in winter, and lowest in spring and autumn; the lowest extinction coef\ufb01cients were about 0.4, 0.35 and 0.3 km\u22121, respectively. The maximum height of the boundary layer in Beijing can reach about 2 km in the summer months. Aerosol particles can be transported to an altitude of about 2 km via turbulence and the high relative humidity in summer makes it easier for aerosol particles to absorb moisture and grow, resulting in the high aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient below 2 km in summer. At the upper level of 2\u20133 km, the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was highest (about 0.1 km\u22121) in spring and roughly comparable in summer, autumn and winter (<0.1 km\u22121). This is due to the frequent occurrence of dust pollution events in Beijing in spring and the transport of dust aerosols to an altitude of 2\u20133 km. This leads to a larger aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient that does not change with height. The vertical pro\ufb01le of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient showed a clear daily variation in all four seasons. The development of the boundary layer and the vertical distribution of aerosols were different in different seasons. The height of the high-value zone of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was highest in summer, with a maximum value at about 1.25 km at 13:00. By contrast, the height of the high-value zone of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient was lowest in winter, with a maximum of about 0.7 km at 14:00. The maximum height in both spring and autumn was about 0.8 km at 12:00. We have discussed the in\ufb02uence and interconnections of the vertical distribution of aerosols, the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer and the optical properties of aerosols during a haze event in Beijing. During PE2, the updraft promoted the accumula- tion of pollutants between 0.5 and 1.5 km. Together with the hygroscopic growth of aerosol particles, this led to a gradual increase in AOD440nm, but the PM2.5 mass concentration did not change signi\ufb01cantly. A sinking air\ufb02ow of 1\u20131.5 m s\u22121 appeared around 11:00, which transported pollutants from high altitudes to the near-surface, promoting a rapid increase in the PM2.5 mass concentration. Scattered spherical \ufb01ne particles dominated this heavy haze pollution event.
