Welcome\nWelcome to the Language Technologies Institute. While this handbook (and your college graduate student handbook) is specific to your academic experience in the LTI, there are several other resources and offices that graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, the student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, and others, are included in Appendix A of this handbook.\n1.2 The MLT Degree\nThe Master of Language Technologies (MLT) is a research-oriented Master of Science degree offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MLT program is a 24-month program consisting of courses, directed research, and an optional Masters' Thesis. Typical research areas include speech processing, information retrieval, machine translation, natural language processing, machine learning, and computational biology. Many MLT graduates continue on to PhD programs in the LTI or other leading universities. Other graduates go on to work in the computer industry, many at major corporate research laboratories.\nThere are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to the standard information outlined below. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Master of Language Technologies (MLT) degree.\nWhile this handbook is specific to your academic experience in the department, there are several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook, the Office of the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are included in Appendix A of this handbook.\nAll policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies described in The Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook and at the University Policies website.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 6\n\n\n1.3 MLT Contact Information\nThe people responsible for administering the MLT degree are:\nKate Schaich Program Manager, MLT Graduate Program Manager, LTI GHC 6415 412-268-4788 kschaich@cs.cmu.edu\nRobert Frederking Program Director, MLT Principal Systems Scientist GHC 6515 412-268-6656 ref@cs.cmu.edu\nRobert Frederking Chair of Graduate Programs, LTI Principal Systems Scientist GHC 6515\nMona Diab Director, LTI GHC 5415 412-268-6656 mdiab@andrew.cmu.edu\nIn addition, students may confer with the Graduate Education Office (graded@andrew.cmu.edu) regarding issues of process or other concerns as they navigate conflicts.\nThe Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5th and 6th floors of the Gates Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Pittsburgh campus. The address and contact information of the LTI are:\nLanguage Technologies Institute Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue Gates Hillman Complex 5402, LTI Pittsburgh, PA 15241-3891\n412-268-6591 (phone) 412-268-6298 (fax)\nhttp://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 7\n\n\n1.4 University Policies and Expectations\nIt is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines. In addition to this departmental graduate student handbook, the following resources are available to assist you in understanding community expectations:\nThe Word/Student Handbook: \u2022 Academic Integrity Policy: life/academic-integrity.html\nThe Word/Student Handbook: \u2022 Academic Integrity Policy: life/academic-integrity.html\nUniversity Policies Website: \u2022 Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs:\nwww.cmu.edu/policies/\nwww.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/index.html\nDue to the changing nature of conditions and expectations surrounding public health and safety requirements, please visit www.cmu.edu/coronavirus for the most up to date information.\nPlease see Appendix A for additional information about The Word and other university resources.\n1.5 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance\nCarnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state or local laws or executive orders.\nInquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be directed to the university ombudsman, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, telephone 412-268-1018. Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling 412-268-2000.\nCarnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report describing the university's security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault and fire safety policies, and containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on the campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412-268-2323. The annual security and fire safety report also is available online at www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports.\nInformation regarding the application of Title IX, including to admission and employment decisions, the sexual misconduct grievance procedures and process, including how to file a report or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment, and how\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 8\n\n\nthe university responds to such reports is available at www.cmu.edu/title-ix. The Title IX coordinator may be reached at 5000 Forbes Ave., 140 Cyert Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; 412- 268-7125; or tix@cmu.edu.\n1.6 The Carnegie Mellon Code\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct possible.\nThese standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.\nAs members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.\nThe discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.\nThe commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.\nThe Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at http://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/code.html\n1.7 Vision\nCarnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society through continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship.\nMLT Graduate Student Handbook\nPage 9\n\n\n1.8 Mission\nTo create a transformative educational experience for students focused on deep disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-being.\nTo cultivate a transformative university community dedicated to a) attracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential.\nTo impact society in a transformative way\u2014regionally, nationally, and globally\u2014by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the university campus.\n1.9 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate\nStudents\nThis policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual, or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited.
