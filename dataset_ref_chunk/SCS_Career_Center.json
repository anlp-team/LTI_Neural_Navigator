Dr. Newell, the U.A. and Helen Whitaker professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, engaged in pioneering work in artificial intelligence, the theory of human cognition and the development of computer software and hardware systems for complex information processing. In 1992, he was awarded the National Medal of Science by then President George Bush. Dr. Newell's career spanned the entire computer era, which began in the early 1950s. The fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science grew in part from his idea that computers could process symbols as well as numbers, and if programmed properly would be capable of solving problems in the same way humans do. In cognitive science, he focused on problem solving and the cognitive architecture that supports intelligent action in humans and machines. In computer science, he worked on areas as diverse as list processing, computer description languages, hypertext systems and psychologically based models of human-computer interaction. From the early 1980s, his work centered on the development of Soar , an artificially intelligent software system capable of solving problems and learning in ways similar to human beings. The goal of Soar was to provide an underlying structure that would enable a computer system to perform a range of cognitive tasks.

Dr. Newell, the U.A. and Helen Whitaker professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, engaged in pioneering work in artificial intelligence, the theory of human cognition and the development of computer software and hardware systems for complex information processing. In 1992, he was awarded the National Medal of Science by then President George Bush. Dr. Newell's career spanned the entire computer era, which began in the early 1950s. The fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science grew in part from his idea that computers could process symbols as well as numbers, and if programmed properly would be capable of solving problems in the same way humans do. In cognitive science, he focused on problem solving and the cognitive architecture that supports intelligent action in humans and machines. In computer science, he worked on areas as diverse as list processing, computer description languages, hypertext systems and psychologically based models of human-computer interaction. From the early 1980s, his work centered on the development of Soar , an artificially intelligent software system capable of solving problems and learning in ways similar to human beings. The goal of Soar was to provide an underlying structure that would enable a computer system to perform a range of cognitive tasks. Soar was used as a framework for several intelligent systems at research institutions around the country. A native of San Francisco, Dr. Newell received a bachelor's degree in physics from Stanford University in 1949. He spent a year at Princeton University doing graduate work in mathematics, and worked for the Rand Corporation as a research scientist from 1950-1961. While at Rand, he met Herbert A.
