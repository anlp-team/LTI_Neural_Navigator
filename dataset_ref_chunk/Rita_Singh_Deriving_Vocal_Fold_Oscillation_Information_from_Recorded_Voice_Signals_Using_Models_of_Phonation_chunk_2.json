The balance of forces necessary to cause self-sustained vibrations during phonation is created by physical phenomena such as the Bernoulli effect and the Coand\u02c7a effect [6\u20138]. Figure 1 illustrates the interaction between these effects that is largely thought to drive the oscillations of the vocal folds. The process of phonation begins with the closing of the glottis. This closure is voluntary and facilitated by the laryngeal muscles. Once closed, the muscles do not actively play a role in sustaining the vibrations. Glottal closure is followed by a contraction of the lungs which pushes out air and causes an increase in pressure just below the glottis. When this subglottal pressure crosses a threshold, the vocal folds are pushed apart, and air rushes out of the narrow glottal opening into the much wider supra-glottal region, creating negative intra-glottal pressure (with reference to atmospheric air pressure) [9]. The exact physics of the air\ufb02ow through the glottis during phonation is well studied, e.g., [2,10\u201314]. The current understanding from these, from the air\ufb02ow perspective, is that the glottis forms a \ufb02ow separation plane. The air expansion in this region and the low pressure created in the vicinity of the glottis through the Coand\u02c7a effect-induced entrainment cause a lowering of pressure close to the glottis and a net downward force on the glottis. At the same time, lowered pressure in the glottal region due to the Bernoulli effect that ensues from the high-velocity air volume \ufb02ow through the glottis exerts a negative force on the glottis. The negative Bernoulli pressure causes elastic recoil, causing it to begin to close again. The closing reduces the volume \ufb02ow through the glottis, diminishing the downward forces acting on it. Increased pressure build-up in the sub-glottal region causes the glottis 2 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 to open again. This chain of oscillations continues in a self-sustained fashion throughout phonation until voluntary muscle control intervenes to alter or stop it or as the respiratory volume of air in the lungs is exhausted.

General Approaches to Phonation Modeling Physical models of phonation, e.g., [9,11,15\u201320], attempt to explain this complex physical process using relations derived from actual physics, especially aerodynamics and the physics of mechanical structures. For modeling purposes, we note that phonation is not the only source of excitation of the the vocal tract in producing speechsounds, which comprise both voiced and unvoiced sounds. However, phonation is indeed the primary source of excitation of the vocal tract in the production of voiced sounds, wherein the oscillation of the vocal folds modulates the pressure of the air\ufb02ow to produce a (quasi-) periodic glottal \ufb02ow wave at a fundamental frequency (the pitch), which in turn results in the occurrence of higher order harmonics. The resultant glottal \ufb02ow further excites the vocal tract, which comprises the laryngeal cavity, the pharynx, and the oral and nasal cavities, to produce individual sounds. The vocal tract serves as a resonance chamber that produces formants. The identities of the different sounds produced within it are derived from these resonances, which in turn are largely dependent on the con\ufb01gurations of the vocal tract speci\ufb01ed by their time-varying cross- sectional area. From this perspective, phonation modeling has typically involved the modeling of two sub-processes: the self-sustained vibration of the vocal folds, and the propagation of the resultant pressure wave through the vocal tract [21]. Each sub-process model has associated parameters that determine the model output, given an input. Following the above division of the process, we identify the two following model types, each modeling one of the sub-processes: (i) Vocal fold oscillation (VFO) models (also called vocal folds models, or oscillation models), and (ii) vocal tract (VT) models. The VFO models describe the vibration of vocal folds and their aerodynamic interac- tion with air\ufb02ow. Such models are of four broad types: one-mass models, e.g., [2,16,22\u201324], two-mass models, e.g., [11,15], multi-mass models [18], and \ufb01nite element models, e.g., [17]. 3 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Each of these has proven to be useful in different contexts. The VT models describe the in- teraction of the glottal pressure wave with the vocal tract, which is turn has been described in the literature by varied models, such as statistical models, e.g., [25], geometric models, e.g., [26] and biomechanical models, e.g., [27]. In addition, different models are also applied to describe the aero-acoustic interaction of the glottal air\ufb02ow and the vocal tract. Some examples of these are re\ufb02ection-type line analog models and transmission line circuit analog models, e.g., [28], hybrid time-frequency domain models, e.g., [29] and \ufb01nite-element models, e.g., [30]. 2. The Problem of Parameter Estimation Each of the models mentioned in Section 1.2 includes a set of parameters that determine its state, and output, given an input. For instance, given the parameters for a VFO model, the glottal \ufb02ow waveform can be determined; given the glottal \ufb02ow waveform as an input, and the parameters for a VFO model, the acoustic signal can be determined. The problem we tackle in this paper is the inverse problem: given a model output, we must estimate the model parameters from it. This can be of great practical use. For example, with speaker-speci\ufb01c parameter setting, the output of these models can be used as a proxy for the actual vocal fold motion of the corresponding speaker.

Such models are of four broad types: one-mass models, e.g., [2,16,22\u201324], two-mass models, e.g., [11,15], multi-mass models [18], and \ufb01nite element models, e.g., [17]. 3 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Each of these has proven to be useful in different contexts. The VT models describe the in- teraction of the glottal pressure wave with the vocal tract, which is turn has been described in the literature by varied models, such as statistical models, e.g., [25], geometric models, e.g., [26] and biomechanical models, e.g., [27]. In addition, different models are also applied to describe the aero-acoustic interaction of the glottal air\ufb02ow and the vocal tract. Some examples of these are re\ufb02ection-type line analog models and transmission line circuit analog models, e.g., [28], hybrid time-frequency domain models, e.g., [29] and \ufb01nite-element models, e.g., [30]. 2. The Problem of Parameter Estimation Each of the models mentioned in Section 1.2 includes a set of parameters that determine its state, and output, given an input. For instance, given the parameters for a VFO model, the glottal \ufb02ow waveform can be determined; given the glottal \ufb02ow waveform as an input, and the parameters for a VFO model, the acoustic signal can be determined. The problem we tackle in this paper is the inverse problem: given a model output, we must estimate the model parameters from it. This can be of great practical use. For example, with speaker-speci\ufb01c parameter setting, the output of these models can be used as a proxy for the actual vocal fold motion of the corresponding speaker.

The balance of forces necessary to cause self-sustained vibrations during phonation is created by physical phenomena such as the Bernoulli effect and the Coand\u02c7a effect [6\u20138]. Figure 1 illustrates the interaction between these effects that is largely thought to drive the oscillations of the vocal folds. The process of phonation begins with the closing of the glottis. This closure is voluntary and facilitated by the laryngeal muscles. Once closed, the muscles do not actively play a role in sustaining the vibrations. Glottal closure is followed by a contraction of the lungs which pushes out air and causes an increase in pressure just below the glottis. When this subglottal pressure crosses a threshold, the vocal folds are pushed apart, and air rushes out of the narrow glottal opening into the much wider supra-glottal region, creating negative intra-glottal pressure (with reference to atmospheric air pressure) [9]. The exact physics of the air\ufb02ow through the glottis during phonation is well studied, e.g., [2,10\u201314]. The current understanding from these, from the air\ufb02ow perspective, is that the glottis forms a \ufb02ow separation plane. The air expansion in this region and the low pressure created in the vicinity of the glottis through the Coand\u02c7a effect-induced entrainment cause a lowering of pressure close to the glottis and a net downward force on the glottis. At the same time, lowered pressure in the glottal region due to the Bernoulli effect that ensues from the high-velocity air volume \ufb02ow through the glottis exerts a negative force on the glottis. The negative Bernoulli pressure causes elastic recoil, causing it to begin to close again. The closing reduces the volume \ufb02ow through the glottis, diminishing the downward forces acting on it. Increased pressure build-up in the sub-glottal region causes the glottis 2 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 to open again. This chain of oscillations continues in a self-sustained fashion throughout phonation until voluntary muscle control intervenes to alter or stop it or as the respiratory volume of air in the lungs is exhausted.

General Approaches to Phonation Modeling Physical models of phonation, e.g., [9,11,15\u201320], attempt to explain this complex physical process using relations derived from actual physics, especially aerodynamics and the physics of mechanical structures. For modeling purposes, we note that phonation is not the only source of excitation of the the vocal tract in producing speechsounds, which comprise both voiced and unvoiced sounds. However, phonation is indeed the primary source of excitation of the vocal tract in the production of voiced sounds, wherein the oscillation of the vocal folds modulates the pressure of the air\ufb02ow to produce a (quasi-) periodic glottal \ufb02ow wave at a fundamental frequency (the pitch), which in turn results in the occurrence of higher order harmonics. The resultant glottal \ufb02ow further excites the vocal tract, which comprises the laryngeal cavity, the pharynx, and the oral and nasal cavities, to produce individual sounds. The vocal tract serves as a resonance chamber that produces formants. The identities of the different sounds produced within it are derived from these resonances, which in turn are largely dependent on the con\ufb01gurations of the vocal tract speci\ufb01ed by their time-varying cross- sectional area. From this perspective, phonation modeling has typically involved the modeling of two sub-processes: the self-sustained vibration of the vocal folds, and the propagation of the resultant pressure wave through the vocal tract [21].

General Approaches to Phonation Modeling Physical models of phonation, e.g., [9,11,15\u201320], attempt to explain this complex physical process using relations derived from actual physics, especially aerodynamics and the physics of mechanical structures. For modeling purposes, we note that phonation is not the only source of excitation of the the vocal tract in producing speechsounds, which comprise both voiced and unvoiced sounds. However, phonation is indeed the primary source of excitation of the vocal tract in the production of voiced sounds, wherein the oscillation of the vocal folds modulates the pressure of the air\ufb02ow to produce a (quasi-) periodic glottal \ufb02ow wave at a fundamental frequency (the pitch), which in turn results in the occurrence of higher order harmonics. The resultant glottal \ufb02ow further excites the vocal tract, which comprises the laryngeal cavity, the pharynx, and the oral and nasal cavities, to produce individual sounds. The vocal tract serves as a resonance chamber that produces formants. The identities of the different sounds produced within it are derived from these resonances, which in turn are largely dependent on the con\ufb01gurations of the vocal tract speci\ufb01ed by their time-varying cross- sectional area. From this perspective, phonation modeling has typically involved the modeling of two sub-processes: the self-sustained vibration of the vocal folds, and the propagation of the resultant pressure wave through the vocal tract [21]. Each sub-process model has associated parameters that determine the model output, given an input. Following the above division of the process, we identify the two following model types, each modeling one of the sub-processes: (i) Vocal fold oscillation (VFO) models (also called vocal folds models, or oscillation models), and (ii) vocal tract (VT) models. The VFO models describe the vibration of vocal folds and their aerodynamic interac- tion with air\ufb02ow. Such models are of four broad types: one-mass models, e.g., [2,16,22\u201324], two-mass models, e.g., [11,15], multi-mass models [18], and \ufb01nite element models, e.g., [17]. 3 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Each of these has proven to be useful in different contexts. The VT models describe the in- teraction of the glottal pressure wave with the vocal tract, which is turn has been described in the literature by varied models, such as statistical models, e.g., [25], geometric models, e.g., [26] and biomechanical models, e.g., [27]. In addition, different models are also applied to describe the aero-acoustic interaction of the glottal air\ufb02ow and the vocal tract. Some examples of these are re\ufb02ection-type line analog models and transmission line circuit analog models, e.g., [28], hybrid time-frequency domain models, e.g., [29] and \ufb01nite-element models, e.g., [30]. 2. The Problem of Parameter Estimation Each of the models mentioned in Section 1.2 includes a set of parameters that determine its state, and output, given an input. For instance, given the parameters for a VFO model, the glottal \ufb02ow waveform can be determined; given the glottal \ufb02ow waveform as an input, and the parameters for a VFO model, the acoustic signal can be determined. The problem we tackle in this paper is the inverse problem: given a model output, we must estimate the model parameters from it. This can be of great practical use. For example, with speaker-speci\ufb01c parameter setting, the output of these models can be used as a proxy for the actual vocal fold motion of the corresponding speaker. To obtain the parameters"}], "doc_text": "in the laryngeal region that initiate and maintain phonation relate to (a) pressure balances and air\ufb02ow dynamics within the supra-glottal and sub-glottal regions and (b) muscular control within the glottis and the larynx. The balance of forces necessary to cause self-sustained vibrations during phonation is created by physical phenomena such as the Bernoulli effect and the Coand\u02c7a effect [6\u20138]. Figure 1 illustrates the interaction between these effects that is largely thought to drive the oscillations of the vocal folds. The process of phonation begins with the closing of the glottis. This closure is voluntary and facilitated by the laryngeal muscles. Once closed, the muscles do not actively play a role in sustaining the vibrations. Glottal closure is followed by a contraction of the lungs which pushes out air and causes an increase in pressure just below the glottis. When this subglottal pressure crosses a threshold, the vocal folds are pushed apart, and air rushes out of the narrow glottal opening into the much wider supra-glottal region, creating negative intra-glottal pressure (with reference to atmospheric air pressure) [9]. The exact physics of the air\ufb02ow through the glottis during phonation is well studied, e.g., [2,10\u201314]. The current understanding from these, from the air\ufb02ow perspective, is that the glottis forms a \ufb02ow separation plane. The air expansion in this region and the low pressure created in the vicinity of the glottis through the Coand\u02c7a effect-induced entrainment cause a lowering of pressure close to the glottis and a net downward force on the glottis. At the same time, lowered pressure in the glottal region due to the Bernoulli effect that ensues from the high-velocity air volume \ufb02ow through the glottis exerts a negative force on the glottis. The negative Bernoulli pressure causes elastic recoil, causing it to begin to close again. The closing reduces the volume \ufb02ow through the glottis, diminishing the downward forces acting on it. Increased pressure build-up in the sub-glottal region causes the glottis 2 of 39 Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 to open again. This chain of oscillations continues in a self-sustained fashion throughout phonation until voluntary muscle control intervenes to alter or stop it or as the respiratory volume of air in the lungs is exhausted.
