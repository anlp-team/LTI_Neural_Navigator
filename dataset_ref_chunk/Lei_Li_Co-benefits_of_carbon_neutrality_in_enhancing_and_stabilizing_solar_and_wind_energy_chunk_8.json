In CovidMIP, the baseline scenario follows the SSP2-4.5, a medium pathway of future greenhouse gas emissions with a global mean warming of about 2 \u00b0C in the 2050s and 2.6 \u00b0C in 210055. Accounting for anthropogenic emissions decline during the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible fast renewable transition during the post-pandemic recovery, CovidMIP produced two carbon-neutral pathways from 2020 to 2050: a moderate green recovery (MOD) and a strong green recovery (STR)35. These two carbon-neutral scenarios both include a \u2018two-year-blip\u2019 period (2020\u20132021), which is not the focus of our analysis here, followed by the moderate MOD and faster STR scenarios towards reaching global carbon neutrality by 2060 and 2050, respectively. \u23a7 \u23aa \u23a8 \u23aa \u23a9 [j] \u02dcX obs = X [j] \u02dcX hist = X [j] \u02dcX proj = X [j] obsR[j] [j] histR[j] [j] projR[j] Second, the quantile delta mapping method uses the same empiri- cal cumulative distribution function (CDF) for simulations (historical and future) and observation, but it preserves the signal of future changes in climate projections61.

All four models provided large ensemble simulations (30-member for ACCESS-ESM-5 and MIROC-ES2L, and 10-member for MPI-ESM1-2-LR and MRI-ESM2-0), which allows a robust quantification of projection uncertainty. In addition, the same number of simulations for each model (as in Supplementary Table 1) are selected from the historical experiment (1995\u20132014) from CMIP6 to evaluate model skill and correct biases, and to provide a base period to quantify future changes of solar PV and wind energy. In this study, we first calculate renewable energy in individual ensemble members, which is then averaged to each model and the multi-model generation.

ERA5 has been evaluated extensively in earlier studies and is found to be one of the best global reanalysis products56,57, widely used as a benchmark to evaluate and correct model simulations58,59. An early study showed that the ERA5 reanalysis overestimated global I by 4.05 W m\u22122 (~3%) using site-based solar radia- tion from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network57. Here, we further evaluate T and W from the ERA5 reanalysis based on global observa- tions at 3,511 weather stations. Compared with observations, the ERA5 reanalysis well captures global T and W with low normalized mean biases of \u22120.2% and 3.0%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9), much smaller than model\u2013ERA5 discrepancy (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). To maintain the consistency of spatial resolution among the four ESMs, both reanalysis and model outputs are re-gridded to a median resolution of 2 \u00d7 2\u00b0 using the bilinear interpolation method. To improve the robustness of the model projection, we use the multi- variate bias correction technique based on the n-dimensional prob- ability density function transform (MBCn) to simultaneously correct daily T, I and W in historical and future model simulations using the ERA5 reanalysis as the benchmark.

In CovidMIP, the baseline scenario follows the SSP2-4.5, a medium pathway of future greenhouse gas emissions with a global mean warming of about 2 \u00b0C in the 2050s and 2.6 \u00b0C in 210055. Accounting for anthropogenic emissions decline during the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible fast renewable transition during the post-pandemic recovery, CovidMIP produced two carbon-neutral pathways from 2020 to 2050: a moderate green recovery (MOD) and a strong green recovery (STR)35. These two carbon-neutral scenarios both include a \u2018two-year-blip\u2019 period (2020\u20132021), which is not the focus of our analysis here, followed by the moderate MOD and faster STR scenarios towards reaching global carbon neutrality by 2060 and 2050, respectively. \u23a7 \u23aa \u23a8 \u23aa \u23a9 [j] \u02dcX obs = X [j] \u02dcX hist = X [j] \u02dcX proj = X [j] obsR[j] [j] histR[j] [j] projR[j] Second, the quantile delta mapping method uses the same empiri- cal cumulative distribution function (CDF) for simulations (historical and future) and observation, but it preserves the signal of future changes in climate projections61.

All four models provided large ensemble simulations (30-member for ACCESS-ESM-5 and MIROC-ES2L, and 10-member for MPI-ESM1-2-LR and MRI-ESM2-0), which allows a robust quantification of projection uncertainty. In addition, the same number of simulations for each model (as in Supplementary Table 1) are selected from the historical experiment (1995\u20132014) from CMIP6 to evaluate model skill and correct biases, and to provide a base period to quantify future changes of solar PV and wind energy. In this study, we first calculate renewable energy in individual ensemble members, which is then averaged to each model and the multi-model generation.

To maintain the consistency of spatial resolution among the four ESMs, both reanalysis and model outputs are re-gridded to a median resolution of 2 \u00d7 2\u00b0 using the bilinear interpolation method.

In CovidMIP, the baseline scenario follows the SSP2-4.5, a medium pathway of future greenhouse gas emissions with a global mean warming of about 2 \u00b0C in the 2050s and 2.6 \u00b0C in 210055. Accounting for anthropogenic emissions decline during the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible fast renewable transition during the post-pandemic recovery, CovidMIP produced two carbon-neutral pathways from 2020 to 2050: a moderate green recovery (MOD) and a strong green recovery (STR)35. These two carbon-neutral scenarios both include a \u2018two-year-blip\u2019 period (2020\u20132021), which is not the focus of our analysis here, followed by the moderate MOD and faster STR scenarios towards reaching global carbon neutrality by 2060 and 2050, respectively. \u23a7 \u23aa \u23a8 \u23aa \u23a9 [j] \u02dcX obs = X [j] \u02dcX hist = X [j] \u02dcX proj = X [j] obsR[j] [j] histR[j] [j] projR[j] Second, the quantile delta mapping method uses the same empiri- cal cumulative distribution function (CDF) for simulations (historical and future) and observation, but it preserves the signal of future changes in climate projections61. This method is applied to obtain [j] bias-corrected datasets in historical and projected simulations ( \u0302X hist and [j] proj): \u0302X \u23a7 [j] \u0302X hist = F\u22121 obs (Fhist (\u02dcX [j] hist)) \u23a8 \u23a9 [j] proj = \u02dcX \u0302X [j] proj + F\u22121 obs (Fproj (\u02dcX [j] proj)) \u2212 F\u22121 hist (Fproj (\u02dcX [j] proj)) (1) (2) Six ESMs participated in CovidMIP, four of which, ACCESS-ESM-5, MIROC-ES2L, MPI-ESM1-2-LR and MRI-ESM2-0 (Supplementary Table 1), are used here, because they made available daily output of surface air temperature (T), surface downwelling shortwave radia- tion (I) and 10 m wind speed (W, calculated by meridional and zonal winds), which are necessary to quantify solar PV and wind energy, especially their day-to-day variability. All four models provided large ensemble simulations (30-member for ACCESS-ESM-5 and MIROC-ES2L, and 10-member for MPI-ESM1-2-LR and MRI-ESM2-0), which allows a robust quantification of projection uncertainty. In addition, the same number of simulations for each model (as in Supplementary Table 1) are selected from the historical experiment (1995\u20132014) from CMIP6 to evaluate model skill and correct biases, and to provide a base period to quantify future changes of solar PV and wind energy. In this study, we first calculate renewable energy in individual ensemble members, which is then averaged to each model and the multi-model generation. Bias correction To evaluate model performance in simulating solar PV and wind energy during the historical period (1995\u20132014), we obtain daily (averaged from hourly) T, I and W (calculated by meridional and zonal winds) from the ERA5 reanalysis. ERA5 has been evaluated extensively in earlier studies and is found to be one of the best global reanalysis products56,57, widely used as a benchmark to evaluate and correct model simulations58,59. An early study showed that the ERA5 reanalysis overestimated global I by 4.05 W m\u22122 (~3%) using site-based solar radia- tion from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network57. Here, we further evaluate T and W from the ERA5 reanalysis based on global observa- tions at 3,511 weather stations. Compared with observations, the ERA5 reanalysis well captures global T and W with low normalized mean biases of \u22120.2% and 3.0%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9), much smaller than model\u2013ERA5 discrepancy (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). To maintain the consistency of spatial resolution among the four ESMs, both reanalysis and model outputs are re-gridded to a median resolution of 2 \u00d7 2\u00b0 using the bilinear interpolation method. To improve the robustness of the model projection, we use the multi- variate bias correction technique based on the n-dimensional prob- ability density function transform (MBCn) to simultaneously correct daily T, I and W in historical and future model simulations using the ERA5 reanalysis as the benchmark.
