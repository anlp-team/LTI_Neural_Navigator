It is often dif\ufb01- cult to tell if a character is \u0142 or l. Because I have some knowledge of the language, I relied on that background knowledge at times, but this slowed down the correc- tion process.\u201d (user2, linguistic researcher, familiar with Kwak\u2019wala) In giving feedback about the keyboard practice tasks, all participants indicated that the practice task helped them learn the Hunt-Boas orthography and the keystroke mappings. Moreover, 100% of the participants stated that as they completed more tasks, they became faster at transcription. One par- ticipant (user7, from Upwork, not familiar with Kwak\u2019wala) stated \u201cAfter transcribing a few pages, I became faster at typing with the keyboard and noticing the different accents and letters.\u201d While the ordering of the tasks was not taken into account in our LME model because of the small amount of data in the current user study, we hope to under- stand the effect of task order on transcription time in future, larger-scale research. 4 Conclusion In this paper, we evaluate the utility of OCR and post-correction models in a user-centric manner. We conduct a case study on Kwak\u2019wala, an endan- gered language with a long history of written docu- mentation that is currently not widely accessible to community-based speakers and researchers. With a user study, we highlight the utility of incorporat- ing OCR to make these texts easier to manually transcribe into machine-readable formats. Our sta- tistical analysis shows that OCR can reduce the time taken by a human transcriber in producing an accurate retyping of the texts by over 50%. While we focus on a single language in this case study, our results demonstrate the immense potential impact that OCR technologies can have on global language documentation and revitalization efforts. Our work, however, is limited in scale and scope \u2013 we do not make statistically signi\ufb01cant conclusions on the ef- fect of prior knowledge of the language; whether the order of pages transcribed has an impact on measured time; and the effect of general familiar- ity with computers and technology. In the future, we hope to conduct a larger-scale evaluation that accounts for these factors; includes transcriptions from a variety of state-of-the-art OCR systems; and expands to more languages, documents, and orthographies.

Because I have some knowledge of the language, I relied on that background knowledge at times, but this slowed down the correc- tion process.\u201d (user2, linguistic researcher, familiar with Kwak\u2019wala) In giving feedback about the keyboard practice tasks, all participants indicated that the practice task helped them learn the Hunt-Boas orthography and the keystroke mappings. Moreover, 100% of the participants stated that as they completed more tasks, they became faster at transcription.

We conduct a case study on Kwak\u2019wala, an endan- gered language with a long history of written docu- mentation that is currently not widely accessible to community-based speakers and researchers. With a user study, we highlight the utility of incorporat- ing OCR to make these texts easier to manually transcribe into machine-readable formats. Our sta- tistical analysis shows that OCR can reduce the time taken by a human transcriber in producing an accurate retyping of the texts by over 50%. While we focus on a single language in this case study, our results demonstrate the immense potential impact that OCR technologies can have on global language documentation and revitalization efforts. Our work, however, is limited in scale and scope \u2013 we do not make statistically signi\ufb01cant conclusions on the ef- fect of prior knowledge of the language; whether the order of pages transcribed has an impact on measured time; and the effect of general familiar- ity with computers and technology. In the future, we hope to conduct a larger-scale evaluation that accounts for these factors; includes transcriptions from a variety of state-of-the-art OCR systems; and expands to more languages, documents, and orthographies.

Because I have some knowledge of the language, I relied on that background knowledge at times, but this slowed down the correc- tion process.\u201d (user2, linguistic researcher, familiar with Kwak\u2019wala) In giving feedback about the keyboard practice tasks, all participants indicated that the practice task helped them learn the Hunt-Boas orthography and the keystroke mappings. Moreover, 100% of the participants stated that as they completed more tasks, they became faster at transcription. One par- ticipant (user7, from Upwork, not familiar with Kwak\u2019wala) stated \u201cAfter transcribing a few pages, I became faster at typing with the keyboard and noticing the different accents and letters.\u201d While the ordering of the tasks was not taken into account in our LME model because of the small amount of data in the current user study, we hope to under- stand the effect of task order on transcription time in future, larger-scale research. 4 Conclusion In this paper, we evaluate the utility of OCR and post-correction models in a user-centric manner. We conduct a case study on Kwak\u2019wala, an endan- gered language with a long history of written docu- mentation that is currently not widely accessible to community-based speakers and researchers. With a user study, we highlight the utility of incorporat- ing OCR to make these texts easier to manually transcribe into machine-readable formats. Our sta- tistical analysis shows that OCR can reduce the time taken by a human transcriber in producing an accurate retyping of the texts by over 50%. While we focus on a single language in this case study, our results demonstrate the immense potential impact that OCR technologies can have on global language documentation and revitalization efforts. Our work, however, is limited in scale and scope \u2013 we do not make statistically signi\ufb01cant conclusions on the ef- fect of prior knowledge of the language; whether the order of pages transcribed has an impact on measured time; and the effect of general familiar- ity with computers and technology. In the future, we hope to conduct a larger-scale evaluation that accounts for these factors; includes transcriptions from a variety of state-of-the-art OCR systems; and expands to more languages, documents, and orthographies.
