C.1 Power Analysis We used G*Power (Faul et al., 2009) to conduct an a priori power analysis for one-way ANOVA. With the goal of having 80% power to detect a moderate effect size of 0.15 at a significance level of 0.05, we yield a target number of 492 participants. C.2 MTurk Setup and Participant Compensation In both the qualification phase and the task phase, we use the following MTurk qualifications: HIT Approval Rate \u2265 98%, Number of HITs Approved \u2265 5000, and location is US. Among the 731 work- ers who participated in the qualification phase, 603 passed, and the workers were paid a median hourly wage of $10.23/h.

C.1 Power Analysis We used G*Power (Faul et al., 2009) to conduct an a priori power analysis for one-way ANOVA. With the goal of having 80% power to detect a moderate effect size of 0.15 at a significance level of 0.05, we yield a target number of 492 participants. C.2 MTurk Setup and Participant Compensation In both the qualification phase and the task phase, we use the following MTurk qualifications: HIT Approval Rate \u2265 98%, Number of HITs Approved \u2265 5000, and location is US. Among the 731 work- ers who participated in the qualification phase, 603 passed, and the workers were paid a median hourly wage of $10.23/h. Among the workers passing qualification, 490 participated in the task phase, in which they were further paid a median hourly wage of $14.4/h. After filtering out workers who failed the qualification questions during the task stage, our user study has 454 remaining participants. C.3 Human Evaluation User Interface We provide comprehensive instructions for users to complete the task, as demonstrated in Figure 6. Figure 7 shows the interface for one of 4 rounds of user training, and Figure 8 shows the labeling interface, both under the MODEL-EXPL condition. C.4 Participant Demographics In the post-study survey, we included a optional demographics survey. Among users who self- identified gender, 53.4% were male, 46.1% were female and 0.4% were non-binary. The majority of participants identified as White (79.9%), 6.5% as Black/African American, 6.0% as Asian/Asian American, 3.6% as Hispanic/Latinx, 3.1% as Mixed/Other, 0.4% as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Is- lander, 0.2% as Middle Eastern and 0.2% as South Asian/Indian American.
