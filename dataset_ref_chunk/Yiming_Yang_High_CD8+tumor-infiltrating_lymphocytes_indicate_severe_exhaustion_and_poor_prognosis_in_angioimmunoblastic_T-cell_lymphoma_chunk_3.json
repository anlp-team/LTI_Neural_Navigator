Further, 20 patients were divided into high- and low- expression groups according to the mean expression of CTL and IC, respectively. Compared to those in the low CTL group, the number of cases with IC \u2265 6 tended to increase in the high CTL group (8.3% vs. 50%, p = 0.058) (Supplementary Table 3). 3.5 Analysis of exhaustion-related biological changes in CD8+TILs using RNA sequencing The mean expression levels of CTL-related genes (CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1) (8) was 27.84 (range, 10.59\u2013 Frontiers in Immunology 04 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1228004 65.13). The 20 cases were divided into a high-CTL group (n = 8) and low CTL group (n = 12) based on the mean CTL level. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed two distinct clusters of exhaustive biology-related genes, consistent with the two different CTL-level groups (Figure 6A). Twenty-four DEGs were distributed across 11 biological aspects between the high- and low-CTL groups. Further analysis of the DEG characteristics showed that among the total DEGs, 23 (95.8%) DEGs distributed in 11 aspects were involved in the high CTL group, including IC (HAVCR2, CD244), signaling (S100A11, GPR65), mitochondria (HIF1A), cytokines (IL-6 and IL- 10), cell surface receptors and ligands (FASLG, SLAMF7, IFNGR1, NRP2), homing and migration (CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL5, CCR5, CCL4, CCRL2), membrane biology and vesicle transport (PLSCR1), apoptosis/cell death/caspase and annexin (CASP4), metabolism (GPD2), IFN response (IFIT3), and miscellaneous aspects (C1QC, CTSS). One (4.2%) DEG (NPRL3), distributed in miscellaneous aspects, was detected in the low-CTL group. Chi-square analysis revealed that more DEGs were involved in the high CTL group (p = 0) and covered more biological aspects than the low CTL group (p = 0.004) (Figures 6B, E and Table 4). Besides, the result of gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that exhaustion biology- related genes were enriched in the high CTL group from our dataset (FDR = 0.005) (Figure 7A). Following the protocol described above, AITL cases (n = 51) from the data by Iqbal et al. (GSE19069 and GSE58445) were divided into a high-CTL group (32 cases) and low-CTL group (19 cases) based on the mean CTL level (10.61). The pivotal 24 DEGs obtained from our results were compared between the two groups. Clustering results revealed two distinct clusters (Figure 6C). All 20 DEGs (distributed across 11 biological aspects) were involved in the high CTL group, including IC (HAVCR2), signaling (S100A11, GPR65), mitochondria (HIF1A), cytokines (IL-10), cell surface receptors and ligands (FASLG, SLAMF7, IFNGR1), homing and migration (CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL5, CCR5, CCL4, CCRL2), membrane biology and vesicle transport (PLSCR1), apoptosis/cell death/caspase and annexin (CASP4), metabolism (GPD2), IFN response (IFIT3), and miscellaneous aspects (C1QC, CTSS). The chi-square analysis revealed that more DEGs were involved in the high-CTL group (p = 0) and covered more biological aspects than those in the low-CTL group (p=0) (Figures 6D, F and Table 4). One case in the low-CTL group clustered with the high-CTL group in the study by Iqbal et al. (Figure 6C). Further, the results of GSEA demonstrated that exhaustion biology-related genes were enriched in the high-CTL group from the dataset of Iqbal et al. (FDR = 0.006) (Figure 7B). 3.6 CD8+TILs, CTL and correlation with clinical features The correlations between the proportion of CD8+TILs, CTL levels, and clinical features are shown in Table 5. Patients in the high CD8+TILs and high CTL groups were prone to demonstrate a lower response rate (CR + PR) to treatment and presented with more stage IV disease compared with those in the low CD8+TILs and low CTL groups. frontiersin.org Zhu et al. 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1228004 A B FIGURE 1 T-SNE analysis and marker genes for three major cell types (A) and three T-TILs types (B) in AITL samples detected using scRNA-seq (n = 2).

The 20 cases were divided into a high-CTL group (n = 8) and low CTL group (n = 12) based on the mean CTL level. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed two distinct clusters of exhaustive biology-related genes, consistent with the two different CTL-level groups (Figure 6A). Twenty-four DEGs were distributed across 11 biological aspects between the high- and low-CTL groups. Further analysis of the DEG characteristics showed that among the total DEGs, 23 (95.8%) DEGs distributed in 11 aspects were involved in the high CTL group, including IC (HAVCR2, CD244), signaling (S100A11, GPR65), mitochondria (HIF1A), cytokines (IL-6 and IL- 10), cell surface receptors and ligands (FASLG, SLAMF7, IFNGR1, NRP2), homing and migration (CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL5, CCR5, CCL4, CCRL2), membrane biology and vesicle transport (PLSCR1), apoptosis/cell death/caspase and annexin (CASP4), metabolism (GPD2), IFN response (IFIT3), and miscellaneous aspects (C1QC, CTSS). One (4.2%) DEG (NPRL3), distributed in miscellaneous aspects, was detected in the low-CTL group.

The pivotal 24 DEGs obtained from our results were compared between the two groups. Clustering results revealed two distinct clusters (Figure 6C). All 20 DEGs (distributed across 11 biological aspects) were involved in the high CTL group, including IC (HAVCR2), signaling (S100A11, GPR65), mitochondria (HIF1A), cytokines (IL-10), cell surface receptors and ligands (FASLG, SLAMF7, IFNGR1), homing and migration (CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL5, CCR5, CCL4, CCRL2), membrane biology and vesicle transport (PLSCR1), apoptosis/cell death/caspase and annexin (CASP4), metabolism (GPD2), IFN response (IFIT3), and miscellaneous aspects (C1QC, CTSS).

Further, the results of GSEA demonstrated that exhaustion biology-related genes were enriched in the high-CTL group from the dataset of Iqbal et al. (FDR = 0.006) (Figure 7B). 3.6 CD8+TILs, CTL and correlation with clinical features The correlations between the proportion of CD8+TILs, CTL levels, and clinical features are shown in Table 5. Patients in the high CD8+TILs and high CTL groups were prone to demonstrate a lower response rate (CR + PR) to treatment and presented with more stage IV disease compared with those in the low CD8+TILs and low CTL groups. frontiersin.org Zhu et al. 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1228004 A B FIGURE 1 T-SNE analysis and marker genes for three major cell types (A) and three T-TILs types (B) in AITL samples detected using scRNA-seq (n = 2). The major cell types included T-TILs (CD3D, CD3E, CD3G), B-TILs (CD19, MS4A1, CD79B) and macrophages (CD68, CD14). The T-TILs comprised naive T-TILs (IL7R, TCF7), CD4+TILs (CD4) and CD8+TILs (CD8A, CD8B). 3.7 Survival and prognostic analysis patients with AITL; patients with high CTL levels (\u2265 27.84) detected by RNA-seq (p = 0.181, Figure 8C) also tended to have a poor prognosis. Overall, follow-up data was available for 39 patients, with a follow- up rate of 97.5% (39/40). The follow-up time ranged from 0.3 to 38.5 months, and the median OS time was 24.7 months (95% con\ufb01dence interval: 19.39\u201330.01 months; Figure 8A). High CD8+TILs (\u2265 45.9%) detected by FCM (p = 0.024, Figure 8B) was a signi\ufb01cant risk factor for 4 Discussion AITL has a complex tumor microenvironment (TME), in which tumor cells share close crosstalk with other immune cells, A B FIGURE 2 (A) The expression of CTL and IC genes in CD8+TILs from AITL-1 and AITL-2 detected using scRNA-seq, (B) The expression of CTL and IC genes in CD8-1 cells and CD8-2 cells detected using scRNA-seq (n = 2). The CTL genes included CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1. The IC genes included HAVCR2, CD244, PTGER4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274, CD101, CTLA-4, CD160, LILRB4, and TIGIT. Frontiers in Immunology 05 frontiersin.org Zhu et al. 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1228004 particularly TILs. Among TILs, CD8+TILs are the primary components that deliver anti-tumor responses (11, 12) and serve as favorable prognosticators in many tumors (13). CD8+TILs can exert anti-tumor functions (11) through several pathways such as the release of GZMA and GZMB, Fas-Fas ligand pathway-mediated apoptosis (14, 15), and secretion of in\ufb02ammatory cytokines like IFN-g (16) and TNF-a (17). We previously found that an increase in CD8+TILs had a negative impact on the prognosis of AITL at the protein level"}
