In the population with low level AGR, adenocarcinoma accounted for the majority, and less subjects received more than two chemotherapy lines previously compared with those in the high level AGR group. The univariate analysis of OS The results of univariate analysis were shown in Table 2. The results of univariate analysis showed that female, albumin and AGR (Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.84, p = 0.0105) were positively associated with OS.

The relationship between AGR and OS The results of multivariate linear regression model were shown in Table 3. The non-adjusted model showed that for each additional unit increase of AGR, there was approximately a 53% lower risk of death (95% CI: 0.26 to 0.84, p = 0.0105).

By two-piecewise linear regression model and recursive algorithm, we figured out the inflection point was 1.24. On the right of inflection point (AGR > 1.24), the hazard ratio, 95% CI and p value were 0.20, 0.07 to 0.57 and 0.0025, respectively.

The results of subgroup analyses The analyses of non-linear relationship In this present study, we analyzed the non-linear relation- ship between AGR and OS (Fig. 2). The result of smooth curve through the generalized additive model showed that the relationship between AGR and OS was non-lin- ear (after fully adjusted). We compared linear regression model (fitting the relationship between AGR and OS by As is shown in Fig. 4, the tests of interactions were sig- nificant for ECOG PS score (p for interaction = 0.0144), while the tests of interaction were not statistically sig- nificant for other covariants (all the p values for inter- actions were larger than 0.05) (ALK rearrangement was not included in subgroup analysis because the sample size in the subgroup was less than 10).

Compared with low level AGR group, patients had a significantly lower age, leukocyte, platelets and globulin in the high level AGR group. The opposite pattern was observed in albumin. In the population with low level AGR, adenocarcinoma accounted for the majority, and less subjects received more than two chemotherapy lines previously compared with those in the high level AGR group. The univariate analysis of OS The results of univariate analysis were shown in Table 2. The results of univariate analysis showed that female, albumin and AGR (Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.84, p = 0.0105) were positively associated with OS. We also found that age, never smoker, hypertension, ALK Page 4 of 10 Fig. 1 Flowchart of the study participants enrollment rearrangement, EGFR mutation, histology, tumor stage, ECOG PS score, number of metastases, number of pre- vious treatment lines, number of previous chemotherapy lines, previous targeted therapy, previous radiotherapy, previous immunotherapy, anlotinib monotherapy, leuko- cyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelets and globulin were not associated with OS. The relationship between AGR and OS The results of multivariate linear regression model were shown in Table 3. The non-adjusted model showed that for each additional unit increase of AGR, there was approximately a 53% lower risk of death (95% CI: 0.26 to 0.84, p = 0.0105). In minimally adjusted model (only adjusted for age, gender and never smoker), the results did not have notable changes (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.96, p = 0.0365). After adjusting other potential covari- ates, AGR in the fully-adjusted model was still positively associated with OS (HR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.88, p = 0.0230). For sensitivity analysis, we also converted the AGR into categorical variable by tertile and figured out p for trend. In fully-adjusted model, compared with the reference of low group, the estimated reduce of the risk of death in the middle and high group were 35% and 51%, respectively. The p for the trend was 0.0277. a linear regression) and two-piecewise linear regression model (fitting the relationship between AGR and OS by a curve) (Table 4). The p for log-likelihood ratio test was less than 0.05, which indicated that the two-piecewise linear regression model should be used to fit the rela- tionship between AGR and OS. By two-piecewise linear regression model and recursive algorithm, we figured out the inflection point was 1.24. On the right of inflection point (AGR > 1.24), the hazard ratio, 95% CI and p value were 0.20, 0.07 to 0.57 and 0.0025, respectively. How- ever, on the left side of the inflection point (AGR \u2264 1.24), we did not observe an association between AGR and OS (HR = 13.05, 95% CI: 0.52 to 327.64, p = 0.1183). The results of Kaplan-Meier analyses Figure 3 showed the Kaplan-Meier curves of overall sur- vival in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlo- tinib, stratified by AGR groups. The median OS in low, middle and high AGR groups were 12.26, 14.59 and 20.13 months, respectively (after fully adjusted). These differ- ences between different groups were statistically signifi- cant (the p value of the log-rank test was less than 0.05). The results of subgroup analyses The analyses of non-linear relationship In this present study, we analyzed the non-linear relation- ship between AGR and OS (Fig. 2). The result of smooth curve through the generalized additive model showed that the relationship between AGR and OS was non-lin- ear (after fully adjusted). We compared linear regression model (fitting the relationship between AGR and OS by As is shown in Fig. 4, the tests of interactions were sig- nificant for ECOG PS score (p for interaction = 0.0144), while the tests of interaction were not statistically sig- nificant for other covariants (all the p values for inter- actions were larger than 0.05) (ALK rearrangement was not included in subgroup analysis because the sample size in the subgroup was less than 10). For patients with the ECOG PS score = 0, a high AGR was associated with favorable prognosis, demonstrating a 77% lower risk of Page 5 of 10 Table 1 Baseline characteristics of participants according to the tertiles of AGR (n = 196).
