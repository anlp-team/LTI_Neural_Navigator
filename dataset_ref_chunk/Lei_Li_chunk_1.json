The diurnal variations in D50 suggested that the local primary emissions significantly enhanced D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had less influence on D50 at SS = 0.1% due to the limited size (<150 nm) of particles emitted from primary sources.

At a specific SS, D50 decreased with increases in the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal mixing degree during atmospheric aging was beneficial to CCN activation.

In this paper, a high-pressure and high-temperature oil\u2013gas diffusion experimental device was built, which was used to study the effects of the porous medium, pressure, permeability, and fracture on oil\u2013gas diffusion under tight reservoir conditions. Two mathematical models were used to calculate the diffusion coefficients of natural gas in bulk oil and cores. Besides, the numerical simulation model was established to study the diffusion characteristics of natural gas in gas flooding and huff-n-puff, and five diffusion coefficients were selected based on experimental results for simulation study. The remaining oil saturation of grids, the recovery of single layers, and the distribution of CH4 mole fraction in oil were analyzed based on the simulation results. The experimental results show that the diffusion process can be divided into three stages: the initial stage of instability, the diffusion stage, and the stable stage. The absence of medium, high pressure, high permeability, and the existence of fracture are beneficial to natural gas diffusion, which can also reduce the equilibrium time and increase the gas pressure drop. Furthermore, the existence of fracture is beneficial to the early diffusion of gas. The simulation results show that the diffusion coefficient has a greater influence on the oil recovery of huff-n-puff.

However, each arm's reverse-biased voltage (RBV) is uncontrolled in this method. In this case, the dc fault current will concentrate into two of the six arms. Thus, the maximum arm current will increase to the fault current in the dc line, which will lead to arm overcurrent. Moreover, full-bridge submodules (FB-SMs) will be charged by the large arm currents and may suffer from severe overvoltage. The arm overcurrent and FB-SM overvoltage problems have not been solved properly. This letter proposes a method to control the RBV of each arm during the dc fault-clearing process to relieve the arm overcurrent and FB-SM overvoltage. Thus, the safety of the converter can be improved. In the meantime, the impact on the dc fault clearing time is well limited.
