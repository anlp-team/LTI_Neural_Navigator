Mixing State and Its Impacts on CCN Activity As introduced in Section 2.3.1, the ratio of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 can be used to describe the external-mixing degree of aerosol components. The relationships between (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 and D50 under di\ufb00erent SS conditions are shown in Figure 5. Jur\u00e1nyi et al. (2013) pointed out that the (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 varied from 0.08 to 0.12 for ammonium sulfate calibration meas-urements at SS = 0.1\u20131.0%, which indicated an internal mixture within measurement ac-curacy [46]. For our measurements, the value of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 distributed in a range of 0.14\u20130.59, with a median value of 0.31, 0.31, and 0.33 at SS = 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3%, respec-tively. The higher (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 at SS = 0.3% suggested the smaller particles (Dp < 100nm) tended to be more external mixing. The (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 in this study is signi\ufb01cantly higher than that in a rural background site [31], where the (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 ranged from 0.15 to 0.20 at SS = 0.1 to 0.7%.

Correlation between the ratio of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 and D50 at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, re-spectively. The solid circle, error bars denote the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. For a speci\ufb01c SS, D50 decreased with an increase in the degree of internal mixing, im-plying that enhancing the internal mixing level facilitated the CCN activity. Particularly, the variation in the mixing state exhibits high sensitivity to D50 when the ratio drops from 0.5 to 0.3. This can be attributed to the increases in the internal mixing level during the aerosol aging process, leading to an enhancement in aerosol chemical homogeneity and hygroscopicity. The relationship between (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 and D50 can be well \ufb01tted with an exponential function under the conditions of SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. However, under the condition of SS = 0.1%, their relationship is hard to be adequately \ufb01tted. Further analysis of the relationship (SS = 0.1%) revealed that the relatively high values of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 (0.3\u20130.4) with small D50 (<165 nm) occurred under high PM2.5 concentration (>60 \u00b5g m\u22123) and high RH (>60%) conditions (Figure S2), leading to the relationship deviated from sat-isfactory \ufb01tting by using an exponential function. Under these conditions, the hygrosco-picity and size of aerosol particles were enlarged due to the increasing fraction of nitrate and hygroscopic growth, respectively. Especially for the fog period, the droplets had a more diverse population of \u03ba values, as separated by some of them already condensing droplets. However, after passing through the sampling line and being dried, these en-larged particles experienced a reduction in liquid water content and particle size. As a result, the measured dry particles represent a mixture of ambient particles (or droplets) from a wider size range with various \u03ba values, thereby exhibiting a special kind of chem-ical inhomogeneity. 4.2. Estimating Organic Aerosol Hygroscopicity The size-resolved \u03baccn can be derived from size-resolved CCN measurements by us-ing the D50 at various SS. Figure 6 shows the relationships between the \u03baccn and Dp at var-ious environmental sites in China, including urban, rural, coast, and mountain sites. As can be seen, \u03baccn exhibited a positive correlation with Dp at most of those sites except for mountain site, which had a higher \u03baccn for the smaller particles. In these results, \u03baccn rapidly increased with particle size at the range of ~40 to 100 nm, whereas \u03baccn almost stays con-stant at Dp of 100 to 200 nm. This is consistent with previously reported results on the size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions [27], which presented a substantially varying composition within small particle size range and relatively stable compositions for larger particles. In addition, the \u03baccn observed at urban sites were signi\ufb01cantly lower than that at rural sites, which can be attributed to the"}, {"question": " What values did (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 vary from for ammonium sulfate calibration measurements?", "answer": " 0.08 to 0.12 at SS = 0.1\u20131.0%", "ref_chunk": "are colored by the PM2.5 mass concentration.

Further analysis of the relationship (SS = 0.1%) revealed that the relatively high values of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 (0.3\u20130.4) with small D50 (<165 nm) occurred under high PM2.5 concentration (>60 \u00b5g m\u22123) and high RH (>60%) conditions (Figure S2), leading to the relationship deviated from sat-isfactory \ufb01tting by using an exponential function. Under these conditions, the hygrosco-picity and size of aerosol particles were enlarged due to the increasing fraction of nitrate and hygroscopic growth, respectively. Especially for the fog period, the droplets had a more diverse population of \u03ba values, as separated by some of them already condensing droplets. However, after passing through the sampling line and being dried, these en-larged particles experienced a reduction in liquid water content and particle size. As a result, the measured dry particles represent a mixture of ambient particles (or droplets) from a wider size range with various \u03ba values, thereby exhibiting a special kind of chem-ical inhomogeneity. 4.2. Estimating Organic Aerosol Hygroscopicity The size-resolved \u03baccn can be derived from size-resolved CCN measurements by us-ing the D50 at various SS. Figure 6 shows the relationships between the \u03baccn and Dp at var-ious environmental sites in China, including urban, rural, coast, and mountain sites. As can be seen, \u03baccn exhibited a positive correlation with Dp at most of those sites except for mountain site, which had a higher \u03baccn for the smaller particles. In these results, \u03baccn rapidly increased with particle size at the range of ~40 to 100 nm, whereas \u03baccn almost stays con-stant at Dp of 100 to 200 nm. This is consistent with previously reported results on the size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions [27], which presented a substantially varying composition within small particle size range and relatively stable compositions for larger particles.

For a speci\ufb01c SS, D50 decreased with an increase in the degree of internal mixing, im-plying that enhancing the internal mixing level facilitated the CCN activity. Particularly, the variation in the mixing state exhibits high sensitivity to D50 when the ratio drops from 0.5 to 0.3.

The higher (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 at SS = 0.3% suggested the smaller particles (Dp < 100 nm) tended to be more external mixing. The (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 in this study is signi\ufb01cantly higher than that in a rural background site [31], where the (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 ranged from 0.15 to 0.20 at SS = 0.1 to 0.7%. Compared with the rural background site, aerosol particles in urban Beijing represent a more complex mixture originating from local anthropogenic emissions and regional transport. SS = 0.3% Figure 5. Correlation between the ratio of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 and D50 at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, re-spectively. The solid circle, error bars denote the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. For a speci\ufb01c SS, D50 decreased with an increase in the degree of internal mixing, im-plying that enhancing the internal mixing level facilitated the CCN activity. Particularly, the variation in the mixing state exhibits high sensitivity to D50 when the ratio drops from 0.5 to 0.3. This can be attributed to the increases in the internal mixing level during the aerosol aging process, leading to an enhancement in aerosol chemical homogeneity and hygroscopicity. The relationship between (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 and D50 can be well \ufb01tted with an exponential function under the conditions of SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. However, under the condition of SS = 0.1%, their relationship is hard to be adequately \ufb01tted. Further analysis of the relationship (SS = 0.1%) revealed that the relatively high values of (D75 \u2212 D25)/D50 (0.3\u20130.4) with small D50 (<165 nm) occurred under high PM2.5 concentration (>60 \u00b5g m\u22123) and high RH (>60%) conditions (Figure S2), leading to the relationship deviated from sat-isfactory \ufb01tting by using an exponential function. Under these conditions, the hygrosco-picity and size of aerosol particles were enlarged due to the increasing fraction of nitrate and hygroscopic growth, respectively. Especially for the fog period, the droplets had a more diverse population of \u03ba values, as separated by some of them already condensing droplets. However, after passing through the sampling line and being dried, these en-larged particles experienced a reduction in liquid water content and particle size. As a result, the measured dry particles represent a mixture of ambient particles (or droplets) from a wider size range with various \u03ba values, thereby exhibiting a special kind of chem-ical inhomogeneity. 4.2. Estimating Organic Aerosol Hygroscopicity The size-resolved \u03baccn can be derived from size-resolved CCN measurements by us-ing the D50 at various SS. Figure 6 shows the relationships between the \u03baccn and Dp at var-ious environmental sites in China, including urban, rural, coast, and mountain sites. As can be seen, \u03baccn exhibited a positive correlation with Dp at most of those sites except for mountain site, which had a higher \u03baccn for the smaller particles. In these results, \u03baccn rapidly increased with particle size at the range of ~40 to 100 nm, whereas \u03baccn almost stays con-stant at Dp of 100 to 200 nm. This is consistent with previously reported results on the size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions [27], which presented a substantially varying composition within small particle size range and relatively stable compositions for larger particles.
