Analysis of OAV Values of Schisandra chinensis Branch Exudates and Dried Fruit and Screening of Key Flavor Substances VIP values can only indicate the contribution of volatile components, and do not fully represent the composition of odors. The true olfactory composition of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit cannot be determined solely by VIP values. The introduc- tion of odor activity values (OAV) is necessary to determine the aroma characteristics of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit. Calculating OAV values can more intuitively show the contribution of a single component to the overall aroma. It is generally believed that: OAV > 1 can be considered to have a certain impact on the aroma of the sample, and OAV > 10 proves that the aroma component has a great impact on the aroma of the sample. Calculate the OAV values and standard deviations of each aroma component in the branch exudates and Schisandra chinensis dried fruit, and screen according to the standard of OAV > 1, and then perform correlation analysis. The internal standard method is used to quantify the chemical substances detected in six groups of samples. The internal standard is 4-methyl-2-pentanol with a concentration of 198 ppb and a signal peak volume of 504.95. Therefore, the intensity of each signal peak is about 0.392 ppb. The detected chemical substances are analyzed and calculated to \ufb01nally obtain the concentration and standard deviation of three repeated injections of each chemical substance. Schisandra chinensis dried fruit selects the air threshold, and Schisandra chinensis branch exudates selects the water threshold. A total of 57 components can query the threshold value and calculate according to the method described above. After screening, W1 has 15 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 8 aroma components greater than 10; W2 has 15 aroma components with OAV val- ues greater than 1 and 8 aroma components greater than 10; W3 has 14 aroma compo- nents with OAV values greater than 1 and 8 aroma components greater than 10; W4 has 24 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 12 aroma components greater than 10; W5 has a total of 22 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 14 aroma components greater than 10; W6 has a total of 22 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 10 aroma components greater than 10.

Analysis of OAV Values of Schisandra chinensis Branch Exudates and Dried Fruit and Screening of Key Flavor Substances VIP values can only indicate the contribution of volatile components, and do not fully represent the composition of odors. The true olfactory composition of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit cannot be determined solely by VIP values. The introduc- tion of odor activity values (OAV) is necessary to determine the aroma characteristics of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit. Calculating OAV values can more intuitively show the contribution of a single component to the overall aroma. It is generally believed that: OAV > 1 can be considered to have a certain impact on the aroma of the sample, and OAV > 10 proves that the aroma component has a great impact on the aroma of the sample. Calculate the OAV values and standard deviations of each aroma component in the branch exudates and Schisandra chinensis dried fruit, and screen according to the standard of OAV > 1, and then perform correlation analysis. The internal standard method is used to quantify the chemical substances detected in six groups of samples. The internal standard is 4-methyl-2-pentanol with a concentration of 198 ppb and a signal peak volume of 504.95. Therefore, the intensity of each signal peak is about 0.392 ppb. The detected chemical substances are analyzed and calculated to \ufb01nally obtain the concentration and standard deviation of three repeated injections of each chemical substance. Schisandra chinensis dried fruit selects the air threshold, and Schisandra chinensis branch exudates selects the water threshold. A total of 57 components can query the threshold value and calculate according to the method described above. After screening, W1 has 15 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 8 aroma components greater than 10; W2 has 15 aroma components with OAV val- ues greater than 1 and 8 aroma components greater than 10; W3 has 14 aroma compo- nents with OAV values greater than 1 and 8 aroma components greater than 10; W4 has 24 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 12 aroma components greater than 10; W5 has a total of 22 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 14 aroma components greater than 10; W6 has a total of 22 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 10 aroma components greater than 10.

Analysis of OAV Values of Schisandra chinensis Branch Exudates and Dried Fruit and Screening of Key Flavor Substances VIP values can only indicate the contribution of volatile components, and do not fully represent the composition of odors. The true olfactory composition of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit cannot be determined solely by VIP values. The introduc- tion of odor activity values (OAV) is necessary to determine the aroma characteristics of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit. Calculating OAV values can more intuitively show the contribution of a single component to the overall aroma. It is generally believed that: OAV > 1 can be considered to have a certain impact on the aroma of the sample, and OAV > 10 proves that the aroma component has a great impact on the aroma of the sample. Calculate the OAV values and standard deviations of each aroma component in the branch exudates and Schisandra chinensis dried fruit, and screen according to the standard of OAV > 1, and then perform correlation analysis. The internal standard method is used to quantify the chemical substances detected in six groups of samples. The internal standard is 4-methyl-2-pentanol with a concentration of 198 ppb and a signal peak volume of 504.95. Therefore, the intensity of each signal peak is about 0.392 ppb. The detected chemical substances are analyzed and calculated to \ufb01nally obtain the concentration and standard deviation of three repeated injections of each chemical substance. Schisandra chinensis dried fruit selects the air threshold, and Schisandra chinensis branch exudates selects the water threshold. A total of 57 components can query the threshold value and calculate according to the method described above. After screening, W1 has 15 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 8 aroma components greater than 10; W2 has 15 aroma components with OAV val- ues greater than 1 and 8 aroma components greater than 10; W3 has 14 aroma compo- nents with OAV values greater than 1 and 8 aroma components greater than 10; W4 has 24 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 12 aroma components greater than 10; W5 has a total of 22 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 14 aroma components greater than 10; W6 has a total of 22 aroma components with OAV values greater than 1 and 10 aroma components greater than 10.

Analysis of OAV Values of Schisandra chinensis Branch Exudates and Dried Fruit and Screening of Key Flavor Substances VIP values can only indicate the contribution of volatile components, and do not fully represent the composition of odors. The true olfactory composition of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit cannot be determined solely by VIP values. The introduc- tion of odor activity values (OAV) is necessary to determine the aroma characteristics of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit. Calculating OAV values can more intuitively show the contribution of a single component to the overall aroma. It is generally believed that: OAV > 1 can be considered to have a certain impact on the aroma of the sample, and OAV > 10 proves that the aroma component has a great impact on the aroma of the sample. Calculate the OAV values and standard deviations of each aroma component in the branch exudates and Schisandra chinensis dried fruit, and screen according to the standard of OAV > 1, and then perform correlation analysis. The internal standard method is used to quantify the chemical substances detected in six groups of samples. The internal standard is 4-methyl-2-pentanol with a concentration of 198 ppb and a signal peak volume of 504.95. Therefore, the intensity of each signal peak is about 0.392 ppb. The detected chemical substances are analyzed and calculated to \ufb01nally obtain the concentration and standard deviation of three repeated injections of each chemical substance. Schisandra chinensis dried fruit selects the air threshold, and Schisandra chinensis branch exudates selects the water threshold. A total of 57 components can query the threshold value and calculate according to the method described above.

Analysis of OAV Values of Schisandra chinensis Branch Exudates and Dried Fruit and Screening of Key Flavor Substances VIP values can only indicate the contribution of volatile components, and do not fully represent the composition of odors. The true olfactory composition of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit cannot be determined solely by VIP values. The introduc- tion of odor activity values (OAV) is necessary to determine the aroma characteristics of Schisandra chinensis branch exudates and dried fruit. Calculating OAV values can more intuitively show the contribution of a single component to the overall aroma. It is generally believed that: OAV > 1 can be considered to have a certain impact on the aroma of the sample, and OAV > 10 proves that the aroma component has a great impact on the aroma of the sample. Calculate the OAV values and standard deviations of each aroma component in the branch exudates and Schisandra chinensis dried fruit, and screen according to the standard of OAV > 1, and then perform correlation analysis. The internal standard method is used to quantify the chemical substances detected in six groups of samples. The internal standard is 4-methyl-2-pentanol with a concentration of 198 ppb and a signal peak volume of 504.95. Therefore, the intensity of each signal peak is about 0.392 ppb. The detected chemical substances are analyzed and calculated to \ufb01nally obtain the concentration and standard deviation of three repeated injections of each chemical substance. Schisandra chinensis dried fruit selects the air threshold, and Schisandra chinensis branch exudates selects the water threshold. A total of 57 components can query the threshold value and calculate according to the method described above.
