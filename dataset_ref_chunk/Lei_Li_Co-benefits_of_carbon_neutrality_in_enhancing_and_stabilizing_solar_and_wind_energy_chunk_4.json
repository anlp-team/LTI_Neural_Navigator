Changes in temporal variability of solar PV and wind energy Temporal variability is a key aspect of renewable energy sources, which strongly affects the stability of energy supply, leading to concerns about its large-scale deployment. Therefore, quantifying how the temporal variability of solar PV and wind energy changes in future is crucial for planning complementary energy sources and storage to secure a stable and reliable energy supply. WP changes are mainly caused by a shift in different wind speed conditions (Equation (9) in Methods). We further show the frequency changes of different wind speeds under future scenarios (Fig. 4). There are obvious changes for days below the cut-in wind speed (W < 3 m s\u22121) and within the ramp-up wind speed (3 \u2264 W \u2264 11), but limited changes in rated-power wind speed (11 < W \u2264 25). Furthermore, spatial patterns of changes in cut-in and ramp-up wind speed days largely resemble those of WP. For example, more days under the ramp-up wind speed and less days in cut-in wind speed are found in eastern China and India (Fig. 4d,e,g,h), contributing favourably to the enhanced WP during 2040\u20132049 under the MOD and STR scenarios relative to the baseline scenario. In regions with weakened WP, such as western Africa, the Using the normalized mean absolute deviation (NMAD), we show the variabilities of solar PVPOT and WP at various time scales in the his- torical period (Extended Data Fig. 5). The global variabilities of solar PVPOT and WP all decrease from daily to monthly, and then to yearly, scales. This is because the seasonal cycle is stronger than inter-annual variation for meteorological variables. However, solar PVPOT and WP show an opposite spatial pattern in all day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year variabilities. From tropical to mid-high latitudes, the variability of solar PVPOT increases (Extended Data Fig. 5a,c,e), while the variability of WP decreases gradually (Extended Data Fig. 5b,d,f). Solar PVPOT mainly depends on sunlight capture and cell temperature. The strong seasonal variation in solar altitude angle in the mid-high lati- tudes causes large disturbance to local surface downwelling shortwave radiation and temperature, leading to unstable solar power output.

Changes in temporal variability of solar PV and wind energy Temporal variability is a key aspect of renewable energy sources, which strongly affects the stability of energy supply, leading to concerns about its large-scale deployment. Therefore, quantifying how the temporal variability of solar PV and wind energy changes in future is crucial for planning complementary energy sources and storage to secure a stable and reliable energy supply. WP changes are mainly caused by a shift in different wind speed conditions (Equation (9) in Methods). We further show the frequency changes of different wind speeds under future scenarios (Fig. 4). There are obvious changes for days below the cut-in wind speed (W < 3 m s\u22121) and within the ramp-up wind speed (3 \u2264 W \u2264 11), but limited changes in rated-power wind speed (11 < W \u2264 25). Furthermore, spatial patterns of changes in cut-in and ramp-up wind speed days largely resemble those of WP. For example, more days under the ramp-up wind speed and less days in cut-in wind speed are found in eastern China and India (Fig. 4d,e,g,h), contributing favourably to the enhanced WP during 2040\u20132049 under the MOD and STR scenarios relative to the baseline scenario. In regions with weakened WP, such as western Africa, the Using the normalized mean absolute deviation (NMAD), we show the variabilities of solar PVPOT and WP at various time scales in the his- torical period (Extended Data Fig. 5). The global variabilities of solar PVPOT and WP all decrease from daily to monthly, and then to yearly, scales. This is because the seasonal cycle is stronger than inter-annual variation for meteorological variables. However, solar PVPOT and WP show an opposite spatial pattern in all day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year variabilities. From tropical to mid-high latitudes, the variability of solar PVPOT increases (Extended Data Fig. 5a,c,e), while the variability of WP decreases gradually (Extended Data Fig. 5b,d,f). Solar PVPOT mainly depends on sunlight capture and cell temperature. The strong seasonal variation in solar altitude angle in the mid-high lati- tudes causes large disturbance to local surface downwelling shortwave radiation and temperature, leading to unstable solar power output.

Changes in temporal variability of solar PV and wind energy Temporal variability is a key aspect of renewable energy sources, which strongly affects the stability of energy supply, leading to concerns about its large-scale deployment. Therefore, quantifying how the temporal variability of solar PV and wind energy changes in future is crucial for planning complementary energy sources and storage to secure a stable and reliable energy supply. WP changes are mainly caused by a shift in different wind speed conditions (Equation (9) in Methods). We further show the frequency changes of different wind speeds under future scenarios (Fig. 4). There are obvious changes for days below the cut-in wind speed (W < 3 m s\u22121) and within the ramp-up wind speed (3 \u2264 W \u2264 11), but limited changes in rated-power wind speed (11 < W \u2264 25). Furthermore, spatial patterns of changes in cut-in and ramp-up wind speed days largely resemble those of WP. For example, more days under the ramp-up wind speed and less days in cut-in wind speed are found in eastern China and India (Fig. 4d,e,g,h), contributing favourably to the enhanced WP during 2040\u20132049 under the MOD and STR scenarios relative to the baseline scenario. In regions with weakened WP, such as western Africa, the Using the normalized mean absolute deviation (NMAD), we show the variabilities of solar PVPOT and WP at various time scales in the his- torical period (Extended Data Fig. 5). The global variabilities of solar PVPOT and WP all decrease from daily to monthly, and then to yearly, scales. This is because the seasonal cycle is stronger than inter-annual variation for meteorological variables. However, solar PVPOT and WP show an opposite spatial pattern in all day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year variabilities. From tropical to mid-high latitudes, the variability of solar PVPOT increases (Extended Data Fig. 5a,c,e), while the variability of WP decreases gradually (Extended Data Fig. 5b,d,f). Solar PVPOT mainly depends on sunlight capture and cell temperature. The strong seasonal variation in solar altitude angle in the mid-high lati- tudes causes large disturbance to local surface downwelling shortwave radiation and temperature, leading to unstable solar power output.

Changes in temporal variability of solar PV and wind energy Temporal variability is a key aspect of renewable energy sources, which strongly affects the stability of energy supply, leading to concerns about its large-scale deployment. Therefore, quantifying how the temporal variability of solar PV and wind energy changes in future is crucial for planning complementary energy sources and storage to secure a stable and reliable energy supply. WP changes are mainly caused by a shift in different wind speed conditions (Equation (9) in Methods). We further show the frequency changes of different wind speeds under future scenarios (Fig. 4). There are obvious changes for days below the cut-in wind speed (W < 3 m s\u22121) and within the ramp-up wind speed (3 \u2264 W \u2264 11), but limited changes in rated-power wind speed (11 < W \u2264 25). Furthermore, spatial patterns of changes in cut-in and ramp-up wind speed days largely resemble those of WP. For example, more days under the ramp-up wind speed and less days in cut-in wind speed are found in eastern China and India (Fig. 4d,e,g,h), contributing favourably to the enhanced WP during 2040\u20132049 under the MOD and STR scenarios relative to the baseline scenario. In regions with weakened WP, such as western Africa, the Using the normalized mean absolute deviation (NMAD), we show the variabilities of solar PVPOT and WP at various time scales in the his- torical period (Extended Data Fig. 5). The global variabilities of solar PVPOT and WP all decrease from daily to monthly, and then to yearly, scales. This is because the seasonal cycle is stronger than inter-annual variation for meteorological variables. However, solar PVPOT and WP show an opposite spatial pattern in all day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year variabilities. From tropical to mid-high latitudes, the variability of solar PVPOT increases (Extended Data Fig. 5a,c,e), while the variability of WP decreases gradually (Extended Data Fig. 5b,d,f). Solar PVPOT mainly depends on sunlight capture and cell temperature. The strong seasonal variation in solar altitude angle in the mid-high lati- tudes causes large disturbance to local surface downwelling shortwave radiation and temperature, leading to unstable solar power output.
