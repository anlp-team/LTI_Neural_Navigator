To study vocal fold behaviors, we are particularly interested in those attractors revealing the periodic motion of the \ufb02ow in phase space. Such attractors include the limit cycle or the limit torus, which are isolated periodic or toroidal orbits, respectively. Some attractor sets have a fractal structure resultant from a chaotic state of the dynamical system [20,54], and are called strange attractors. Figure A1. Illustration of different attractors in a dynamical system. Appendix F.4. Chaos and Exponential Divergence of Phase Space Trajectories Chaos is a characteristic state of a nonlinear dynamical system. There are different de\ufb01nitions of chaos. A simple one is as follows: De\ufb01nition A5 (Chaos). Equip a distance metric d on the phase space M. Then C \u2208 M is referred to as a chaotic set of \u03a6 if, for any x, y \u2208 C, x (cid:54)= y, we have n\u2192\u221e inf d(\u03a6n(x), \u03a6n(y)) = 0 lim n\u2192\u221e sup d(\u03a6n(x), \u03a6n(y)) > 0 lim Thus, by de\ufb01nition, chaos is a state characterized by extreme sensitivity to initial conditions (trajectories starting from any two arbitrarily close initial conditions diverge exponentially). The Lypunov exponent is used to quantify this divergence. It also measures the measures the sensitivity of the evolution of the dynamical system to initial conditions. 36 of 39 (A152) (A153) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Appendix F.5. Stability Attractor sets (of all types) also characterize the stability of dynamical systems. De\ufb01nition A6 (Stability). A compact \u03a6-invariant subset A = \u03a6(A) \u2286 M is called a Lyapunov stable attraction set if 1. 2. It has an open basin of attraction B(A); The Lyapunov stability condition is satis\ufb01ed: every neighborhood U of A contains a smaller neighborhood V such that every iterative forward image \u03a6n(V) is contained in U. Appendix F.6. Poincar\u00e9 Map and Poincar\u00e9 Section To study the trajectory (or orbit) structure of dynamical systems, we use the Poincar\u00e9 map or Poincar\u00e9 section. De\ufb01nition A7 (Poincar\u00e9 map [53]). For an n-dimensional phase space with a periodic orbit \u03b3x, a Poincar\u00e9 section S is an (n \u2212 1)-dimensional section (hyper-plane) that is transverse to \u03b3x. Given an open, connected neighborhood U \u2286 S of x, the Poincar\u00e9 map on Poincar\u00e9 section S is a map P : U \u2192 S, x (cid:55)\u2192 \u03a6x(ts) where ts is the time between the two intersections, satisfying 1. 2. P(U) is a neighborhood of x and P : U \u2192 P(U) is a diffeomorphism; For every point x in U, the positive semi-orbit of x intersects S for the \ufb01rst time at P(x). Appendix F.7. Bifurcation Since the \ufb02ow of a dynamical system in its phase space is a function of its parameters, the topological structure of the trajectories (including attractor sets) in phase space changes as the parameters change. To see how the topological structure changes with system parameters, we study the bifurcation map of the system. De\ufb01nition A8 (Bifurcation). A bifurcation occurs when a small smooth change in a system parameter value causes an abrupt change in the topological structure of the trajectory in phase space. A bifurcation diagram is a visualization of the system\u2019s parameter space showing the number and behavior of attractor sets for each parameter con\ufb01guration. At a bifurcation point, the system stability may change as the topological structure splits or merges, such as the periodic doubling or halving of a limit cycle. References 1. 2. 3. 4. Cveticanin, L.

Given an open, connected neighborhood U \u2286 S of x, the Poincar\u00e9 map on Poincar\u00e9 section S is a map P : U \u2192 S, x (cid:55)\u2192 \u03a6x(ts) where ts is the time between the two intersections, satisfying 1. 2. P(U) is a neighborhood of x and P : U \u2192 P(U) is a diffeomorphism; For every point x in U, the positive semi-orbit of x intersects S for the \ufb01rst time at P(x). Appendix F.7. Bifurcation Since the \ufb02ow of a dynamical system in its phase space is a function of its parameters, the topological structure of the trajectories (including attractor sets) in phase space changes as the parameters change. To see how the topological structure changes with system parameters, we study the bifurcation map of the system. De\ufb01nition A8 (Bifurcation). A bifurcation occurs when a small smooth change in a system parameter value causes an abrupt change in the topological structure of the trajectory in phase space. A bifurcation diagram is a visualization of the system\u2019s parameter space showing the number and behavior of attractor sets for each parameter con\ufb01guration. At a bifurcation point, the system stability may change as the topological structure splits or merges, such as the periodic doubling or halving of a limit cycle. References 1. 2. 3. 4. Cveticanin, L.

To study vocal fold behaviors, we are particularly interested in those attractors revealing the periodic motion of the \ufb02ow in phase space. Such attractors include the limit cycle or the limit torus, which are isolated periodic or toroidal orbits, respectively. Some attractor sets have a fractal structure resultant from a chaotic state of the dynamical system [20,54], and are called strange attractors. Figure A1. Illustration of different attractors in a dynamical system. Appendix F.4. Chaos and Exponential Divergence of Phase Space Trajectories Chaos is a characteristic state of a nonlinear dynamical system. There are different de\ufb01nitions of chaos. A simple one is as follows: De\ufb01nition A5 (Chaos). Equip a distance metric d on the phase space M. Then C \u2208 M is referred to as a chaotic set of \u03a6 if, for any x, y \u2208 C, x (cid:54)= y, we have n\u2192\u221e inf d(\u03a6n(x), \u03a6n(y)) = 0 lim n\u2192\u221e sup d(\u03a6n(x), \u03a6n(y)) > 0 lim Thus, by de\ufb01nition, chaos is a state characterized by extreme sensitivity to initial conditions (trajectories starting from any two arbitrarily close initial conditions diverge exponentially). The Lypunov exponent is used to quantify this divergence. It also measures the measures the sensitivity of the evolution of the dynamical system to initial conditions. 36 of 39 (A152) (A153) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Appendix F.5. Stability Attractor sets (of all types) also characterize the stability of dynamical systems. De\ufb01nition A6 (Stability). A compact \u03a6-invariant subset A = \u03a6(A) \u2286 M is called a Lyapunov stable attraction set if 1. 2. It has an open basin of attraction B(A); The Lyapunov stability condition is satis\ufb01ed: every neighborhood U of A contains a smaller neighborhood V such that every iterative forward image \u03a6n(V) is contained in U. Appendix F.6. Poincar\u00e9 Map and Poincar\u00e9 Section To study the trajectory (or orbit) structure of dynamical systems, we use the Poincar\u00e9 map or Poincar\u00e9 section. De\ufb01nition A7 (Poincar\u00e9 map [53]). For an n-dimensional phase space with a periodic orbit \u03b3x, a Poincar\u00e9 section S is an (n \u2212 1)-dimensional section (hyper-plane) that is transverse to \u03b3x. Given an open, connected neighborhood U \u2286 S of x, the Poincar\u00e9 map on Poincar\u00e9 section S is a map P : U \u2192 S, x (cid:55)\u2192 \u03a6x(ts) where ts is the time between the two intersections, satisfying 1. 2. P(U) is a neighborhood of x and P : U \u2192 P(U) is a diffeomorphism; For every point x in U, the positive semi-orbit of x intersects S for the \ufb01rst time at P(x). Appendix F.7. Bifurcation Since the \ufb02ow of a dynamical system in its phase space is a function of its parameters, the topological structure of the trajectories (including attractor sets) in phase space changes as the parameters change. To see how the topological structure changes with system parameters, we study the bifurcation map of the system. De\ufb01nition A8 (Bifurcation). A bifurcation occurs when a small smooth change in a system parameter value causes an abrupt change in the topological structure of the trajectory in phase space. A bifurcation diagram is a visualization of the system\u2019s parameter space showing the number and behavior of attractor sets for each parameter con\ufb01guration. At a bifurcation point, the system stability may change as the topological structure splits or merges, such as the periodic doubling or halving of a limit cycle. References 1. 2. 3. 4. Cveticanin, L.

To study vocal fold behaviors, we are particularly interested in those attractors revealing the periodic motion of the \ufb02ow in phase space. Such attractors include the limit cycle or the limit torus, which are isolated periodic or toroidal orbits, respectively. Some attractor sets have a fractal structure resultant from a chaotic state of the dynamical system [20,54], and are called strange attractors. Figure A1. Illustration of different attractors in a dynamical system. Appendix F.4. Chaos and Exponential Divergence of Phase Space Trajectories Chaos is a characteristic state of a nonlinear dynamical system. There are different de\ufb01nitions of chaos. A simple one is as follows: De\ufb01nition A5 (Chaos). Equip a distance metric d on the phase space M. Then C \u2208 M is referred to as a chaotic set of \u03a6 if, for any x, y \u2208 C, x (cid:54)= y, we have n\u2192\u221e inf d(\u03a6n(x), \u03a6n(y)) = 0 lim n\u2192\u221e sup d(\u03a6n(x), \u03a6n(y)) > 0 lim Thus, by de\ufb01nition, chaos is a state characterized by extreme sensitivity to initial conditions (trajectories starting from any two arbitrarily close initial conditions diverge exponentially). The Lypunov exponent is used to quantify this divergence. It also measures the measures the sensitivity of the evolution of the dynamical system to initial conditions. 36 of 39 (A152) (A153) Entropy 2023, 25, 1039 Appendix F.5. Stability Attractor sets (of all types) also characterize the stability of dynamical systems. De\ufb01nition A6 (Stability). A compact \u03a6-invariant subset A = \u03a6(A) \u2286 M is called a Lyapunov stable attraction set if 1. 2. It has an open basin of attraction B(A); The Lyapunov stability condition is satis\ufb01ed: every neighborhood U of A contains a smaller neighborhood V such that every iterative forward image \u03a6n(V) is contained in U. Appendix F.6. Poincar\u00e9 Map and Poincar\u00e9 Section To study the trajectory (or orbit) structure of dynamical systems, we use the Poincar\u00e9 map or Poincar\u00e9 section. De\ufb01nition A7 (Poincar\u00e9 map [53]). For an n-dimensional phase space with a periodic orbit \u03b3x, a Poincar\u00e9 section S is an (n \u2212 1)-dimensional section (hyper-plane) that is transverse to \u03b3x. Given an open, connected neighborhood U \u2286 S of x, the Poincar\u00e9 map on Poincar\u00e9 section S is a map P : U \u2192 S, x (cid:55)\u2192 \u03a6x(ts) where ts is the time between the two intersections, satisfying 1. 2. P(U) is a neighborhood of x and P : U \u2192 P(U) is a diffeomorphism; For every point x in U, the positive semi-orbit of x intersects S for the \ufb01rst time at P(x). Appendix F.7. Bifurcation Since the \ufb02ow of a dynamical system in its phase space is a function of its parameters, the topological structure of the trajectories (including attractor sets) in phase space changes as the parameters change. To see how the topological structure changes with system parameters, we study the bifurcation map of the system. De\ufb01nition A8 (Bifurcation). A bifurcation occurs when a small smooth change in a system parameter value causes an abrupt change in the topological structure of the trajectory in phase space. A bifurcation diagram is a visualization of the system\u2019s parameter space showing the number and behavior of attractor sets for each parameter con\ufb01guration. At a bifurcation point, the system stability may change as the topological structure splits or merges, such as the periodic doubling or halving of a limit cycle. References 1. 2. 3. 4. Cveticanin, L.
