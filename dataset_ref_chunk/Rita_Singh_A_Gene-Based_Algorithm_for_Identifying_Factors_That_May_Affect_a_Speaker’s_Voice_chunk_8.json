In order to quantify these differences, we modeled the distributions of chainlink counts and chainlink connectivities for the different severity levels. These distributions have the general characteristics of over-dispersed Poisson distributions and can be modelled as Conway\u2013Maxwell\u2013Poisson (CMP) distributions [67]. The CMP distribution is a two- parameter exponential-family PMF over non-negative integers that takes the form P(n) = \u03bbn (n!)\u03bd 1 Z(\u03bb, \u03bd) where \u03bb, \u03bd > 0 are the parameters of the distribution. Given a set of integers, \u03bb and \u03bd can be obtained through a maximum likelihood estimator [68]. Figure 4 shows the maximum likelihood estimates of the probability distributions of chainlink counts (Figure 4a) and connectivities (Figure 4b) for syndromes associated with speech problems of different severity levels. These, too, follow the visible trends of Figure 3, where the distributions of both chainlink counts and chainlink connectivities for syndromes associated with the two extreme conditions, normal and absent speech, are distinct from those for other types of problems. To quantify the differences in the distributions, we de\ufb01ne the code distance between two sets of integers Ci = {n1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ni} and Cj = {m1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , mj} as the excess number of bits required to encode them if each set is encoded using the optimal code for the other set rather than itself. D(Pi, Pj) = \u2211 n\u2208Ci log2 (cid:18) Pj(n) Pi(n) (cid:19) + \u2211 n\u2208Cj log2 (cid:32) Pi(n) Pj(n) (cid:33) where Pi() and Pj() are the estimates of the PMFs for Ci and Cj, respectively. In our case, we choose the maximum likelihood estimates of the CMP distributions for the sets to compute this metric. Table 3a shows the code distances between the chainlink counts for different types of speech problems. Table 3b shows the same for their chainlink connectivities. In both cases, we observe that the distributions for normal speech stand clearly apart from those for the other types of speech problems. The distributions for fully absent speech, too, are distinctive from those for other problem types.

In order to quantify these differences, we modeled the distributions of chainlink counts and chainlink connectivities for the different severity levels. These distributions have the general characteristics of over-dispersed Poisson distributions and can be modelled as Conway\u2013Maxwell\u2013Poisson (CMP) distributions [67]. The CMP distribution is a two- parameter exponential-family PMF over non-negative integers that takes the form P(n) = \u03bbn (n!)\u03bd 1 Z(\u03bb, \u03bd) where \u03bb, \u03bd > 0 are the parameters of the distribution. Given a set of integers, \u03bb and \u03bd can be obtained through a maximum likelihood estimator [68]. Figure 4 shows the maximum likelihood estimates of the probability distributions of chainlink counts (Figure 4a) and connectivities (Figure 4b) for syndromes associated with speech problems of different severity levels. These, too, follow the visible trends of Figure 3, where the distributions of both chainlink counts and chainlink connectivities for syndromes associated with the two extreme conditions, normal and absent speech, are distinct from those for other types of problems. To quantify the differences in the distributions, we de\ufb01ne the code distance between two sets of integers Ci = {n1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ni} and Cj = {m1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , mj} as the excess number of bits required to encode them if each set is encoded using the optimal code for the other set rather than itself. D(Pi, Pj) = \u2211 n\u2208Ci log2 (cid:18) Pj(n) Pi(n) (cid:19) + \u2211 n\u2208Cj log2 (cid:32) Pi(n) Pj(n) (cid:33) where Pi() and Pj() are the estimates of the PMFs for Ci and Cj, respectively. In our case, we choose the maximum likelihood estimates of the CMP distributions for the sets to compute this metric. Table 3a shows the code distances between the chainlink counts for different types of speech problems. Table 3b shows the same for their chainlink connectivities.

The CMP distribution is a two- parameter exponential-family PMF over non-negative integers that takes the form P(n) = \u03bbn (n!)\u03bd 1 Z(\u03bb, \u03bd) where \u03bb, \u03bd > 0 are the parameters of the distribution. Given a set of integers, \u03bb and \u03bd can be obtained through a maximum likelihood estimator [68]. Figure 4 shows the maximum likelihood estimates of the probability distributions of chainlink counts (Figure 4a) and connectivities (Figure 4b) for syndromes associated with speech problems of different severity levels. These, too, follow the visible trends of Figure 3, where the distributions of both chainlink counts and chainlink connectivities for syndromes associated with the two extreme conditions, normal and absent speech, are distinct from those for other types of problems. To quantify the differences in the distributions, we de\ufb01ne the code distance between two sets of integers Ci = {n1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ni} and Cj = {m1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , mj} as the excess number of bits required to encode them if each set is encoded using the optimal code for the other set rather than itself. D(Pi, Pj) = \u2211 n\u2208Ci log2 (cid:18) Pj(n) Pi(n) (cid:19) + \u2211 n\u2208Cj log2 (cid:32) Pi(n) Pj(n) (cid:33) where Pi() and Pj() are the estimates of the PMFs for Ci and Cj, respectively. In our case, we choose the maximum likelihood estimates of the CMP distributions for the sets to compute this metric. Table 3a shows the code distances between the chainlink counts for different types of speech problems. Table 3b shows the same for their chainlink connectivities. In both cases, we observe that the distributions for normal speech stand clearly apart from those for the other types of speech problems. The distributions for fully absent speech, too, are distinctive from those for other problem types. Among apraxic, dysarthric, impaired, and 14 of 33 (2) (3) Entropy 2023, 25, 897 delayed speech, the differences between the distributions of adjacent degrees of severity is minimal; however, the distances show a distinct increasing trend with increases in the degree of impairment. 101Dysarthric 050100150200250 050100150200250 101Impaired 050100150200250 101Delayed 050100150200250 101Absent 05001000150020002500 101Normal 050100150200250 101Apraxic 050100150200250 (a) 101Delayed 05001000150020002500 101Absent 101Apraxic 05001000150020002500 101Normal 05001000150020002500 101Dysarthric 05001000150020002500 101Impaired 05001000150020002500 (b) 02040Impaired 050100150200250 050100150200250 050100150200250 050100150200250 050100150200250 050100150200250 02040Absent 02040Normal 02040Dysarthric 02040Apraxic 02040Delayed (c) Figure 3.

Our analysis has considered the chainlink counts and connectivities indpendently, and each of them shows this behavior. A joint analysis of both may show stronger dependencies. Most importantly, note that in all of the analysis above, we have ignored the secondary effects of other issues, such as intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies, a highly simplifying assumption. A more correct information measure that takes these into account is expected to show even stronger relationships between the level and degree of connectivity of a syndrome to the FOXP2 pathway and its effect on speech. 4.3. Why Are There No Instances of Missing Voice Chains? Are voice chains redundant? The fact that there are no missing voice chains is easily explainable. The reason is linked to the size of the syndromic regions. To understand this, consider the following facts. Our database comprises 4319 unique pathways. A total of 1205 of these pathways are linked to the pathway that carries the FOXP2 gene, and collectively, these include 11,746 genes. Thus, a randomly chosen gene from the entire human genome of 42.7k genes (as in the HGNC Human Genome database) has a 27.5% chance of being on a pathway that links to the FOXP2 containing pathway, i.e., of being a level-2 chainlink gene. Entropy 2023, 25, 897 The shortest microdeletion considered (2q23.1) includes 9 genes, each of which has a 27% chance of being a level-2 chainlink gene. The syndrome itself then has a 94.44% probability of having a level-2 voice chain purely by chance. The second shortest pathway includes 26 genes and has a 99.98% probability of having a level-2 voice chain by"}
