Clearly, the tensile strength values of S1-S6 decreased after the strand fracture occurred at the corrosion end. This further proves that effective prestress may decrease after the secondary transfer. The effective prestress of S1 at the non-corrosion end decreases by 62.5 kN, showing a loss ratio of 12.6%. It decreases by 86.6 kN in S3, showing a loss ratio of 19.2%. It decreases by 40.2 kN in S4, showing a loss ratio of 7.9%. From the above analysis results, it can be seen that the strength of the concrete has a great in\ufb02uence on the prestress loss. This is mainly due to the fact that concrete with a lower elastic modulus will produce a larger compressive strain under the action of the released anchorage force at the corroded end. This change also leads to larger tensile strains in the anchorage with a larger elastic modulus and the 7 of 19 Metals 2023, 13, 1489 steel strand according to the principle of displacement coordination, ultimately resulting in a reduction in the effective prestress at the uncorroded end. Figure 7. Tensile force of rope meters of S1\u2013S6. All test parameters of S1 and S2 were the same except for the length of component. It can be seen from Figure 8 that effective prestress at the non-corrosion end decreases by 62.5 kN in S1 and 36.3 kN in S2, showing a loss ratio of 7.1%. With the increase in the length of the component, the sphere of in\ufb02uence of the secondary transfer on the concrete at the non-corrosion side decreases. Hence, a smaller relative displacement is generated between the concrete at the non-corrosion side and the anchorage device, thus resulting in a smaller prestress loss. Figure 8. Overall structural model. All test parameters of S1, S5, and S6 were the same, except for the stirrup diameter. It can be seen from Figure 8 that the effective prestress at the non-corrosion end decreases by 62.5 kN in S1 and 55.5 kN in S5, showing a loss ratio of 11.1%. The effective prestress at the non-corrosion end decreases by 51.9 kN in S6, showing a loss ratio of 10.3%. The stirrup reinforcement ratio has no obvious in\ufb02uence on prestress loss. This is because the concrete generally does not develop splitting failure due to the large cross-section size of the specimens in the experiment. The horizontal constraint of the stirrups against the steel wire strand has not been completely developed. Hence, the stirrup reinforcement ratio has a small in\ufb02uence on the effective prestress. 8 of 19 Metals 2023, 13, 1489 Obviously, the effective prestress decreases after the secondary transfer of residual prestress due to the fracture of the steel wire strand. When the length of the specimens is suf\ufb01cient, the effective prestress value is relatively sensitive to concrete strength. When the thickness of the concrete protective cover exceeds \ufb01ve times the diameter of the steel wire strand, the stirrup con\ufb01guration has small in\ufb02uences on the effective prestress of the secondary transfer if the component has no splitting failure. 4. Calculation Method of Secondary Transfer Length Since the secondary transfer after the fracture of the post-tensioning steel wire strand is similar to that of the pre-tensioning steel wire strand, the steel strand will shrink and slip. As a result, prestress is transferred through bonding slippage between the concrete and the steel strand.

According to the research results [29], the relationship between the average bond stress ((cid:101)\u03c4) and the maximum bond stress (\u03c4(cid:48) max) in the secondary transfer length of residual prestress is: \u03c4(cid:48) max (cid:101)\u03c4 = 1.25 where \u03c4(cid:48) max is the maximum bond stress in the transfer length and (cid:101)\u03c4 is the average bond stress in the transfer length. It is worth noting that the shear stress is assumed to be uniformly distributed along the longitudinal direction of the prestressed reinforcement in order to simplify the calculation.

Process Stress Analysis and Calculation of Secondary Transfer Length According to the equation of equilibrium of forces, there is an equilibrium equation between the bond force in the transfer length and the actual prestress at the beginning of corrosion of the steel wire strand: (cid:101)\u03c4 \u2211 s lt = \u03c3p Ap Bringing Equations (1) and (2) into Equation (3), one obtains: lt = \u03c3p Apn0.64 1.68 \u00d7 (cid:112) fc \u00d7 \u2211s where \u2211s is the perimeter of the steel wire strand, lt is the transfer length, \u03c3p is the actual effective tensile strength of the steel wire strand before corrosion, and Ap is the area of the steel wire strand. 9 of 19 (1) (2) (3) (4) Metals 2023, 13, 1489 Specimen No. S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 10 of 19 According to regulations [12], the prestress transfer length of a 1 \u00d7 7 steel wire strand was calculated according to the following equation: lt = 0.17 \u03c3p f (cid:48) t d (5) where f (cid:48) diameter of a single-wire strand. t is the tensile strength of concrete and f (cid:48) t = 0.26 f 2/3 cu , and where d is the nominal The secondary transfer lengths of prestress of S1\u2013S6 were calculated according to Equations (4) and (5).

Clearly, the tensile strength values of S1-S6 decreased after the strand fracture occurred at the corrosion end. This further proves that effective prestress may decrease after the secondary transfer. The effective prestress of S1 at the non-corrosion end decreases by 62.5 kN, showing a loss ratio of 12.6%. It decreases by 86.6 kN in S3, showing a loss ratio of 19.2%. It decreases by 40.2 kN in S4, showing a loss ratio of 7.9%. From the above analysis results, it can be seen that the strength of the concrete has a great in\ufb02uence on the prestress loss.

Hence, a smaller relative displacement is generated between the concrete at the non-corrosion side and the anchorage device, thus resulting in a smaller prestress loss. Figure 8. Overall structural model. All test parameters of S1, S5, and S6 were the same, except for the stirrup diameter. It can be seen from Figure 8 that the effective prestress at the non-corrosion end decreases by 62.5 kN in S1 and 55.5 kN in S5, showing a loss ratio of 11.1%. The effective prestress at the non-corrosion end decreases by 51.9 kN in S6, showing a loss ratio of 10.3%. The stirrup reinforcement ratio has no obvious in\ufb02uence on prestress loss. This is because the concrete generally does not develop splitting failure due to the large cross-section size of the specimens in the experiment. The horizontal constraint of the stirrups against the steel wire strand has not been completely developed. Hence, the stirrup reinforcement ratio has a small in\ufb02uence on the effective prestress. 8 of 19 Metals 2023, 13, 1489 Obviously, the effective prestress decreases after the secondary transfer of residual prestress due to the fracture of the steel wire strand. When the length of the specimens is suf\ufb01cient, the effective prestress value is relatively sensitive to concrete strength. When the thickness of the concrete protective cover exceeds \ufb01ve times the diameter of the steel wire strand, the stirrup con\ufb01guration has small in\ufb02uences on the effective prestress of the secondary transfer if the component has no splitting failure. 4. Calculation Method of Secondary Transfer Length Since the secondary transfer after the fracture of the post-tensioning steel wire strand is similar to that of the pre-tensioning steel wire strand, the steel strand will shrink and slip. As a result, prestress is transferred through bonding slippage between the concrete and the steel strand. According to the de\ufb01nition of pre-tensioning transfer length, the secondary transfer length can be de\ufb01ned as the distance at which the steel wire strand stress increases from 0 to effective prestress after fracture. 4.1. Basic Hypotheses (1) The thickness of the protective cover of the steel wire strand component is high enough, and the in\ufb02uences of initial prestressed cracks are ignored. (2) The bond stress is equal in the transfer length range. According to the research results [29], the relationship between the average bond stress ((cid:101)\u03c4) and the maximum bond stress (\u03c4(cid:48) max) in the secondary transfer length of residual prestress is: \u03c4(cid:48) max (cid:101)\u03c4 = 1.25 where \u03c4(cid:48) max is the maximum bond stress in the transfer length and (cid:101)\u03c4 is the average bond stress in the transfer length. It is worth noting that the shear stress is assumed to be uniformly distributed along the longitudinal direction of the prestressed reinforcement in order to simplify the calculation. (3) According to [30], the maximum bond stress of the steel wire strand is: \u03c4(cid:48) max = 2.1 \u00d7 (cid:112) fc n0.64 where fc is the concrete compressive strength and fc = 0.76 fcu, and where n refers to the number of wires in the strand. (4) The corrugated pipe has good bonding with concrete, showing coordinated and consistent deformation. 4.2. Process Stress Analysis and Calculation of Secondary Transfer Length According to the equation of equilibrium of forces, there is an equilibrium equation between the bond force in the transfer length and the actual prestress at the beginning of corrosion of the steel wire strand: (cid:101)\u03c4 \u2211 s lt = \u03c3p Ap Bringing Equations (1) and (2) into Equation (3), one obtains: lt = \u03c3p Apn0.64 1.68 \u00d7 (cid:112) fc \u00d7 \u2211s where \u2211s is the perimeter of the steel wire strand, lt is the transfer length, \u03c3p is the actual effective tensile strength of the steel wire strand before corrosion, and Ap is the area of the steel wire strand. 9 of 19 (1) (2) (3) (4) Metals 2023, 13, 1489 Specimen No. S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 10 of 19 According to regulations [12], the prestress transfer length of a 1 \u00d7 7 steel wire strand was calculated according to the following equation: lt = 0.17 \u03c3p f (cid:48) t d (5) where f (cid:48) diameter of a single-wire strand. t is the tensile strength of concrete and f (cid:48) t = 0.26 f 2/3 cu , and where d is the nominal The secondary transfer lengths of prestress of S1\u2013S6 were calculated according to Equations (4) and (5). The results"}], "doc_text": "the corrosion fracture of the steel wire strand are shown in Figure 7. Clearly, the tensile strength values of S1-S6 decreased after the strand fracture occurred at the corrosion end. This further proves that effective prestress may decrease after the secondary transfer. The effective prestress of S1 at the non-corrosion end decreases by 62.5 kN, showing a loss ratio of 12.6%. It decreases by 86.6 kN in S3, showing a loss ratio of 19.2%. It decreases by 40.2 kN in S4, showing a loss ratio of 7.9%. From the above analysis results, it can be seen that the strength of the concrete has a great in\ufb02uence on the prestress loss. This is mainly due to the fact that concrete with a lower elastic modulus will produce a larger compressive strain under the action of the released anchorage force at the corroded end. This change also leads to larger tensile strains in the anchorage with a larger elastic modulus and the 7 of 19 Metals 2023, 13, 1489 steel strand according to the principle of displacement coordination, ultimately resulting in a reduction in the effective prestress at the uncorroded end.
