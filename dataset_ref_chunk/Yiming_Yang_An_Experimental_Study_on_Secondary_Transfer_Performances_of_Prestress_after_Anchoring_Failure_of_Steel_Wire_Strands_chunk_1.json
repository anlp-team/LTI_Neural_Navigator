One-side fast corrosion was applied to the steel wire strand components using the electrochemical method until anchoring failure was reached. The sphere of in\ufb02uence, stress changes, and the retraction and swelling effect of broken beams after failure were investigated. The in\ufb02uences of factors such as concrete strength, stirrup area, and the length of the component on the secondary transfer length of residual prestress were discussed. Based on the deformation relationship between prestressed steel wire strands and concrete in the stress transfer zone, a stress equation was established and solved through a bond constitutive model. A prediction model of the effective stress transfer length of prestressed steel wire strand after failure was proposed. The results demonstrated that residual prestress can have a secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of end-anchored steel wire strands, but some effective prestress may be lost. Moreover, the loss of prestress is inversely proportional to concrete compressive strength. When the specimens are relatively short, the prestress loss increases signi\ufb01cantly. Concrete strength has signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uences on the length of secondary transfer. The proposed simpli\ufb01ed calculation method of the secondary transfer length of residual prestress has a relatively high accuracy, with an average error of 2.9% and a maximum error of 5.2%.

The effective transfer of prestress to concrete is the basic condition for the normal operation of prestressed structures. In general, the post-tensioned members complete the transfer of prestress through the anchorage and the plate under the anchorage, while the pre-tensioned members complete the transfer of prestress through the bond between the prestressed reinforcement and the concrete [5]. The length from the end surface of prestressed tendons with zero stress to the end surface with effective prestress in the pre-tensioning components is called the transfer length of the prestressed tendons [6]. Hence, there are two key factors that in\ufb02uence the transfer length of prestress. One is the bond force, and the other is the Hoyer effect [7,8].

Moreover, the calculation formula of transfer length has been provided in the standards of many countries [9\u201312]. Some scholars have carried out experimental and theoretical studies on prestress length and compared their results with the transfer length determined by the standard calculation method. They believe that the calculation of prestress transfer length in standards is too conservative and safe [13\u201315]. Some scholars have studied key factors that in\ufb02uence transfer length, and they believe that factors such as concrete strength, corrosion, the concrete cover, and circumferential constraints as well as the shape and diameter of rebars can in\ufb02uence the prestress transfer length [16\u201318]. Among the above factors, concrete strength is accepted as a main in\ufb02uencing factor of transfer length. A higher concrete strength is accompanied by a lower bond length. However, some studies believe that when the concrete strength is higher than 55 MPa, the bond length may not decrease with the increase in concrete strength [19,20]. Moreover, the transfer length increases with the increase in the corrosion rate of prestressed tendons. The provision of a circumferentially constrained spring-loop around the strand can signi\ufb01cantly shorten the prestressed transfer length (an approximately 45% reduction) and can effectively improve the stress condition of the beams [21]. When the concrete cover is less than 5.5 times the diameter of the steel strand, the smaller cover thickness will result in a longer transfer length. However, when the concrete cover exceeds 5.5 times the diameter of the steel strand, it becomes challenging for the prestressed steel strand to undergo splitting failure during the transfer process. In this case, further increasing the cover thickness has a less signi\ufb01cant impact on the transfer length [19]. Hence, the transfer length is not obviously in\ufb02uenced if the thickness of the concrete protective cover continues to increase [22]. Moreover, the prestress transfer length increases with the increase in the corrosion rate [23]. Nevertheless, existing studies are mainly based on pre-tensioning components.

Among the above factors, concrete strength is accepted as a main in\ufb02uencing factor of transfer length. A higher concrete strength is accompanied by a lower bond length. However, some studies believe that when the concrete strength is higher than 55 MPa, the bond length may not decrease with the increase in concrete strength [19,20]. Moreover, the transfer length increases with the increase in the corrosion rate of prestressed tendons. The provision of a circumferentially constrained spring-loop around the strand can signi\ufb01cantly shorten the prestressed transfer length (an approximately 45% reduction) and can effectively improve the stress condition of the beams [21]. When the concrete cover is less than 5.5 times the diameter of the steel strand, the smaller cover thickness will result in a longer transfer length. However, when the concrete cover exceeds 5.5 times the diameter of the steel strand, it becomes challenging for the prestressed steel strand to undergo splitting failure during the transfer process. In this case, further increasing the cover thickness has a less signi\ufb01cant impact on the transfer length [19]. Hence, the transfer length is not obviously in\ufb02uenced if the thickness of the concrete protective cover continues to increase [22]. Moreover, the prestress transfer length increases with the increase in the corrosion rate [23]. Nevertheless, existing studies are mainly based on pre-tensioning components.

One-side fast corrosion was applied to the steel wire strand components using the electrochemical method until anchoring failure was reached.

The in\ufb02uences of factors such as concrete strength, stirrup area, and the length of the component on the secondary transfer length of residual prestress were discussed. Based on the deformation relationship between prestressed steel wire strands and concrete in the stress transfer zone, a stress equation was established and solved through a bond constitutive model. A prediction model of the effective stress transfer length of prestressed steel wire strand after failure was proposed. The results demonstrated that residual prestress can have a secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of end-anchored steel wire strands, but some effective prestress may be lost.

Moreover, the calculation formula of transfer length has been provided in the standards of many countries [9\u201312]. Some scholars have carried out experimental and theoretical studies on prestress length and compared their results with the transfer length determined by the standard calculation method. They believe that the calculation of prestress transfer length in standards is too conservative and safe [13\u201315]. Some scholars have studied key factors that in\ufb02uence transfer length, and they believe that factors such as concrete strength, corrosion, the concrete cover, and circumferential constraints as well as the shape and diameter of rebars can in\ufb02uence the prestress transfer length [16\u201318]. Among the above factors, concrete strength is accepted as a main in\ufb02uencing factor of transfer length. A higher concrete strength is accompanied by a lower bond length. However, some studies believe that when the concrete strength is higher than 55 MPa, the bond length may not decrease with the increase in concrete strength [19,20]. Moreover, the transfer length increases with the increase in the corrosion rate of prestressed tendons. The provision of a circumferentially constrained spring-loop around the strand can signi\ufb01cantly shorten the prestressed transfer length (an approximately 45% reduction) and can effectively improve the stress condition of the beams [21]. When the concrete cover is less than 5.5 times the diameter of the steel strand, the smaller cover thickness will result in a longer transfer length. However, when the concrete cover exceeds 5.5 times the diameter of the steel strand, it becomes challenging for the prestressed steel strand to undergo splitting failure during the transfer process. In this case, further increasing the cover thickness has a less signi\ufb01cant impact on the transfer length [19]. Hence, the transfer length is not obviously in\ufb02uenced if the thickness of the concrete protective cover continues to increase [22].

One-side fast corrosion was applied to the steel wire strand components using the electrochemical method until anchoring failure was reached. The sphere of in\ufb02uence, stress changes, and the retraction and swelling effect of broken beams after failure were investigated. The in\ufb02uences of factors such as concrete strength, stirrup area, and the length of the component on the secondary transfer length of residual prestress were discussed. Based on the deformation relationship between prestressed steel wire strands and concrete in the stress transfer zone, a stress equation was established and solved through a bond constitutive model. A prediction model of the effective stress transfer length of prestressed steel wire strand after failure was proposed. The results demonstrated that residual prestress can have a secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of end-anchored steel wire strands, but some effective prestress may be lost. Moreover, the loss of prestress is inversely proportional to concrete compressive strength. When the specimens are relatively short, the prestress loss increases signi\ufb01cantly. Concrete strength has signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uences on the length of secondary transfer. The proposed simpli\ufb01ed calculation method of the secondary transfer length of residual prestress has a relatively high accuracy, with an average error of 2.9% and a maximum error of 5.2%.
