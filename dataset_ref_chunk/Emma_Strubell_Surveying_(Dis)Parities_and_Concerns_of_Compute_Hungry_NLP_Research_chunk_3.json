We further asked respon- dents to share their geographic location (\ud835\udc443). Over- all, 45.8% of responses came from the Americas (AM), 40.4% from Europe (EU) and the Middle East (ME), and 13.8% from Asia (AS) and Australia (Aus).

For each section, we first provide an overview of the distribution in the responses and then provide a fine- grained analysis with respect to the seniority and job sector. The goal of the fine-grained analysis is to investigate if we can observe any statistically significant differences across different groups. Statistical tests. Due to the explorative nature of our survey, the collected data violates the necessary conditions on homoscedasticity (Levene, 1960) and normality (Shaphiro and Wilk, 1965) that are re- quired to conduct an analysis of variances (ANOVA, Fisher 1921). Instead, we perform a Kruskal-Wallis test (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952) as an indicator for any statistically significant differences2 and if so, perform pairwise Welch\u2019s t-tests (Welch, 1951) against a Bonferroni corrected \ud835\udefc = 0.05 where \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc5a is the number of pairwise comparisons; i.e., for \ud835\udc5b 2This is the case when \ud835\udc3b > \ud835\udc3b \ud835\udc5b 0 for \ud835\udc5b 0 = 9.488 (job sector) and with \ud835\udc3b \ud835\udc5b 0 \u223c \ud835\udf12 2 \ud835\udc5b\u22121 groups. For \ud835\udefc = 0.05, we get \ud835\udc3b 5 \ud835\udc3b 4 0 = 7.815 (seniority) (Abramowitz, 1974). groups, \ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5b\u22c5(\ud835\udc5b\u22121) (Bonferroni, 1936). This re- sults in corrected \ud835\udefc = 0.0083 for seniority with \ud835\udc5b = 4 and \ud835\udefc = 0.005 for the job sector with \ud835\udc5b = 5 (not merging academia and industry sectors). For the numerical questions (\ud835\udc444 and \ud835\udc4411), we further analyze if there exist disparities within each group, using interquartile ranges with \ud835\udc58 = 1.5 to detect outliers (Tukey, 1977). 2 3 Environmental Footprint We quantified existing concerns about the environ- mental impact of NLP experiments using a five point Likert scale (\ud835\udc447) and asked our participants to select the most pressing issue in the typical life cycle of an NLP model (\ud835\udc448) between (Train)ing, model (Select)tion, and (Infer)ence. Participants were allowed to select all applicable answers and could select (None) or provide (Other) pressing is- sues. They could also provide a textual justification of their answer(s) (\ud835\udc449). 3.1 Analysis Figure 3a shows that more than 50% of our partici- pants were moderately (28.2%) or very (27.9%) con- cerned about the environmental footprint of NLP, while around 33% of them were slightly (14.7%) or somewhat (18.6%) concerned. 10.6% of par- ticipants were not concerned at all. Our partic- ipants further agreed that training (75.3%) and model selection (59.9%) are the most pressing is- sues (Fig. 3b).3 Inference took third place with 20.2%, while 6.1% of our participants selected none. The smallest number responses was given for other with hyperparameter tuning and travelling (6 men- tions each) being the most frequent ones. Also men- tioned were storage consumption, hardware, expec- tations about large data experiments, and scale. In- terestingly, many respondents considered inference less pressing than training and model selection. Job Sector. Although we do not find significant differences by seniority, we see larger (although not statistically significant) differences when look- ing at the responses grouped by researchers from different job sectors (Fig. 4a). We find that respon- dents from the large industry sector were mostly somewhat concerned, while the median for all other groups lies at often concerned. Similarly, we also see larger differences in the most pressing issues 3Note that 39.7% of our participants selected exactly these two as the only pressing factors.

For instance, small and large industries were substantially more concerned with respect to inference and much less concerned with respect to model selection than academia. 3.2 Discussion and Recommendations An analysis of the 81 (26%) free-text responses (\ud835\udc449) reveals diverse opinions about the environmental impact of NLP and the reasons behind the most pressing factors. For instance, among respondents that stated to be not at all concerned about NLP\u2019s environmental footprint, a majority considered the impact of NLP research on climate change to be negligible compared to other factors.

An- other argument brought up multiple times in this group of respondents is that the ACL is not the right institution to tackle challenges of climate change. Some responses alternatively suggested to push for regulatory changes, since big tech companies might not be affected by decisions made by the ACL. Regarding the most pressing factors, one of the main arguments provided for inference was that in- dustry spends most time on inference, hence it is the most expensive one.

For each section, we first provide an overview of the distribution in the responses and then provide a fine- grained analysis with respect to the seniority and job sector. The goal of the fine-grained analysis is to investigate if we can observe any statistically significant differences across different groups. Statistical tests. Due to the explorative nature of our survey, the collected data violates the necessary conditions on homoscedasticity (Levene, 1960) and normality (Shaphiro and Wilk, 1965) that are re- quired to conduct an analysis of variances (ANOVA, Fisher 1921). Instead, we perform a Kruskal-Wallis test (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952) as an indicator for any statistically significant differences2 and if so, perform pairwise Welch\u2019s t-tests (Welch, 1951) against a Bonferroni corrected \ud835\udefc = 0.05 where \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc5a is the number of pairwise comparisons; i.e., for \ud835\udc5b 2This is the case when \ud835\udc3b > \ud835\udc3b \ud835\udc5b 0 for \ud835\udc5b 0 = 9.488 (job sector) and with \ud835\udc3b \ud835\udc5b 0 \u223c \ud835\udf12 2 \ud835\udc5b\u22121 groups. For \ud835\udefc = 0.05, we get \ud835\udc3b 5 \ud835\udc3b 4 0 = 7.815 (seniority) (Abramowitz, 1974). groups, \ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5b\u22c5(\ud835\udc5b\u22121) (Bonferroni, 1936). This re- sults in corrected \ud835\udefc = 0.0083 for seniority with \ud835\udc5b = 4 and \ud835\udefc = 0.005 for the job sector with \ud835\udc5b = 5 (not merging academia and industry sectors). For the numerical questions (\ud835\udc444 and \ud835\udc4411), we further analyze if there exist disparities within each group, using interquartile ranges with \ud835\udc58 = 1.5 to detect outliers (Tukey, 1977). 2 3 Environmental Footprint We quantified existing concerns about the environ- mental impact of NLP experiments using a five point Likert scale (\ud835\udc447) and asked our participants to select the most pressing issue in the typical life cycle of an NLP model (\ud835\udc448) between (Train)ing, model (Select)tion, and (Infer)ence. Participants were allowed to select all applicable answers and could select (None) or provide (Other) pressing is- sues. They could also provide a textual justification of their answer(s) (\ud835\udc449). 3.1 Analysis Figure 3a shows that more than 50% of our partici- pants were moderately (28.2%) or very (27.9%) con- cerned about the environmental footprint of NLP, while around 33% of them were slightly (14.7%) or somewhat (18.6%) concerned. 10.6% of par- ticipants were not concerned at all. Our partic- ipants further agreed that training (75.3%) and model selection (59.9%) are the most pressing is- sues (Fig. 3b).3 Inference took third place with 20.2%, while 6.1% of our participants selected none. The smallest number responses was given for other with hyperparameter tuning and travelling (6 men- tions each) being the most frequent ones. Also men- tioned were storage consumption, hardware, expec- tations about large data experiments, and scale. In- terestingly, many respondents considered inference less pressing than training and model selection. Job Sector. Although we do not find significant differences by seniority, we see larger (although not statistically significant) differences when look- ing at the responses grouped by researchers from different job sectors (Fig. 4a). We find that respon- dents from the large industry sector were mostly somewhat concerned, while the median for all other groups lies at often concerned. Similarly, we also see larger differences in the most pressing issues 3Note that 39.7% of our participants selected exactly these two as the only pressing factors.

For instance, small and large industries were substantially more concerned with respect to inference and much less concerned with respect to model selection than academia. 3.2 Discussion and Recommendations An analysis of the 81 (26%) free-text responses (\ud835\udc449) reveals diverse opinions about the environmental impact of NLP and the reasons behind the most pressing factors. For instance, among respondents that stated to be not at all concerned about NLP\u2019s environmental footprint, a majority considered the impact of NLP research on climate change to be negligible compared to other factors. Factors men- tioned as being more relevant to climate change include air travel (also mentioned twice in the gen- eral responses \ud835\udc4419), cars, and more cost intensive computations from other areas (of science). An- other argument brought up multiple times in this group of respondents is that the ACL is not the right institution to tackle challenges of climate change. Some responses alternatively suggested to push for regulatory changes, since big tech companies might not be affected by decisions made by the ACL. Regarding the most pressing factors, one of the main arguments provided for inference was that in- dustry spends most time on inference, hence it is the most expensive one.

Instead, we perform a Kruskal-Wallis test (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952) as an indicator for any statistically significant differences2 and if so, perform pairwise Welch\u2019s t-tests (Welch, 1951) against a Bonferroni corrected \ud835\udefc = 0.05 where \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc5a is the number of pairwise comparisons; i.e., for \ud835\udc5b 2This is the case when \ud835\udc3b > \ud835\udc3b \ud835\udc5b 0 for \ud835\udc5b 0 = 9.488 (job sector) and with \ud835\udc3b \ud835\udc5b 0 \u223c \ud835\udf12 2 \ud835\udc5b\u22121 groups. For \ud835\udefc = 0.05, we get \ud835\udc3b 5 \ud835\udc3b 4 0 = 7.815 (seniority) (Abramowitz, 1974). groups, \ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5b\u22c5(\ud835\udc5b\u22121) (Bonferroni, 1936). This re- sults in corrected \ud835\udefc = 0.0083 for seniority with \ud835\udc5b = 4 and \ud835\udefc = 0.005 for the job sector with \ud835\udc5b = 5 (not merging academia and industry sectors). For the numerical questions (\ud835\udc444 and \ud835\udc4411), we further analyze if there exist disparities within each group, using interquartile ranges with \ud835\udc58 = 1.5 to detect outliers (Tukey, 1977). 2 3 Environmental Footprint We quantified existing concerns about the environ- mental impact of NLP experiments using a five point Likert scale (\ud835\udc447) and asked our participants to select the most pressing issue in the typical life cycle of an NLP model (\ud835\udc448) between (Train)ing, model (Select)tion, and (Infer)ence. Participants were allowed to select all applicable answers and could select (None) or provide (Other) pressing is- sues. They could also provide a textual justification of their answer(s) (\ud835\udc449). 3.1 Analysis Figure 3a shows that more than 50% of our partici- pants were moderately (28.2%) or very (27.9%) con- cerned about the environmental footprint of NLP, while around 33% of them were slightly (14.7%) or somewhat (18.6%) concerned. 10.6% of par- ticipants were not concerned at all. Our partic- ipants further agreed that training (75.3%) and model selection (59.9%) are the most pressing is- sues (Fig. 3b).3 Inference took third place with 20.2%, while 6.1% of our participants selected none. The smallest number responses was given for other with hyperparameter tuning and travelling (6 men- tions each) being the most frequent ones. Also men- tioned were storage consumption, hardware, expec- tations about large data experiments, and scale. In- terestingly, many respondents considered inference less pressing than training and model selection. Job Sector. Although we do not find significant differences by seniority, we see larger (although not statistically significant) differences when look- ing at the responses grouped by researchers from different job sectors (Fig. 4a). We find that respon- dents from the large industry sector were mostly somewhat concerned, while the median for all other groups lies at often concerned. Similarly, we also see larger differences in the most pressing issues 3Note that 39.7% of our participants selected exactly these two as the only pressing factors.

For instance, small and large industries were substantially more concerned with respect to inference and much less concerned with respect to model selection than academia. 3.2 Discussion and Recommendations An analysis of the 81 (26%) free-text responses (\ud835\udc449) reveals diverse opinions about the environmental impact of NLP and the reasons behind the most pressing factors. For instance, among respondents that stated to be not at all concerned about NLP\u2019s environmental footprint, a majority considered the impact of NLP research on climate change to be negligible compared to other factors. Factors men- tioned as being more relevant to climate change include air travel (also mentioned twice in the gen- eral responses \ud835\udc4419), cars, and more cost intensive computations from other areas (of science). An- other argument brought up multiple times in this group of respondents is that the ACL is not the right institution to tackle challenges of climate change. Some responses alternatively suggested to push for regulatory changes, since big tech companies might not be affected by decisions made by the ACL. Regarding the most pressing factors, one of the main arguments provided for inference was that in- dustry spends most time on inference, hence it is the most expensive one. However, participants also"}, {"question": " Which sector showed larger differences in environmental concern?", "answer": " Large industry sector, compared to academia and small industry.", "ref_chunk": "stu- dent, five academic PIs, one academic post-doc, and one small industry researcher). For our analysis, we do not merge the academic and industry sub- groups, as this may obfuscate existing disparities; e.g., between small and large industry. Geographic location. We further asked respon- dents to share their geographic location (\ud835\udc443). Over- all, 45.8% of responses came from the Americas (AM), 40.4% from Europe (EU) and the Middle East (ME), and 13.8% from Asia (AS) and Australia (Aus).

The heavily skewed responses in terms of geographic location limits the expressive- ness of this factor and thus, will not be considered for our analysis. 2.3 Methodology In the following sections, we analyse and discuss the participants\u2019 responses with respect to the re- maining three categories (environmental concerns, equity, and impact on the reviewing process). For each section, we first provide an overview of the distribution in the responses and then provide a fine- grained analysis with respect to the seniority and job sector.
