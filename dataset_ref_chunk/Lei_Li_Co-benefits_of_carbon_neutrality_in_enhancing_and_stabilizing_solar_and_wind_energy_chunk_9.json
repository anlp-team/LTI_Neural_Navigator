Following previous studies15,43,62, we used daily T, I and W to calculate PVPOT: PVPOT = PR I ISTC (4) where I represents surface downwelling shortwave radiation and ISTC represents shortwave flux on the PV panel under standard test condi- tions, defined as a constant of 1,000 W m\u22122. PR is the performance ratio, representing temperature influence on PV efficiency: PR = 1 + \u03b3 (Tcell \u2212 TSTC) (5) where \u03b3 is defined as \u22120.005 \u00b0C\u22121 in monocrystalline silicon solar panels, representing the negative impact on conversion efficiency, and TSTC is the cell temperature under standard test conditions (25 \u00b0C). Tcell is the actual cell temperature, which is approximated by T, I and W: Tcell = a1 + a2 \u00d7 T + a3 \u00d7 I + a4 \u00d7 W (6) MBCn is a multivariate generalization of quantile delta mapping, which considers the dependence among different variables60. In using MBCn, three datasets are included: historical observations (Xobs), his- torical simulations (Xhist) and projected simulations (Xproj). First, we rotate Xobs, Xhist and Xproj with an N \u00d7 N uniformly distributed random orthogonal rotation matrix R[j] at the jth iteration: where a1, a2, a3 and a4 are taken as 4.3 \u00b0C, 0.943 (unitless), 0.028 \u00b0C (W m\u22122)\u22121 and \u22121.528 \u00b0C (m s\u22121)\u22121, respectively. These coefficients rep- resent the influence of meteorological conditions on the cell tem- perature. The ambient T determines the base temperature of the cell, a strong I increases the cell temperature and W decreases cell tem- perature. These coefficients are found to be fairly independent on Nature Climate Change site location and cell technology type63, which have been widely used to predict PV cell temperature15,43,64. Calculation of wind energy WPD (W m\u22122) is a typical measure of wind energy potential65, defined as follows: generation over all locations. It is well known that solar PV and wind energy generation are heavily influenced by weather fluctuation, which yields strong variability at various time scales. Understanding the variability of renewable energy is vital for coordinating compensa- tory energy sources and storage in order to secure a stable energy supply66,67. WPD = 1 2 \u03c1W3 h (7) Here, we use the metric of NMAD to quantify the day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year variability of renewable energy. For any given time series (Ti, i = 1,2,\u2026N), the NMAD (%) is defined as the mean absolute deviation divided by the mean: where \u03c1 represents the air density, which is assumed to be a constant value of 1.213 kg m\u22123 at standard atmospheric conditions, and Wh rep- resents the wind speed at the 100 m hub height. NMAD = Mean [|Ti \u2212 Mean (T) |] Mean(T) \u00d7 100%. It is noted that Wh is not available from climate model outputs here. Similar to previous studies22,23,25, Wh is extrapolated from the 10 m wind speed (W) using the wind power law: For day-to-day and month-to-month variability of solar PV and wind energy, we first calculate the corresponding NMAD for each year, and then present the multi-year average of NMAD. Wz Wzref = ( z zref \u03b1 ) where Wz represents the wind speed at a height z and Wzref represents the wind speed at a reference height zref. The scaling factor of \u03b1, repre- senting how quickly the wind decays towards the ground, is often approximated as a constant of 0.143 over land surface in previous studies22,26,45. As the ERA5 reanalysis provided wind speeds at both 10 m and 100 m, here we estimate \u03b1 at each location grid (Extended Data Fig. 7) to account for spatial disparity. The higher values of 0.2\u20130.25 are mainly located in the eastern United States, eastern China, Amazon, India and northern Asia due to large forest coverage, but the lower values of 0.12\u20130.16 usually occur in flat terrain of desert and steppe. As an improvement to a few previous studies using a constant scaling factor21,22, the wind speed at 100 m here estimated using a spatially variant scaling factor is closer to the benchmark (Supplementary Fig. 5c versus b). The normalized mean bias decreases from \u221210.1% to \u22120.4% on global average. In contrast to the large spatial heterogeneity, the scaling factor only shows a small temporal variability (Supplemen- tary Fig. 10 showing seasonal change as an example), resulting in limited benefits on estimation of 100 m wind speed (Supplementary Fig. 5d versus c; \u22120.4% improved to \u22120.3%). Therefore, the spatially variant but temporally invariant scaling factor is adopted here to estimate 100 m wind speed from the 10 m wind speed in the model output. (8) Model evaluation with bias correction Climate model simulations of solar PV and wind energy resources remain highly uncertain21,36,45. Here, we evaluate the simulated solar PV and wind energy in the historical period (1995\u20132014) against ERA5 (Extended Data Fig. 6). The observed solar PVPOT shows a smooth global spatial contrast (Extended Data Fig. 6a). In global arid and semi-arid regions, including the western United States, northern Africa, west- ern Asia and Australia, the solar PVPOT shows higher values of >0.24. However, the solar PVPOT is relatively lower in global monsoon regions, including east Asia, south Asia, central Africa, southeastern North America and the Amazon. Such a spatial pattern can be attributed to more clouds in those monsoon regions and possibly denser vegetation cover, leading to less solar radiation available at the ground level68\u201370. Compared with reanalysis, the raw output from model simulation overestimates the solar PVPOT by more than 15% in southeastern Asia, the Amazon and western Africa, but underestimates it by approximately 10% in the western United States, northeastern Asia and western Asia (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Using the MBCn technique to jointly correct T, I and W, the calculated solar PVPOT from the model simulation agrees well with the observation, with a relative bias of less than 1% over all land grids (Extended Data Fig. 6e). The actual wind power (WP in KW) is sensitive to wind speed and wind turbine.

Similar to previous studies22,23,25, Wh is extrapolated from the 10 m wind speed (W) using the wind power law: For day-to-day and month-to-month variability of solar PV and wind energy, we first calculate the corresponding NMAD for each year, and then present the multi-year average of NMAD. Wz Wzref = ( z zref \u03b1 ) where Wz represents the wind speed at a height z and Wzref represents the wind speed at a reference height zref. The scaling factor of \u03b1, repre- senting how quickly the wind decays towards the ground, is often approximated as a constant of 0.143 over land surface in previous studies22,26,45. As the ERA5 reanalysis provided wind speeds at both 10 m and 100 m, here we estimate \u03b1 at each location grid (Extended Data Fig. 7) to account for spatial disparity. The higher values of 0.2\u20130.25 are mainly located in the eastern United States, eastern China, Amazon, India and northern Asia due to large forest coverage, but the lower values of 0.12\u20130.16 usually occur in flat terrain of desert and steppe. As an improvement to a few previous studies using a constant scaling factor21,22, the wind speed at 100 m here estimated using a spatially variant scaling factor is closer to the benchmark (Supplementary Fig. 5c versus b). The normalized mean bias decreases from \u221210.1% to \u22120.4% on global average. In contrast to the large spatial heterogeneity, the scaling factor only shows a small temporal variability (Supplemen- tary Fig. 10 showing seasonal change as an example), resulting in limited benefits on estimation of 100 m wind speed (Supplementary Fig. 5d versus c; \u22120.4% improved to \u22120.3%). Therefore, the spatially variant but temporally invariant scaling factor is adopted here to estimate 100 m wind speed from the 10 m wind speed in the model output. (8) Model evaluation with bias correction Climate model simulations of solar PV and wind energy resources remain highly uncertain21,36,45. Here, we evaluate the simulated solar PV and wind energy in the historical period (1995\u20132014) against ERA5 (Extended Data Fig. 6). The observed solar PVPOT shows a smooth global spatial contrast (Extended Data Fig. 6a). In global arid and semi-arid regions, including the western United States, northern Africa, west- ern Asia and Australia, the solar PVPOT shows higher values of >0.24. However, the solar PVPOT is relatively lower in global monsoon regions, including east Asia, south Asia, central Africa, southeastern North America and the Amazon. Such a spatial pattern can be attributed to more clouds in those monsoon regions and possibly denser vegetation cover, leading to less solar radiation available at the ground level68\u201370. Compared with reanalysis, the raw output from model simulation overestimates the solar PVPOT by more than 15% in southeastern Asia, the Amazon and western Africa, but underestimates it by approximately 10% in the western United States, northeastern Asia and western Asia (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Using the MBCn technique to jointly correct T, I and W, the calculated solar PVPOT from the model simulation agrees well with the observation, with a relative bias of less than 1% over all land grids (Extended Data Fig. 6e). The actual wind power (WP in KW) is sensitive to wind speed and wind turbine.

Using the MBCn technique to jointly correct T, I and W, the calculated solar PVPOT from the model simulation agrees well with the observation, with a relative bias of less than 1% over all land grids (Extended Data Fig. 6e). The actual wind power (WP in KW) is sensitive to wind speed and wind turbine. Here, we adopt a typical wind turbine of"}, {"question": " What is the main factor that contributes to the spatial pattern of solar PVPOT differences between regions according to the text?", "answer": " The spatial pattern of solar PVPOT differences between regions is mainly attributed to variations in cloud cover and vegetation density.", "ref_chunk": "power capacity is the actual PV power generation. Following previous studies15,43,62, we used daily T, I and W to calculate PVPOT: PVPOT = PR I ISTC (4) where I represents surface downwelling shortwave radiation and ISTC represents shortwave flux on the PV panel under standard test condi- tions, defined as a constant of 1,000 W m\u22122. PR is the performance ratio, representing temperature influence on PV efficiency: PR = 1 + \u03b3 (Tcell \u2212 TSTC) (5) where \u03b3 is defined as \u22120.005 \u00b0C\u22121 in monocrystalline silicon solar panels, representing the negative impact on conversion efficiency, and TSTC is the cell temperature under standard test conditions (25 \u00b0C). Tcell is the actual cell temperature, which is approximated by T, I and W: Tcell = a1 + a2 \u00d7 T + a3 \u00d7 I + a4 \u00d7 W (6) MBCn is a multivariate generalization of quantile delta mapping, which considers the dependence among different variables60. In using MBCn, three datasets are included: historical observations (Xobs), his- torical simulations (Xhist) and projected simulations (Xproj). First, we rotate Xobs, Xhist and Xproj with an N \u00d7 N uniformly distributed random orthogonal rotation matrix R[j] at the jth iteration: where a1, a2, a3 and a4 are taken as 4.3 \u00b0C, 0.943 (unitless), 0.028 \u00b0C (W m\u22122)\u22121 and \u22121.528 \u00b0C (m s\u22121)\u22121, respectively. These coefficients rep- resent the influence of meteorological conditions on the cell tem- perature. The ambient T determines the base temperature of the cell, a strong I increases the cell temperature and W decreases cell tem- perature. These coefficients are found to be fairly independent on Nature Climate Change site location and cell technology type63, which have been widely used to predict PV cell temperature15,43,64. Calculation of wind energy WPD (W m\u22122) is a typical measure of wind energy potential65, defined as follows: generation over all locations. It is well known that solar PV and wind energy generation are heavily influenced by weather fluctuation, which yields strong variability at various time scales. Understanding the variability of renewable energy is vital for coordinating compensa- tory energy sources and storage in order to secure a stable energy supply66,67. WPD = 1 2 \u03c1W3 h (7) Here, we use the metric of NMAD to quantify the day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year variability of renewable energy. For any given time series (Ti, i = 1,2,\u2026N), the NMAD (%) is defined as the mean absolute deviation divided by the mean: where \u03c1 represents the air density, which is assumed to be a constant value of 1.213 kg m\u22123 at standard atmospheric conditions, and Wh rep- resents the wind speed at the 100 m hub height. NMAD = Mean [|Ti \u2212 Mean (T) |] Mean(T) \u00d7 100%. It is noted that Wh is not available from climate model outputs here. Similar to previous studies22,23,25, Wh is extrapolated from the 10 m wind speed (W) using the wind power law: For day-to-day and month-to-month variability of solar PV and wind energy, we first calculate the corresponding NMAD for each year, and then present the multi-year average of NMAD. Wz Wzref = ( z zref \u03b1 ) where Wz represents the wind speed at a height z and Wzref represents the wind speed at a reference height zref. The scaling factor of \u03b1, repre- senting how quickly the wind decays towards the ground, is often approximated as a constant of 0.143 over land surface in previous studies22,26,45. As the ERA5 reanalysis provided wind speeds at both 10 m and 100 m, here we estimate \u03b1 at each location grid (Extended Data Fig. 7) to account for spatial disparity. The higher values of 0.2\u20130.25 are mainly located in the eastern United States, eastern China, Amazon, India and northern Asia due to large forest coverage, but the lower values of 0.12\u20130.16 usually occur in flat terrain of desert and steppe. As an improvement to a few previous studies using a constant scaling factor21,22, the wind speed at 100 m here estimated using a spatially variant scaling factor is closer to the benchmark (Supplementary Fig. 5c versus b). The normalized mean bias decreases from \u221210.1% to \u22120.4% on global average. In contrast to the large spatial heterogeneity, the scaling factor only shows a small temporal variability (Supplemen- tary Fig. 10 showing seasonal change as an example), resulting in limited benefits on estimation of 100 m wind speed (Supplementary Fig. 5d versus c; \u22120.4% improved to \u22120.3%). Therefore, the spatially variant but temporally invariant scaling factor is adopted here to estimate 100 m wind speed from the 10 m wind speed in the model output. (8) Model evaluation with bias correction Climate model simulations of solar PV and wind energy resources remain highly uncertain21,36,45. Here, we evaluate the simulated solar PV and wind energy in the historical period (1995\u20132014) against ERA5 (Extended Data Fig. 6). The observed solar PVPOT shows a smooth global spatial contrast (Extended Data Fig. 6a). In global arid and semi-arid regions, including the western United States, northern Africa, west- ern Asia and Australia, the solar PVPOT shows higher values of >0.24. However, the solar PVPOT is relatively lower in global monsoon regions, including east Asia, south Asia, central Africa, southeastern North America and the Amazon. Such a spatial pattern can be attributed to more clouds in those monsoon regions and possibly denser vegetation cover, leading to less solar radiation available at the ground level68\u201370.
