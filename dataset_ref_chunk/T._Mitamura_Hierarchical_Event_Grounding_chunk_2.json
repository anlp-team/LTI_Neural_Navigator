(2012) proposed linking event references in newswire articles to an archive of \ufb01rst re- ports of the events. Recent work on this task focused on link- ing mentions to knowledge bases like Wikipedia (Yu et al. 2021) and Wikidata (Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura 2022). Our work is built upon the latter with a speci\ufb01c focus on hierarchical event structures in Wikidata. Event Typing: Given an event mention span and its con- text, typing aims at classifying the mention into one or more types from a pre-de\ufb01ned ontology. Commonly used ontolo- gies include ACE 2005 (Walker et al. 2006), Rich-ERE (Song et al. 2015), TAC-KBP (Mitamura, Liu, and Hovy 2017). In contrast, event linking grounds mentions to one or more events from a KB (e.g., World War II in Wikidata vs Con\ufb02ict type in ACE 2005). Hierarchy Modeling: Chen, Chen, and Van Durme (2020) presented a rank-based loss that utilizes entity ontol- ogy for hierarchical entity typing task. Murty et al. (2018) explored a complex structured loss and Onoe et al. (2021) utilized box embeddings (Vilnis et al. 2018) to model hier- archical relations between entity types. 3 Hierarchical Event Grounding The task of grounding involves linking event references in text documents to the corresponding entries in a knowl- edge base (Chandu, Bisk, and Black 2021). Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura (2022) studied linking event references from Wikipedia and Wikinews articles to Wikidata items. How- ever, they restrict the dictionary of Wikidata items to leaf events. This ignores important parent events such as \u2018Op- eration Overlord\u2019 and \u2018Western Front (World War II)\u2019 from Figure 1. In our preliminary analysis, we observed a sig- ni\ufb01cant number of mentions that refer to the parent events, motivating us to expand the dictionary to include all events. Modeling hierarchy relations between events has been ex- tensively studied (Glava\u02c7s et al. 2014; Mitamura, Liu, and Hovy 2017; Du et al. 2022). These works typically focus on hierarchical relations among mentions in a document. In contrast, we focus on hierarchical relations among events in a KB. At a high level, this can be viewed as a combination of coreference resolution and hierarchy relation extraction. Relation Extraction: Extracting temporal, causal, and sub-event relations has been an integral part of event ex- traction pipelines. Glava\u02c7s et al. (2014) presented a dataset for studying hierarchical relations among events in news ar- ticles. Ning, Wu, and Roth (2018) studied event temporal relations, and Han et al. (2021) proposed extracting event relations as a question-answering task. 3.1 Task De\ufb01nition Consider an event knowledge base (K) that constitutes a set of events (E) and their relations (R). Each event (ei \u2208 E) has an id, title, and description. The relation set (R) includes both temporal and hierarchical (parent-child) links between events. Given an input mention span m from a text docu- ment, the task is to predict an unordered subset of events (Em \u2282 E). This set Em constitutes events within a hier- archy tree, from the leaf to the root of the tree.4 In Figure 1, the mention \u2018Normandy campaign\u2019 is to linked to the set {Q8641370, Q216184}, whereas the mention \u2018Falaise Gap\u2019 is linked to {Q602744, Q8641370, Q216184}. We follow prior work on linking (Logeswaran et al. 2019) to formulate the task in a zero-shot fashion. Speci\ufb01cally, the set of event hierarchies for evaluation is completely unseen during training. Following Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura (2022), we present two task variants, 1. Multilingual, where the event title and description are given in the same language as the mention and its context, and 2. Crosslingual, where the event title and description are in English. An alternate task formulation involves traditional event linking followed by hierarchy propagation in the KB. How- ever, such a formulation requires access to gold hierarchy relations at test time. In contrast, we present a task that fa- cilitates hierarchy relation extraction among unseen events. 3.2 Hierarchical Relation Extraction In addition to our key focus task of event linking, we ex- plore hierarchical relation extraction for events. Similar to standard KB relation extraction (Trouillon et al. 2016), this involves predicting parent-child relationships in the KB. Speci\ufb01cally, given a hierarchical triple (ec, r, ep) in K, where ec is the child of ep and r is the child \u2192 parent re- lation, we mask ep and task models to retrieve it from the pool of events in K. To this end, we present a methodology to utilize our trained event-linking system for hierarchical relation extraction in Wikidata (\u00a75.3). 4 Dataset To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing datasets for the task of hierarchical event linking. Therefore, we ex- pand the XLEL-WD dataset (Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura 2022) to include hierarchical event structures. 4.1 Event and Mention Collection Following prior work, we use Wikidata as our KB and fol- low a three-step process to collect events and their men- tions. First, events are identi\ufb01ed from Wikidata items by de- termining whether they have caused a change of state and possess spatio-temporal attributes. Then each event is asso- ciated with a set of language Wikipedia articles following the pointer contained in the event Wikidata item page. The title and description for each event in different languages are therefore obtained by taking the title and \ufb01rst paragraph of the associated language Wikipedia article.

Given an input mention span m from a text docu- ment, the task is to predict an unordered subset of events (Em \u2282 E). This set Em constitutes events within a hier- archy tree, from the leaf to the root of the tree.4 In Figure 1, the mention \u2018Normandy campaign\u2019 is to linked to the set {Q8641370, Q216184}, whereas the mention \u2018Falaise Gap\u2019 is linked to {Q602744, Q8641370, Q216184}. We follow prior work on linking (Logeswaran et al. 2019) to formulate the task in a zero-shot fashion. Speci\ufb01cally, the set of event hierarchies for evaluation is completely unseen during training. Following Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura (2022), we present two task variants, 1. Multilingual, where the event title and description are given in the same language as the mention and its context, and 2. Crosslingual, where the event title and description are in English. An alternate task formulation involves traditional event linking followed by hierarchy propagation in the KB. How- ever, such a formulation requires access to gold hierarchy relations at test time. In contrast, we present a task that fa- cilitates hierarchy relation extraction among unseen events. 3.2 Hierarchical Relation Extraction In addition to our key focus task of event linking, we ex- plore hierarchical relation extraction for events. Similar to standard KB relation extraction (Trouillon et al. 2016), this involves predicting parent-child relationships in the KB. Speci\ufb01cally, given a hierarchical triple (ec, r, ep) in K, where ec is the child of ep and r is the child \u2192 parent re- lation, we mask ep and task models to retrieve it from the pool of events in K. To this end, we present a methodology to utilize our trained event-linking system for hierarchical relation extraction in Wikidata (\u00a75.3). 4 Dataset To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing datasets for the task of hierarchical event linking. Therefore, we ex- pand the XLEL-WD dataset (Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura 2022) to include hierarchical event structures. 4.1 Event and Mention Collection Following prior work, we use Wikidata as our KB and fol- low a three-step process to collect events and their men- tions. First, events are identi\ufb01ed from Wikidata items by de- termining whether they have caused a change of state and possess spatio-temporal attributes. Then each event is asso- ciated with a set of language Wikipedia articles following the pointer contained in the event Wikidata item page. The title and description for each event in different languages are therefore obtained by taking the title and \ufb01rst paragraph of the associated language Wikipedia article. Finally, men- tions linked"}, {"question": " How does the text expand the XLEL-WD dataset?", "answer": " The text expands the XLEL-WD dataset to include hierarchical event structures, collecting events and their mentions from Wikidata using a three-step process.", "ref_chunk": "mention linking to hierarchical event structures in Wikidata. The left column shows three mentions (highlighted) with their contexts, and the right column presents a hierarchy of Q-nodes from Wikidata. Each mention is linked to a set of events from a hierarchy path from Wikidata (e.g., mention \u2018Normandy campaign\u2019 is linked to a set of two events, {Q8641370, Q216184}). articles linking to a set of events from Wikidata that are organized into hierarchies. We present a methodology that incorporates hierarchy- based loss for the grounding task. We show improve- ments over competitive retrieve-and-rerank baselines. \u2022 We demonstrate an application of our linking systems for zero-shot hierarchical relation extraction. 2 Related Work Event Linking: Nothman et al. (2012) proposed linking event references in newswire articles to an archive of \ufb01rst re- ports of the events. Recent work on this task focused on link- ing mentions to knowledge bases like Wikipedia (Yu et al. 2021) and Wikidata (Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura 2022). Our work is built upon the latter with a speci\ufb01c focus on hierarchical event structures in Wikidata. Event Typing: Given an event mention span and its con- text, typing aims at classifying the mention into one or more types from a pre-de\ufb01ned ontology. Commonly used ontolo- gies include ACE 2005 (Walker et al. 2006), Rich-ERE (Song et al. 2015), TAC-KBP (Mitamura, Liu, and Hovy 2017). In contrast, event linking grounds mentions to one or more events from a KB (e.g., World War II in Wikidata vs Con\ufb02ict type in ACE 2005). Hierarchy Modeling: Chen, Chen, and Van Durme (2020) presented a rank-based loss that utilizes entity ontol- ogy for hierarchical entity typing task. Murty et al. (2018) explored a complex structured loss and Onoe et al. (2021) utilized box embeddings (Vilnis et al. 2018) to model hier- archical relations between entity types. 3 Hierarchical Event Grounding The task of grounding involves linking event references in text documents to the corresponding entries in a knowl- edge base (Chandu, Bisk, and Black 2021). Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura (2022) studied linking event references from Wikipedia and Wikinews articles to Wikidata items. How- ever, they restrict the dictionary of Wikidata items to leaf events. This ignores important parent events such as \u2018Op- eration Overlord\u2019 and \u2018Western Front (World War II)\u2019 from Figure 1. In our preliminary analysis, we observed a sig- ni\ufb01cant number of mentions that refer to the parent events, motivating us to expand the dictionary to include all events. Modeling hierarchy relations between events has been ex- tensively studied (Glava\u02c7s et al. 2014; Mitamura, Liu, and Hovy 2017; Du et al. 2022). These works typically focus on hierarchical relations among mentions in a document. In contrast, we focus on hierarchical relations among events in a KB. At a high level, this can be viewed as a combination of coreference resolution and hierarchy relation extraction. Relation Extraction: Extracting temporal, causal, and sub-event relations has been an integral part of event ex- traction pipelines. Glava\u02c7s et al. (2014) presented a dataset for studying hierarchical relations among events in news ar- ticles. Ning, Wu, and Roth (2018) studied event temporal relations, and Han et al.

Event Typing: Given an event mention span and its con- text, typing aims at classifying the mention into one or more types from a pre-de\ufb01ned ontology. Commonly used ontolo- gies include ACE 2005 (Walker et al. 2006), Rich-ERE (Song et al. 2015), TAC-KBP (Mitamura, Liu, and Hovy 2017). In contrast, event linking grounds mentions to one or more events from a KB (e.g., World War II in Wikidata vs Con\ufb02ict type in ACE 2005). Hierarchy Modeling: Chen, Chen, and Van Durme (2020) presented a rank-based loss that utilizes entity ontol- ogy for hierarchical entity typing task. Murty et al. (2018) explored a complex structured loss and Onoe et al. (2021) utilized box embeddings (Vilnis et al. 2018) to model hier- archical relations between entity types. 3 Hierarchical Event Grounding The task of grounding involves linking event references in text documents to the corresponding entries in a knowl- edge base (Chandu, Bisk, and Black 2021). Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura (2022) studied linking event references from Wikipedia and Wikinews articles to Wikidata items. How- ever, they restrict the dictionary of Wikidata items to leaf events. This ignores important parent events such as \u2018Op- eration Overlord\u2019 and \u2018Western Front (World War II)\u2019 from Figure 1. In our preliminary analysis, we observed a sig- ni\ufb01cant number of mentions that refer to the parent events, motivating us to expand the dictionary to include all events. Modeling hierarchy relations between events has been ex- tensively studied (Glava\u02c7s et al. 2014; Mitamura, Liu, and Hovy 2017; Du et al. 2022). These works typically focus on hierarchical relations among mentions in a document. In contrast, we focus on hierarchical relations among events in a KB. At a high level, this can be viewed as a combination of coreference resolution and hierarchy relation extraction. Relation Extraction: Extracting temporal, causal, and sub-event relations has been an integral part of event ex- traction pipelines. Glava\u02c7s et al. (2014) presented a dataset for studying hierarchical relations among events in news ar- ticles. Ning, Wu, and Roth (2018) studied event temporal relations, and Han et al. (2021) proposed extracting event relations as a question-answering task. 3.1 Task De\ufb01nition Consider an event knowledge base (K) that constitutes a set of events (E) and their relations (R). Each event (ei \u2208 E) has an id, title, and description. The relation set (R) includes both temporal and hierarchical (parent-child) links between events. Given an input mention span m from a text docu- ment, the task is to predict an unordered subset of events (Em \u2282 E). This set Em constitutes events within a hier- archy tree, from the leaf to the root of the tree.4 In Figure 1, the mention \u2018Normandy campaign\u2019 is to linked to the set {Q8641370, Q216184}, whereas the mention \u2018Falaise Gap\u2019 is linked to {Q602744, Q8641370, Q216184}. We follow prior work on linking (Logeswaran et al. 2019) to formulate the task in a zero-shot fashion. Speci\ufb01cally, the set of event hierarchies for evaluation is completely unseen during training. Following Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura (2022), we present two task variants, 1. Multilingual, where the event title and description are given in the same language as the mention and its context, and 2. Crosslingual, where the event title and description are in English. An alternate task formulation involves traditional event linking followed by hierarchy propagation in the KB. How- ever, such a formulation requires access to gold hierarchy relations at test time. In contrast, we present a task that fa- cilitates hierarchy relation extraction among unseen events. 3.2 Hierarchical Relation Extraction In addition to our key focus task of event linking, we ex- plore hierarchical relation extraction for events. Similar to standard KB relation extraction (Trouillon et al. 2016), this involves predicting parent-child relationships in the KB. Speci\ufb01cally, given a hierarchical triple (ec, r, ep) in K, where ec is the child of ep and r is the child \u2192 parent re- lation, we mask ep and task models to retrieve it from the pool of events in K. To this end, we present a methodology to utilize our trained event-linking system for hierarchical relation extraction in Wikidata (\u00a75.3). 4 Dataset To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing datasets for the task of hierarchical event linking. Therefore, we ex- pand the XLEL-WD dataset (Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura 2022) to include hierarchical event structures. 4.1 Event and Mention Collection Following prior work, we use Wikidata as our KB and fol- low a three-step process to collect events and their men- tions. First, events are identi\ufb01ed from Wikidata items by de- termining whether they have caused a change of state and possess spatio-temporal attributes. Then each event is asso- ciated with a set of language Wikipedia articles following the pointer contained in the event Wikidata item page. The title and description for each event in different languages are therefore obtained by taking the title and \ufb01rst paragraph of the associated language Wikipedia article.

The left column shows three mentions (highlighted) with their contexts, and the right column presents a hierarchy of Q-nodes from Wikidata. Each mention is linked to a set of events from a hierarchy path from Wikidata (e.g., mention \u2018Normandy campaign\u2019 is linked to a set of two events, {Q8641370, Q216184}). articles linking to a set of events from Wikidata that are organized into hierarchies. We present a methodology that incorporates hierarchy- based loss for the grounding task.
