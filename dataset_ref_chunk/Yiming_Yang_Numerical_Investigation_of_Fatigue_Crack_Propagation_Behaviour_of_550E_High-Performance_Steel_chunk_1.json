Abstract: The fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance steel (HPS) is studied in this paper. Static tensile testing and fatigue crack propagation testing were carried out, and the results were compared with those of Q235. Finite element models were developed and veri\ufb01ed against the experimental results. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of the HPS were analysed. The results show that the fatigue life of Q550 was reduced by 18% due to the corrosion pitting, but it did not change the crack propagation path. When the stress intensity factor is higher than a certain value, the fatigue performance of Q235 is better than that of Q550E. The initial crack angle of 52.5\u25e6 is the critical angle of the crack stress intensity factor. The steel tends to fracture as the crack depth ratio increases, and more attention should be paid to the effective crack length in engineering practice. An increasing stress ratio leads to a smaller stress intensity factor, and the thickness affects the stress intensity factor in the later stage. The crack stress intensity factor around the corrosion pits gradually decreases along the thickness direction, and the crack tips around the corrosion pits tend to reach the yield state initially, accelerating the fatigue fracture of the specimen and ultimately leading to a decrease in fatigue life.

Abstract: The fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance steel (HPS) is studied in this paper. Static tensile testing and fatigue crack propagation testing were carried out, and the results were compared with those of Q235. Finite element models were developed and veri\ufb01ed against the experimental results. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of the HPS were analysed. The results show that the fatigue life of Q550 was reduced by 18% due to the corrosion pitting, but it did not change the crack propagation path. When the stress intensity factor is higher than a certain value, the fatigue performance of Q235 is better than that of Q550E. The initial crack angle of 52.5\u25e6 is the critical angle of the crack stress intensity factor. The steel tends to fracture as the crack depth ratio increases, and more attention should be paid to the effective crack length in engineering practice. An increasing stress ratio leads to a smaller stress intensity factor, and the thickness affects the stress intensity factor in the later stage. The crack stress intensity factor around the corrosion pits gradually decreases along the thickness direction, and the crack tips around the corrosion pits tend to reach the yield state initially, accelerating the fatigue fracture of the specimen and ultimately leading to a decrease in fatigue life.

Abstract: The fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance steel (HPS) is studied in this paper. Static tensile testing and fatigue crack propagation testing were carried out, and the results were compared with those of Q235. Finite element models were developed and veri\ufb01ed against the experimental results. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of the HPS were analysed. The results show that the fatigue life of Q550 was reduced by 18% due to the corrosion pitting, but it did not change the crack propagation path. When the stress intensity factor is higher than a certain value, the fatigue performance of Q235 is better than that of Q550E. The initial crack angle of 52.5\u25e6 is the critical angle of the crack stress intensity factor. The steel tends to fracture as the crack depth ratio increases, and more attention should be paid to the effective crack length in engineering practice. An increasing stress ratio leads to a smaller stress intensity factor, and the thickness affects the stress intensity factor in the later stage. The crack stress intensity factor around the corrosion pits gradually decreases along the thickness direction, and the crack tips around the corrosion pits tend to reach the yield state initially, accelerating the fatigue fracture of the specimen and ultimately leading to a decrease in fatigue life.

Introduction Academic Editor: Guy Pluvinage Received: 18 July 2023 Revised: 10 August 2023 Accepted: 17 August 2023 Published: 21 August 2023 Bridge structures are developing in the direction of large span, high load, light weight, and environmental protection [1]. The performance of steel is also improving with the increasing demands of engineering construction, resulting in high-performance steel for bridges [2,3]. Compared to ordinary steel, high-performance steel (HPS) shows higher strength, higher fracture toughness, and better fatigue resistance [4\u20137]. As a result, HPS is widely used in various steel bridges [8], such as the sea-crossing bridge, Akashi Kaikyo Bridge. Copyright: \u00a9 2023 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Yaagoubi and Meier [17] studied the relationship between surface cracks with different angles and the J-integral, and they showed that the increase in friction effect in the case of oblique cracks weakened the J-integral at the crack tip. But there has been no in-depth study on penetrating cracks, which are more harmful to the structure; these will be studied in this paper for HPS steel. Although the effective initial crack in the process of crack propagation is very short, it is extremely destructive since there are some invisible initial cracks. Therefore, it is necessary to undertake in-depth study on the crack depth ratio. Meanwhile, most scholars have focused on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of ordinary steel beams [18,19], and there have been insuf\ufb01cient investigations on fatigue crack failure of high-performance steel. Kang and Hong [20] studied the fatigue properties of HPS, and their results showed that the fatigue strength of Q690D HPS was signi\ufb01cantly higher than existing speci\ufb01cations. It is known that the joint action of a corrosive environment and repeated stress is one of the main reasons for the premature failure of most engineering metals, especially in marine environments [21,22]. This usually leads to the premature initiation of fatigue cracks on the surface of materials, resulting in reductions in fatigue life and resistance [23\u201325]. The research on the crack growth rate of different kinds of steels is extensive [26], but the driving factors affecting the crack growth rate of HPS are not well understood [27\u201329]. The effects of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting have not attracted enough attention, but they are very important for the fatigue safety of high-performance steel structures [30].
