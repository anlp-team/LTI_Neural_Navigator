Heavy pollution events (HPEs) were studied in the Beijing area during autumn and winter in 2017\u20132020 and the HPEs were divided into an early transport stage and a cumulating stage [49\u201355]. Southerly winds prevailed in the Beijing area during the transport stage and pollutants from south of Beijing were transported to the city. The solar radiation reaching the near-ground layer was reduced in the cumulating phase as a result of the extinction effect of particulate matter. This generated or enhanced the inversion layer and increased the relative humidity, which, in turn, inhibited turbulence, decreased the height of the boundary layer and inhibited the diffusion of pollutants. The higher relative humidity also promoted the hygroscopic growth of aerosols, accelerated liquid-phase and non-homogeneous-phase reactions, and increased the concentration of pollutants. This, in turn, led to a further deterioration in the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer. This two-way feedback mechanism has an important role in the formation and maintenance of heavy pollution in Beijing. Most of the rapid increase in pollutants in these studies started from around 12:00 to 17:00 [49\u201355]. However, most studies have been based on overall measurements of a vertical atmospheric column without considering the vertical distribution of aerosols. There have been relatively few studies on the optical properties of aerosols and their in\ufb02uence on the development of pollution on a vertical scale. We therefore need detailed information on the vertical distribution and optical properties of aerosols to further investigate their interconnection with, and in\ufb02uence on, the meteorological conditions in the boundary layer. This will help us to improve and validate numerical models and satellite data [23]. We obtained vertical pro\ufb01les of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient from long-term obser- vations at the Raman\u2013Mie LiDAR system located at the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS) from September 2017 to February 2021.

We then explored the interconnections between the vertical distribution of aerosols, their optical properties and the meteorological condi- tions within the boundary layer during HPEs in Beijing from 8 to 15 February 2020. These results not only enrich our understanding of the regional climate and the in\ufb02uence of local pollution events, but also contribute to validating numerical simulation results and improving LiDAR algorithms. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the observa- tional sites, data and methods. Section 3 presents the climatological characteristics of the vertical distribution of aerosols and the interconnections between the vertical distribution of aerosols, their optical properties and the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer during HPEs in Beijing. Our detailed conclusions are given in Section 4. 2. Data and Methods 2.1. Sun Photometer and LiDAR Measurements and Site Descriptions We used the GQB I-03 atmospheric water vapor aerosol LiDAR at the CAMS observa- tory to obtain the vertical pro\ufb01les of the optical properties of aerosols from September 2017 to February 2021. The instrument consists of six parts: a laser emission unit, a receiving telescope, a spectroscopic unit, a detector, an acquisition card and a control unit. The instrument emits a 532 nm wavelength laser and accepts 532 nm parallel and perpendicular and 607 and 660 nm Raman scattering signals. These signals are used to determine the physical properties of atmospheric aerosols, including the identi\ufb01cation of non-spherical particles and the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient, by detecting the scattering of the 532 nm laser using a polarization meter [56]. Raman-Mie LiDAR has a detection blind area of 200 m and a vertical resolution of 7.5 m.

Aerosol particles are not easily diffused vertically because the free atmosphere above the boundary layer is in a relatively static state. The aerosol concentration in the free atmosphere is therefore much lower than that in the boundary layer and the extinction coef\ufb01cient decreases abruptly at a certain height with a gradient extreme, which we regard as the aerosol boundary layer height. We can obtain the aerosol boundary layer height by inversion of the vertical abrupt rate of change of the extinction coef\ufb01cient. We use the aerosol boundary layer height to approximate the boundary layer height. The sun photometer(CE-318, Cimel Electronique, Paris, France) is located on the roof of the CAMS building (at about 106 m above ground level) and was operated in February 2020 to obtain the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the optical properties of the aerosols.

It measures wavelengths of 340, 380, 440, 500, 670, 870, 1020 and 1640 nm and obtains the optical properties of aerosols from sky brightness and direct solar radiation measurements in the 440, 500, 670, 870, 1020 and 1640 nm channels, combined with direct solar AOD detection at the same wave- lengths [13,14,22,57\u201359].

The higher relative humidity also promoted the hygroscopic growth of aerosols, accelerated liquid-phase and non-homogeneous-phase reactions, and increased the concentration of pollutants. This, in turn, led to a further deterioration in the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer. This two-way feedback mechanism has an important role in the formation and maintenance of heavy pollution in Beijing. Most of the rapid increase in pollutants in these studies started from around 12:00 to 17:00 [49\u201355]. However, most studies have been based on overall measurements of a vertical atmospheric column without considering the vertical distribution of aerosols. There have been relatively few studies on the optical properties of aerosols and their in\ufb02uence on the development of pollution on a vertical scale. We therefore need detailed information on the vertical distribution and optical properties of aerosols to further investigate their interconnection with, and in\ufb02uence on, the meteorological conditions in the boundary layer. This will help us to improve and validate numerical models and satellite data [23]. We obtained vertical pro\ufb01les of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient from long-term obser- vations at the Raman\u2013Mie LiDAR system located at the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS) from September 2017 to February 2021. We used these pro\ufb01les to repre- sent the vertical distribution of aerosols and studied the temporal variation of the vertical 2 of 22 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 475 3 of 22 distribution of aerosols in urban Beijing. We then explored the interconnections between the vertical distribution of aerosols, their optical properties and the meteorological condi- tions within the boundary layer during HPEs in Beijing from 8 to 15 February 2020. These results not only enrich our understanding of the regional climate and the in\ufb02uence of local pollution events, but also contribute to validating numerical simulation results and improving LiDAR algorithms. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the observa- tional sites, data and methods. Section 3 presents the climatological characteristics of the vertical distribution of aerosols and the interconnections between the vertical distribution of aerosols, their optical properties and the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer during HPEs in Beijing. Our detailed conclusions are given in Section 4. 2. Data and Methods 2.1. Sun Photometer and LiDAR Measurements and Site Descriptions We used the GQB I-03 atmospheric water vapor aerosol LiDAR at the CAMS observa- tory to obtain the vertical pro\ufb01les of the optical properties of aerosols from September 2017 to February 2021. The instrument consists of six parts: a laser emission unit, a receiving telescope, a spectroscopic unit, a detector, an acquisition card and a control unit. The instrument emits a 532 nm wavelength laser and accepts 532 nm parallel and perpendicular and 607 and 660 nm Raman scattering signals. These signals are used to determine the physical properties of atmospheric aerosols, including the identi\ufb01cation of non-spherical particles and the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient, by detecting the scattering of the 532 nm laser using a polarization meter [56]. Raman-Mie LiDAR has a detection blind area of 200 m and a vertical resolution of 7.5 m. The aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient is retrieved using the algorithm of Fernald as follows, which considers the atmosphere to consist of air molecules and aerosols.

Aerosol particles are not easily diffused vertically because the free atmosphere above the boundary layer is in a relatively static state. The aerosol concentration in the free atmosphere is therefore much lower than that in the boundary layer and the extinction coef\ufb01cient decreases abruptly at a certain height with a gradient extreme, which we regard as the aerosol boundary layer height. We can obtain the aerosol boundary layer height by inversion of the vertical abrupt rate of change of the extinction coef\ufb01cient. We use the aerosol boundary layer height to approximate the boundary layer height. The sun photometer(CE-318, Cimel Electronique, Paris, France) is located on the roof of the CAMS building (at about 106 m above ground level) and was operated in February 2020 to obtain the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the optical properties of the aerosols.

We obtained vertical pro\ufb01les of the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient from long-term obser- vations at the Raman\u2013Mie LiDAR system located at the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS) from September 2017 to February 2021.

We then explored the interconnections between the vertical distribution of aerosols, their optical properties and the meteorological condi- tions within the boundary layer during HPEs in Beijing from 8 to 15 February 2020. These results not only enrich our understanding of the regional climate and the in\ufb02uence of local pollution events, but also contribute to validating numerical simulation results and improving LiDAR algorithms. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the observa- tional sites, data and methods. Section 3 presents the climatological characteristics of the vertical distribution of aerosols and the interconnections between the vertical distribution of aerosols, their optical properties and the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer during HPEs in Beijing. Our detailed conclusions are given in Section 4. 2. Data and Methods 2.1. Sun Photometer and LiDAR Measurements and Site Descriptions We used the GQB I-03 atmospheric water vapor aerosol LiDAR at the CAMS observa- tory to obtain the vertical pro\ufb01les of the optical properties of aerosols from September 2017 to February 2021. The instrument consists of six parts: a laser emission unit, a receiving telescope, a spectroscopic unit, a detector, an acquisition card and a control unit. The instrument emits a 532 nm wavelength laser and accepts 532 nm parallel and perpendicular and 607 and 660 nm Raman scattering signals. These signals are used to determine the physical properties of atmospheric aerosols, including the identi\ufb01cation of non-spherical particles and the aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient, by detecting the scattering of the 532 nm laser using a polarization meter [56]. Raman-Mie LiDAR has a detection blind area of 200 m and a vertical resolution of 7.5 m. The aerosol extinction coef\ufb01cient is retrieved using the algorithm of Fernald as follows, which considers the atmosphere to consist of air molecules and aerosols.

Aerosol particles are not easily diffused vertically because the free atmosphere above the boundary layer is in a relatively static state. The aerosol concentration in the free atmosphere is therefore much lower than that in the boundary layer and the extinction coef\ufb01cient decreases abruptly at a certain height with a gradient extreme, which we regard as the aerosol boundary layer height. We can obtain the aerosol boundary layer height by inversion of the vertical abrupt rate of change of the extinction coef\ufb01cient. We use the aerosol boundary layer height to approximate the boundary layer height. The sun photometer(CE-318, Cimel Electronique, Paris, France) is located on the roof of the CAMS building (at about 106 m above ground level) and was operated in February 2020 to obtain the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the optical properties of the aerosols. The instrument has an uncertainty in cloud-screened AODs calculated by ASTPwin software(Cimel Electronique) were <0.01. It measures wavelengths of 340, 380, 440, 500, 670, 870, 1020 and 1640 nm and obtains the optical properties of aerosols from sky brightness and direct solar radiation measurements in the 440, 500, 670, 870, 1020 and 1640 nm channels, combined with direct solar AOD detection at the same wave- lengths [13,14,22,57\u201359]. These inversion data include the coarse and \ufb01ne mode aerosol volume concentrations, the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent at 440\u2013870 nm, the aerosol size distribution (dV/dlnr in the range 0.05\u201315 \u00b5m), the single scattering albedo (SSA), the absorbing aerosol Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 475 optical depth (AAOD), the absorbing \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent (AAE) and the direct aerosol radiative forcing (DARF) [11,56,58\u201360]. The computational model of DARF is as follows: F\u2193A \u2212 F\u2191A(cid:17) (cid:16) F\u2193C \u2212 F\u2191C(cid:17) (cid:16) \u2212 DARF = DARFTOA"}, {"question": " What computational model is used to calculate the direct aerosol radiative forcing (DARF) based on the data collected?,        answer: The computational model of DARF is used to calculate the direct aerosol radiative forcing based on the collected data.

Heavy pollution events (HPEs) were studied in the Beijing area during autumn and winter in 2017\u20132020 and the HPEs were divided into an early transport stage and a cumulating stage [49\u201355]. Southerly winds prevailed in the Beijing area during the transport stage and pollutants from south of Beijing were transported to the city. The solar radiation reaching the near-ground layer was reduced in the cumulating phase as a result of the extinction effect of particulate matter. This generated or enhanced the inversion layer and increased the relative humidity, which, in turn, inhibited turbulence, decreased the height of the boundary layer and inhibited the diffusion of pollutants. The higher relative humidity also promoted the hygroscopic growth of aerosols, accelerated liquid-phase and non-homogeneous-phase reactions, and increased the concentration of pollutants. This, in turn, led to a further deterioration in the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer. This two-way feedback mechanism has an important role in the formation and maintenance of heavy pollution in Beijing. Most of the rapid increase in pollutants in these studies started from around 12:00 to 17:00 [49\u201355]. However, most studies have been based on overall measurements of a vertical atmospheric column without considering the vertical distribution of aerosols. There have been relatively few studies on the optical properties of aerosols and their in\ufb02uence on the development of pollution on a vertical scale. We therefore need detailed information on the vertical distribution and optical properties of aerosols to further investigate their interconnection with, and in\ufb02uence on, the meteorological conditions in the boundary layer.
