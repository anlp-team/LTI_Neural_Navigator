In summary, exhausted CD8+TILs in the high CTL group exhibited abnormal biological changes in addition to high IC expression, suggesting a more severe degree of CD8+TILs exhaustion in the high CTL group than in the low CTL group, eventually resulting in tumor proliferation (32) and poor prognosis. Notably, one case in the low CTL group showed severe exhaustion of CD8+TILs, indicating the need for a detailed investigation. In addition to predicting survival risk, our study is helpful for dynamically monitoring the anti-tumor function of CD8+TILs in patients based on their exhaustion status in AITL and can provide suggestions for developing individualized therapeutic approaches. Patients with AITL showing more exhausted CD8+TILs should be screened for poor prognosis, especially in case of high CD8+TILs and CTL levels, and the most important and ideal treatment is to recover the effector function of CD8+TILs. Immunotherapy targeting IC (33) and immunosuppressive cytokines (34) can also be adopted in combination with routine chemotherapy to improve patient prognosis. Furthermore, a high proportion of CD8+TILs indicators of and CTL levels can also serve as novel treatment response. Interestingly, we identi\ufb01ed a few cases with high CD8+TILs or high CTL levels who showed good prognosis (data not shown), and CD8+TILs from these cases demonstrated low expression and few types of IC. These results imply that the high in\ufb01ltration of normal CD8+TILs in AITL can effectively exert anti-tumor function, which is valuable in designing individualized immunotherapy for patients with AITL and needs further exploration. In conclusion, our research demonstrated that the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL was characterized by the high expression of multiple IC. The greater the number of CD8+TILs, the greater was the proportion of severely exhausted CD8+TILs, accompanied by extensive exhaustion-related biological changes, which may be one of the main reasons underlying the poor prognosis of patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL (Figure 9).

In addition to predicting survival risk, our study is helpful for dynamically monitoring the anti-tumor function of CD8+TILs in patients based on their exhaustion status in AITL and can provide suggestions for developing individualized therapeutic approaches. Patients with AITL showing more exhausted CD8+TILs should be screened for poor prognosis, especially in case of high CD8+TILs and CTL levels, and the most important and ideal treatment is to recover the effector function of CD8+TILs. Immunotherapy targeting IC (33) and immunosuppressive cytokines (34) can also be adopted in combination with routine chemotherapy to improve patient prognosis. Furthermore, a high proportion of CD8+TILs indicators of and CTL levels can also serve as novel treatment response. Interestingly, we identi\ufb01ed a few cases with high CD8+TILs or high CTL levels who showed good prognosis (data not shown), and CD8+TILs from these cases demonstrated low expression and few types of IC. These results imply that the high in\ufb01ltration of normal CD8+TILs in AITL can effectively exert anti-tumor function, which is valuable in designing individualized immunotherapy for patients with AITL and needs further exploration. In conclusion, our research demonstrated that the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL was characterized by the high expression of multiple IC. The greater the number of CD8+TILs, the greater was the proportion of severely exhausted CD8+TILs, accompanied by extensive exhaustion-related biological changes, which may be one of the main reasons underlying the poor prognosis of patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL (Figure 9).

In summary, exhausted CD8+TILs in the high CTL group exhibited abnormal biological changes in addition to high IC expression, suggesting a more severe degree of CD8+TILs exhaustion in the high CTL group than in the low CTL group, eventually resulting in tumor proliferation (32) and poor prognosis. Notably, one case in the low CTL group showed severe exhaustion of CD8+TILs, indicating the need for a detailed investigation. In addition to predicting survival risk, our study is helpful for dynamically monitoring the anti-tumor function of CD8+TILs in patients based on their exhaustion status in AITL and can provide suggestions for developing individualized therapeutic approaches. Patients with AITL showing more exhausted CD8+TILs should be screened for poor prognosis, especially in case of high CD8+TILs and CTL levels, and the most important and ideal treatment is to recover the effector function of CD8+TILs. Immunotherapy targeting IC (33) and immunosuppressive cytokines (34) can also be adopted in combination with routine chemotherapy to improve patient prognosis. Furthermore, a high proportion of CD8+TILs indicators of and CTL levels can also serve as novel treatment response. Interestingly, we identi\ufb01ed a few cases with high CD8+TILs or high CTL levels who showed good prognosis (data not shown), and CD8+TILs from these cases demonstrated low expression and few types of IC. These results imply that the high in\ufb01ltration of normal CD8+TILs in AITL can effectively exert anti-tumor function, which is valuable in designing individualized immunotherapy for patients with AITL and needs further exploration. In conclusion, our research demonstrated that the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL was characterized by the high expression of multiple IC. The greater the number of CD8+TILs, the greater was the proportion of severely exhausted CD8+TILs, accompanied by extensive exhaustion-related biological changes, which may be one of the main reasons underlying the poor prognosis of patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL (Figure 9).

In summary, exhausted CD8+TILs in the high CTL group exhibited abnormal biological changes in addition to high IC expression, suggesting a more severe degree of CD8+TILs exhaustion in the high CTL group than in the low CTL group, eventually resulting in tumor proliferation (32) and poor prognosis. Notably, one case in the low CTL group showed severe exhaustion of CD8+TILs, indicating the need for a detailed investigation. In addition to predicting survival risk, our study is helpful for dynamically monitoring the anti-tumor function of CD8+TILs in patients based on their exhaustion status in AITL and can provide suggestions for developing individualized therapeutic approaches. Patients with AITL showing more exhausted CD8+TILs should be screened for poor prognosis, especially in case of high CD8+TILs and CTL levels, and the most important and ideal treatment is to recover the effector function of CD8+TILs. Immunotherapy targeting IC (33) and immunosuppressive cytokines (34) can also be adopted in combination with routine chemotherapy to improve patient prognosis. Furthermore, a high proportion of CD8+TILs indicators of and CTL levels can also serve as novel treatment response. Interestingly, we identi\ufb01ed a few cases with high CD8+TILs or high CTL levels who showed good prognosis (data not shown), and CD8+TILs from these cases demonstrated low expression and few types of IC. These results imply that the high in\ufb01ltration of normal CD8+TILs in AITL can effectively exert anti-tumor function, which is valuable in designing individualized immunotherapy for patients with AITL and needs further exploration. In conclusion, our research demonstrated that the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL was characterized by the high expression of multiple IC. The greater the number of CD8+TILs, the greater was the proportion of severely exhausted CD8+TILs, accompanied by extensive exhaustion-related biological changes, which may be one of the main reasons underlying the poor prognosis of patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL (Figure 9).

High proportions of CD8+TILs or high CTL in AITL indicated higher expression level and more types of IC, accompanied by extensive biological changes related to exhaustion, which suggested severe exhaustion of CD8+TILs and impairment of immune responses, resulting in poor prognosis. Meanwhile, the high proportion of CD8+TILs or high CTL with low expression of IC indicated good prognosis in AITL, suggesting that the normal CD8+TILs could effectively exert anti-tumor functions. Our \ufb01ndings regarding CD8+TILs exhaustion status could not only help predict the survival risk of patients with AITL but also facilitate further mechanistic studies and are valuable in guiding immunotherapy strategies. informed consent for participation from the participants or the participants\u2019 legal guardians/next of kin.
