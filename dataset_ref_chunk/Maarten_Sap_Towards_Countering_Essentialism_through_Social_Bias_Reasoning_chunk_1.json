In our work, we conduct exploratory studies into the task of countering essentialist beliefs (e.g., \u201cliberals are stupid\u201d). Drawing on prior work from psychology and NLP, we construct \ufb01ve types of counterstatements and conduct human studies on the effectiveness of these dif- ferent strategies. Our studies also investigate the role in choosing a counterstatement of the level of explicitness with which an essential- ist belief is conveyed. We \ufb01nd that statements that broaden the scope of a stereotype (e.g., to other groups, as in \u201cconservatives can also be stupid\u201d) are the most popular countering strat- egy. We conclude with a discussion of chal- lenges and open questions for future work in this area (e.g., improving factuality, studying community-speci\ufb01c variation) and we empha- size the importance of work at the intersection of NLP and psychology. Figure 1: Two prejudiced statements with their es- sentialist implications (top), along with our \ufb01ve types of counterstatements automatically generated with our method. According to our results, a preferred strategy is highlighting that an implication applies to more than the targeted group (LOTS or ALTS). 1 Introduction Essentialism, i.e., the belief that members of the same group are fundamentally alike, plays a cru- cial role in how prejudices and biases about social and demographic groups are formed and expressed (Leslie, 2014). For example, the statement \u201cI speak English, I don\u2019t speak libt*rd\u201d implies the belief that all \u201cliberals are stupid.\u201d If left unchallenged, statements with such essentializing implications can cause harm by perpetuating and reifying stereo- typical beliefs about social groups (Greenwald and Banaji, 1995; Steele, 2011; Prentice and Miller, 2007; Rhodes et al., 2012; Leshin et al., 2021). In this work, we investigate the task of com- bating essentialist statements and beliefs through psychologically and linguistically informed coun- terstatement generation. We examine these essen- tialist beliefs through the lens of generics (Rhodes et al., 2012), i.e., beliefs that attribute a quality to a target group without explicit quanti\ufb01cation (\u201cliber- als are stupid\u201d; Abelson and Kanouse, 1966; Carl- son and Pelletier, 1995). In the context of toxic or hateful language, these generic beliefs can be both expressed directly or conveyed through subtle implications (Gelman, 2003; Sap et al., 2020). Automatically countering essentialism is chal- lenging because it requires deep psychological rea- soning about the linguistic implications of state- ments \u2013 for example, changing people\u2019s beliefs about stereotypes only through counterexamples is dif\ufb01cult (Kunda and Oleson, 1995). Therefore, we examine \ufb01ve different strategies for combat- ing essentializing stereotypes, combining insights from psychology (Foster-Hanson et al., 2016, 2019; Wodak et al., 2015) and NLP (Allaway et al., 2023). We craft \ufb01ve types of statements (see Fig 1): broad- ening the scope of a stereotype by generalizing to \u201call people\u201d or an alternative group (LOTS and ALT), providing direct counter-evidence through speci\ufb01c individuals or groups (DIR-IND and DIR- GRP), and simply calling out the generalization In contrast to prior studies on counter- (TOL). ing hate-speech which use uncontrolled end-to-end generation approaches (Qian et al., 2019; Zhu and Bhat, 2021; Chung et al., 2020, e.g.,), we gener- ate counterstatements by reasoning directly about the targeted group, attributed quality, and linguistic expression of a stereotype. Since our work provides a preliminary explo- ration of this task, we conduct online studies in three settings where counterstatements are paired with human-written implications from the Social Bias Frames Inference Corpus (SBIC) (Sap et al., 2020). In these settings, we explore variation in counterstatement effectiveness when the beliefs are conveyed either implicitly, explicitly without con- text, or as an explicit inference from provided con- text. We \ufb01nd that challenging a stereotype by ap- plying it broadly (e.g., to \u201clots of people\u201d; LOTS and ALTS; Figure 1) is generally the most preferred strategy. In contrast, statements containing direct counter-evidence (e.g., DIR-IND and DIR-GRP; Figure 1) are the least popular. Additionally, we observe that the most favored strategy varies de- pending on whether the stereotype is explicitly pre- sented to annotators (e.g., providing the essentialist belief in Figure 1) or only conveyed implicitly (e.g., only providing the \ufb01rst statement in Figure 1). For example, direct counter-evidence is more popular when the stereotype is explicitly provided. Our re- sults highlight the complexity of countering essen- tialist beliefs and the importance of further investi- gation at the intersection of NLP and psychology. 2 Automatically Countering Essentialism We operationalize our counterstatement genera- tion by focusing on the expression of stereotypes through generics (\u00a72.1). Inspired by work in psy- chology and philosophy, we construct \ufb01ve types of counterstatements to a stereotype (\u00a72.2). 2.1 Stereotypes as Generics Many negative stereotypes are expressed as gener- ics; they generalize a dangerous or harmful quality (e.g., being a drunkard) to an entire group (e.g., Scots) based on the behavior of only a few indi- viduals.

For example, the statement \u201cI speak English, I don\u2019t speak libt*rd\u201d implies the belief that all \u201cliberals are stupid.\u201d If left unchallenged, statements with such essentializing implications can cause harm by perpetuating and reifying stereo- typical beliefs about social groups (Greenwald and Banaji, 1995; Steele, 2011; Prentice and Miller, 2007; Rhodes et al., 2012; Leshin et al., 2021). In this work, we investigate the task of com- bating essentialist statements and beliefs through psychologically and linguistically informed coun- terstatement generation. We examine these essen- tialist beliefs through the lens of generics (Rhodes et al., 2012), i.e., beliefs that attribute a quality to a target group without explicit quanti\ufb01cation (\u201cliber- als are stupid\u201d; Abelson and Kanouse, 1966; Carl- son and Pelletier, 1995). In the context of toxic or hateful language, these generic beliefs can be both expressed directly or conveyed through subtle implications (Gelman, 2003; Sap et al., 2020). Automatically countering essentialism is chal- lenging because it requires deep psychological rea- soning about the linguistic implications of state- ments \u2013 for example, changing people\u2019s beliefs about stereotypes only through counterexamples is dif\ufb01cult (Kunda and Oleson, 1995). Therefore, we examine \ufb01ve different strategies for combat- ing essentializing stereotypes, combining insights from psychology (Foster-Hanson et al., 2016, 2019; Wodak et al., 2015) and NLP (Allaway et al., 2023). We craft \ufb01ve types of statements (see Fig 1): broad- ening the scope of a stereotype by generalizing to \u201call people\u201d or an alternative group (LOTS and ALT), providing direct counter-evidence through speci\ufb01c individuals or groups (DIR-IND and DIR- GRP), and simply calling out the generalization In contrast to prior studies on counter- (TOL). ing hate-speech which use uncontrolled end-to-end generation approaches (Qian et al., 2019; Zhu and Bhat, 2021; Chung et al., 2020, e.g.,), we gener- ate counterstatements by reasoning directly about the targeted group, attributed quality, and linguistic expression of a stereotype. Since our work provides a preliminary explo- ration of this task, we conduct online studies in three settings where counterstatements are paired with human-written implications from the Social Bias Frames Inference Corpus (SBIC) (Sap et al., 2020). In these settings, we explore variation in counterstatement effectiveness when the beliefs are conveyed either implicitly, explicitly without con- text, or as an explicit inference from provided con- text. We \ufb01nd that challenging a stereotype by ap- plying it broadly (e.g., to \u201clots of people\u201d; LOTS and ALTS; Figure 1) is generally the most preferred strategy. In contrast, statements containing direct counter-evidence (e.g., DIR-IND and DIR-GRP; Figure 1) are the least popular. Additionally, we observe that the most favored strategy varies de- pending on whether the stereotype is explicitly pre- sented to annotators (e.g., providing the essentialist belief in Figure 1) or only conveyed implicitly (e.g., only providing the \ufb01rst statement in Figure 1). For example, direct counter-evidence is more popular when the stereotype is explicitly provided. Our re- sults highlight the complexity of countering essen- tialist beliefs and the importance of further investi- gation at the intersection of NLP and psychology. 2 Automatically Countering Essentialism We operationalize our counterstatement genera- tion by focusing on the expression of stereotypes through generics (\u00a72.1). Inspired by work in psy- chology and philosophy, we construct \ufb01ve types of counterstatements to a stereotype (\u00a72.2). 2.1 Stereotypes as Generics Many negative stereotypes are expressed as gener- ics; they generalize a dangerous or harmful quality (e.g., being a drunkard) to an entire group (e.g., Scots) based on the behavior of only a few indi- viduals.

In these settings, we explore variation in counterstatement effectiveness when the beliefs are conveyed either implicitly, explicitly without con- text, or as an explicit inference from provided con- text. We \ufb01nd that challenging a stereotype by ap- plying it broadly (e.g., to \u201clots of people\u201d; LOTS and ALTS; Figure 1) is generally the most preferred strategy. In contrast, statements containing direct counter-evidence (e.g., DIR-IND and DIR-GRP; Figure 1) are the least popular. Additionally, we observe that the most favored strategy varies de- pending on whether the stereotype is explicitly pre- sented to annotators (e.g., providing the essentialist belief in Figure 1) or only conveyed implicitly (e.g., only providing the \ufb01rst statement in Figure 1). For example, direct counter-evidence is more popular when the stereotype is explicitly provided. Our re- sults highlight the complexity of countering essen- tialist beliefs and the importance of further investi- gation at the intersection of NLP and psychology. 2 Automatically Countering Essentialism We operationalize our counterstatement genera- tion by focusing on the expression of stereotypes through generics (\u00a72.1).

According to our results, a preferred strategy is highlighting that an implication applies to more than the targeted group (LOTS or ALTS). 1 Introduction Essentialism, i.e., the belief that members of the same group are fundamentally alike, plays a cru- cial role in how prejudices and biases about social and demographic groups are formed and expressed (Leslie, 2014). For example, the statement \u201cI speak English, I don\u2019t speak libt*rd\u201d implies the belief that all \u201cliberals are stupid.\u201d If left unchallenged, statements with such essentializing implications can cause harm by perpetuating and reifying stereo- typical beliefs about social groups (Greenwald and Banaji, 1995; Steele, 2011; Prentice and Miller, 2007; Rhodes et al., 2012; Leshin et al., 2021). In this work, we investigate the task of com- bating essentialist statements and beliefs through psychologically and linguistically informed coun- terstatement generation. We examine these essen- tialist beliefs through the lens of generics (Rhodes et al., 2012), i.e., beliefs that attribute a quality to a target group without explicit quanti\ufb01cation (\u201cliber- als are stupid\u201d; Abelson and Kanouse, 1966; Carl- son and Pelletier, 1995). In the context of toxic or hateful language, these generic beliefs can be both expressed directly or conveyed through subtle implications (Gelman, 2003; Sap et al., 2020). Automatically countering essentialism is chal- lenging because it requires deep psychological rea- soning about the linguistic implications of state- ments \u2013 for example, changing people\u2019s beliefs about stereotypes only through counterexamples is dif\ufb01cult (Kunda and Oleson, 1995). Therefore, we examine \ufb01ve different strategies for combat- ing essentializing stereotypes, combining insights from psychology (Foster-Hanson et al., 2016, 2019; Wodak et al., 2015) and NLP (Allaway et al., 2023).
