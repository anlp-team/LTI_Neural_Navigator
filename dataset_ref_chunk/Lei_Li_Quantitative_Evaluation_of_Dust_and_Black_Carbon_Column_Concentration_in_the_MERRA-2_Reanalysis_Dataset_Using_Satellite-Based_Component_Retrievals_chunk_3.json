[40], which is open-source code at https://www.grasp-open.com. Briefly, in the GRASP/Component approach, the refractive index of each component, together with fractions, is used by the forward model for estimating the refractive index of an aerosol mixture to simulate remote sensing measurements. Therefore, aerosol species, including black carbon, brown carbon, mineral dust, soluble inorganic salts, etc., can be obtained by the component approach [39,40]. In the current component products [39], a mixing rule of Maxwell\u2013Garnett (MG) approximation that considers different insoluble species mixing in the soluble host was employed for the calculation of aerosol mixture components. The quality-filtered prod-ucts with the measured resolution are represented in Level-2. The products with different resolutions of 0.1\u00b0 and 1\u00b0 are represented in Level-3. Here, in this study, the GRASP/Com-ponent mineral dust and black carbon retrievals are re-gridded into the resolution of 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.625\u00b0 to compare with the corresponding MERRA-2 products using the quality-filtered GRASP/Component products with the resolution of 0.1\u00b0 [39]. It is noted that based on the sensitivity tests and uncertainty assessments [39\u201341], the uncertainties in BC retrievals are about 50% or smaller for moderate and high aerosol loading (AOD at 440 nm \u2265 0.4) and when the proportion of BC is higher than 0.01. The estimated uncertainty for the mineral dust retrieval decreases significantly (from 100% to below 50%) when the proportion of dust is higher than 0.1.

Results and Discussion This section presents the comparisons of mineral dust and BC column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals in the global key regions for the period from March 2005 to October 2013. It provides a fun-damental evaluation of the quality of aerosol component reanalysis fields using the satel-lite-measured aerosol component concentration to examine the magnitude of mineral dust and BC column concentration because measured aerosol component concentration data were not assimilated in the MERRA-2 reanalysis. 3.1. Dust Column Concentration There are many natural dust emission sources globally, such as the Sahara region [8,44], the Middle East, Arabian Peninsula [8,9], Taklamakan desert in northwestern China, and Gobi desert across northern China\u2013southern Mongolia [9], etc., making dust particles have major contributions to aerosol mass loading. The prevailing winds can take the dust particles to long-distance areas up to thousands of kilometers from emission sources. For instance, the Atlantic Ocean is under the influence of dust particles emitted from the Sahara region in North Africa [45\u201347]. Dust aerosols also can be transported from the Sahara Desert in North Africa toward the Mediterranean and Europe [48,49]. There-fore, some key regions of dust deserts and downwind dust-dominated regions globally (shown in Figure 1) are selected to investigate the differences in mineral dust column con-centration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component re-trievals. 3.1.1.

The estimated uncertainty for the mineral dust retrieval decreases significantly (from 100% to below 50%) when the proportion of dust is higher than 0.1. The component retrieval uncertainties are mainly associated with the refractive index of each component employed by the assumption in the component algorithm [40]. 2.3. Regions of Interest 2.3.1. Dust Desert and Downwind Dust-Dominated Regions Figure 1 shows the regions of interest for the comparisons of monthly dust column concentration between satellite-measured retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis data in the following assessment analysis. The monthly comparisons are performed for mineral dust column concentration over these specific regions of interest. The full names of each region, as well as the corresponding defined areas, are listed in Table 1 [42]. The regions of the Sahara Desert (SAH), Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression (BOD), Middle East (MIE), Taklamakan Desert (TAK), and Gobi Desert (GOB) with solid rectangles represent dust emission resource re-gions.

Results and Discussion This section presents the comparisons of mineral dust and BC column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals in the global key regions for the period from March 2005 to October 2013. It provides a fun-damental evaluation of the quality of aerosol component reanalysis fields using the satel-lite-measured aerosol component concentration to examine the magnitude of mineral dust and BC column concentration because measured aerosol component concentration data were not assimilated in the MERRA-2 reanalysis. 3.1. Dust Column Concentration There are many natural dust emission sources globally, such as the Sahara region [8,44], the Middle East, Arabian Peninsula [8,9], Taklamakan desert in northwestern China, and Gobi desert across northern China\u2013southern Mongolia [9], etc., making dust particles have major contributions to aerosol mass loading. The prevailing winds can take the dust particles to long-distance areas up to thousands of kilometers from emission sources. For instance, the Atlantic Ocean is under the influence of dust particles emitted from the Sahara region in North Africa [45\u201347]. Dust aerosols also can be transported from the Sahara Desert in North Africa toward the Mediterranean and Europe [48,49]. There-fore, some key regions of dust deserts and downwind dust-dominated regions globally (shown in Figure 1) are selected to investigate the differences in mineral dust column con-centration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component re-trievals. 3.1.1.

Briefly, in the GRASP/Component approach, the refractive index of each component, together with fractions, is used by the forward model for estimating the refractive index of an aerosol mixture to simulate remote sensing measurements. Therefore, aerosol species, including black carbon, brown carbon, mineral dust, soluble inorganic salts, etc., can be obtained by the component approach [39,40].

There-fore, some key regions of dust deserts and downwind dust-dominated regions globally (shown in Figure 1) are selected to investigate the differences in mineral dust column con-centration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component re-trievals. 3.1.1. Sahara Desert The Sahara (SAH) desert region is of great interest in the comparison of satellite-measured and MERRA-2 dust column concentrations with the most active and extensive natural dust sources. According to Figure 3, both GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product can capture well the variation in monthly dust column concen-tration over the SAH region. Specifically, GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present the same trend of"}, {"question": " What trend do GRASP/Component dust retrieval and MERRA-2 dust product present over the Sahara (SAH) desert region in terms of monthly dust column concentration?,answer: They both capture well the variation in monthly dust column concentration over the SAH region with the same trend.", "ref_chunk": "BC is higher than 0.01. The estimated uncertainty for the mineral dust retrieval decreases signi\ufb01cantly (from 100% to below 50%) when the proportion of dust is higher than 0.1. The component retrieval uncertainties are mainly associated with the refractive index of each component employed by the assumption in the component algorithm [40]. 2.3. Regions of Interest 2.3.1. Dust Desert and Downwind Dust-Dominated Regions Figure 1 shows the regions of interest for the comparisons of monthly dust column concentration between satellite-measured retrievals and MERRA-2 reanalysis data in the following assessment analysis. The monthly comparisons are performed for mineral dust column concentration over these speci\ufb01c regions of interest. The full names of each region, as well as the corresponding de\ufb01ned areas, are listed in Table 1 [42]. The regions of the Sahara Desert (SAH), Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression (BOD), Middle East (MIE), Taklamakan Desert (TAK), and Gobi Desert (GOB) with solid rectangles represent dust emission resource regions.

[40], which is open-source code at https://www.grasp-open.com. Briefly, in the GRASP/Component approach, the refractive index of each component, together with fractions, is used by the forward model for estimating the refractive index of an aerosol mixture to simulate remote sensing measurements. Therefore, aerosol species, including black carbon, brown carbon, mineral dust, soluble inorganic salts, etc., can be obtained by the component approach [39,40]. In the current component products [39], a mixing rule of Maxwell\u2013Garnett (MG) approximation that considers different insoluble species mixing in the soluble host was employed for the calculation of aerosol mixture components. The quality-filtered prod-ucts with the measured resolution are represented in Level-2. The products with different resolutions of 0.1\u00b0 and 1\u00b0 are represented in Level-3. Here, in this study, the GRASP/Com-ponent mineral dust and black carbon retrievals are re-gridded into the resolution of 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.625\u00b0 to compare with the corresponding MERRA-2 products using the quality-filtered GRASP/Component products with the resolution of 0.1\u00b0 [39]. It is noted that based on the sensitivity tests and uncertainty assessments [39\u201341], the uncertainties in BC retrievals are about 50% or smaller for moderate and high aerosol loading (AOD at 440 nm \u2265 0.4) and when the proportion of BC is higher than 0.01. The estimated uncertainty for the mineral dust retrieval decreases significantly (from 100% to below 50%) when the proportion of dust is higher than 0.1.

Results and Discussion This section presents the comparisons of mineral dust and BC column concentration between the MERAA-2 reanalysis dataset and POLDER/GRASP component retrievals in the global key regions for the period from March 2005 to October 2013. It provides a fun-damental evaluation of the quality of aerosol component reanalysis fields using the satel-lite-measured aerosol component concentration to examine the magnitude of mineral dust and BC column concentration because measured aerosol component concentration data were not assimilated in the MERRA-2 reanalysis. 3.1.
