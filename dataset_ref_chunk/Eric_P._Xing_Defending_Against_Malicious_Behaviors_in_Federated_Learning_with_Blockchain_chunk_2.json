Blockchain technology has gained widespread attention for its potential to revolutionize a variety of indus- tries, such as finance [9], healthcare [11], and supply chain management [12]. By leveraging the decentralized nature of the blockchain, FL can benefit from increased security, privacy, and efficiency, as well as reduced reliance on centralized servers [13]. Concretely, in FL with blockchain, each client participating in the learning process uploads their local model updates to the blockchain, where they are stored in blocks, the metadata of a blockchain system. These blocks are then used to aggregate the local model updates into a global model, which can be downloaded by the clients. The use of blockchain smart contracts [9], which are computer programs triggered by blockchain events, ensures that the global aggregation process is performed automatically and transparently, without the need for human intervention or centralized control. spies while the spies aim to impersonate the resistance force and survive until the end. Based on these two concepts, this work proposes a novel majority-voting mechanism for global aggregation where each participating client independently val- idates the quality of aggregated local updates and votes for acceptance of the global update. The aggregation mechanism is stake-based where participating clients stake assets1 or tokens (a quantitative measurement of the asset, which can be used to indicate the trustworthiness of the client in our system) for their own actions. There are two types of actions, proposing (uploading local updates) and voting. If the majority vote is to accept the global aggregation, a proposer will be refunded with its staked tokens and a voter who votes for acceptance will not only be refunded but also be rewarded with the staked tokens from the voters who vote for rejection, and vice versa. The overall procedure of the stake-based aggregation mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 1. We evaluate the proposed framework on a practical financial problem, namely loan default prediction. We simulate the FL and blockchain environment for the Lending Club Kaggle challenge dataset to conduct experiments in a controllable setting and to provide insights into the problem of interest. We empirically show that an FL system can maintain robust performance under malicious attacks by introducing the pro- posed stake-based aggregation mechanism. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: 1) We formulate the problem of decentralized federated learning with blockchain in the presence of malicious attacks. 2) We propose a stake-based aggregation mechanism for federated learning systems that can defend against ma- licious attacks. Though integrating blockchain with existing FL systems can partially solve the threat to the central server, FL systems are still vulnerable to client-side malicious attacks [14]. In this work, we define malicious behaviors as actions that inten- tionally decrease the learning performance (e.g. accuracy and convergence) of the global model. The attackers can sabotage the FL systems via attacks such as data poisoning [15] or model poisoning [14]. This work focuses on defending against client-side malicious attacks. We propose a generic framework that can integrate an FL system with a blockchain system and can defend against malicious attacks. The proposed defense mechanism is mo- tivated by proof-of-stake (PoS) [16], a consensus mechanism in blockchain, and The Resistance [17], a role-playing board game. PoS has an incentive mechanism that encourages honest behaviors by rewarding it and punishes dishonest behaviors via slashing. The Resistance, on the other hand, has two mismatched competing parties, where the party with a larger size is denoted as the resistance force and the other party is denoted as the spies. In The Resistance, there is a voting mechanism where, in each round, each player conducts inde- pendent reasoning and votes for a player, and the player with the highest votes will be deemed as a \u201cspy\u201d and kicked out of the game.

RELATED WORK A. Federated Learning The concept of FL comes from the necessity of on-device training, where the training data have to remain on the de- vice [6]. The clients of FL are distributed at different physical locations that are connected to the internet, which exposes a few security risks compared with distributed learning. First, as the local dataset belongs to the client, FL has to take the users\u2019 privacy into consideration. This can be addressed by integrating privacy-preserving techniques into FL, such as differential privacy [18]. Second, FL can be manipulated via internet access, e.g. the central server can be compromised by a third party. Third, a new client could participate in the federated training at any time if it meets the required criteria. This means that clients with malicious intentions can also join the federated systems while meeting the initial criteria. This work focuses on the third risk as the second risk is mitigated by replacing the central server with a blockchain. Traditional FL methods can only detect and defend the malicious clients 1In practice, the staked assets can be linked with cryptocurrency or real currency to increase the financial cost of malicious attacks.

There are two types of actions, proposing (uploading local updates) and voting. If the majority vote is to accept the global aggregation, a proposer will be refunded with its staked tokens and a voter who votes for acceptance will not only be refunded but also be rewarded with the staked tokens from the voters who vote for rejection, and vice versa. The overall procedure of the stake-based aggregation mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 1. We evaluate the proposed framework on a practical financial problem, namely loan default prediction. We simulate the FL and blockchain environment for the Lending Club Kaggle challenge dataset to conduct experiments in a controllable setting and to provide insights into the problem of interest. We empirically show that an FL system can maintain robust performance under malicious attacks by introducing the pro- posed stake-based aggregation mechanism. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: 1) We formulate the problem of decentralized federated learning with blockchain in the presence of malicious attacks. 2) We propose a stake-based aggregation mechanism for federated learning systems that can defend against ma- licious attacks. Though integrating blockchain with existing FL systems can partially solve the threat to the central server, FL systems are still vulnerable to client-side malicious attacks [14]. In this work, we define malicious behaviors as actions that inten- tionally decrease the learning performance (e.g. accuracy and convergence) of the global model. The attackers can sabotage the FL systems via attacks such as data poisoning [15] or model poisoning [14]. This work focuses on defending against client-side malicious attacks. We propose a generic framework that can integrate an FL system with a blockchain system and can defend against malicious attacks. The proposed defense mechanism is mo- tivated by proof-of-stake (PoS) [16], a consensus mechanism in blockchain, and The Resistance [17], a role-playing board game.

RELATED WORK A. Federated Learning The concept of FL comes from the necessity of on-device training, where the training data have to remain on the de- vice [6]. The clients of FL are distributed at different physical locations that are connected to the internet, which exposes a few security risks compared with distributed learning. First, as the local dataset belongs to the client, FL has to take the users\u2019 privacy into consideration. This can be addressed by integrating privacy-preserving techniques into FL, such as differential privacy [18]. Second, FL can be manipulated via internet access, e.g. the central server can be compromised by a third party. Third, a new client could participate in the federated training at any time if it meets the required criteria. This means that clients with malicious intentions can also join the federated systems while meeting the initial criteria. This work focuses on the third risk as the second risk is mitigated by replacing the central server with a blockchain.
